And so when I read -- Tim inspired me when I read this post, and maybe I had an inkling of that idea somewhere, but he communicates it better than I can, that, wow, like, yes, that's not an accurate representation of reality. Humans are obsessed with themselves. And so in that sense, like lean into what makes you unique in -- I'm talking to myself now, I need to lean into what makes me unique, and I need to understand my own strengths. Yes, there's a lot of things about myself that I want to change, but I don't have control over. Like if you ever saw me in person, like I have a gigantic head like seriously, I was teased ruthlessly, an older brother and everybody -- my friends would come over in elementary school, right? And my brother would call me basketball head because I look a lollypop, because I was a skinny kid with this giant round head. And now -- like when I was a kid, it tormented me, but now I think it's funny because like maybe that's where I store all the stuff I read or like it just -- it just doesn't matter. And obviously, it grew into my head somewhat. But my point being is like when I was younger, I thought of it as a weakness. I wanted to change it. You're so -- you don't understand what you don't know when you're 8 or 10 or 12 years old and you're being teased about this stuff because I didn't finish, I thought -- my brother had said this in front of my friends and they took it back to school and then it just spread like wildfire. So then on, I was a basketball head. Now I think it's funny because I don't care, like I didn't control this. I didn't choose to have a giant head, but I do. So it is what it is. Like it's just silly to fret over things you can't control. And David, in large part, he also had a weird unbelievable belief in his talent and ability and yet at the same time, hated a lot of the stuff about himself. So this is why I'm so confused when I'm doing this podcast because this is a very confusing book and a very confusing person. So -- all right. Let's go back to more of its personality.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Complex, contentious, and blessed with the perfect-pitch ability to find the next big talent, David Geffen has shaped American popular culture and transformed the way Hollywood does business. His dazzling career has included the rules of power agent, record industry mogul, Broadway producer, and billionaire Hollywood studio founder. But from the beginning, his accomplishments have been shadowed by the ruthlessness with which he has pursued fame, money, and power. With The Operator, Tom King, who interviewed Geffen for the book and had an unimpeded access to his circle of intimates, presented a mesmerizing chronicle of Geffen’s meteoric rise from the mailroom at William Morris, as well as a captivating tour of 30 sizzling years of Hollywood history. Drawing on the recollections of celebrities such as Tom Cruise, Yoko Ono, Warren Beatty, Courtney Love, Paul Simon, and even Cher whom Geffen nearly married, The Operator transports readers to a world that is as ruthless as it is dazzling, revealing a great American story about success and the bargains made for it."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. So that is on the back cover of the book that I'm going to talk to you about today, which is The Operator. David Geffen builds, Buys and Sells the New Hollywood and it was written by Tom King. And I chose that excerpt to start the podcast with because I think it's a great like one paragraph overview of the life and career of David Geffen where you have this singularly focused intensely driven really talented entrepreneur, manager, businessperson and yet how -- in that short paragraph, the author uses the word ruthless twice. And that's in the other side to Geffen, where you have one of the most ruthless people that I think I've ever -- this is going to be an interesting podcast because he made -- he definitely is -- David Geffen is definitely one of the most ruthless people that I have ever covered on the podcast. And then I just want to finally point out that last sentence where he said, "It's a -- transports readers to a world that is as ruthless as it is dazzling, revealing a great American story about success and the bargains made for it." So just keep that in the back of your mind as we go through the book today about the bargains that David is making for the success that he achieved. So just two quick things before I jump into the rest of the book. One, this -- I found out about this book through a listener. So if you do have interesting founders that you want me to cover our books, you want me to analyze on the podcast, please continue to send them my way. And second, I just want to take a minute or two and talk about this idea that I feel you and I have been talking about frequently for a fairly long time. And that's this idea of soul in the game, and there's a bunch of different founders that I have covered, this is not a comprehensive list by any means, but you definitely see that you can always tell somebody has soul in the game by the way they approach their work, right? And so I think of people like Walt Disney, who I covered on Founders #2 and Founders #39. Steve Jobs, definitely, that's all in the game. Founders #5, 1976 and 77. I also have two bonus Steve Jobs episodes coming for -- on the Misfit feed here in the next few weeks as well. James Dyson, Founders #25. Let me pull up this quote. And this is how you kind of -- one, if somebody has soul in the game, you'll notice it, by the way they approach their work and the products they make, right, but also the way they talk. And so this is from James Dyson, his autobiography, which is one of my favorite books that I've ever read for the podcast. And this is what soul in the game sounds like when you're writing your autobiography. He says, this is not even a business book. It is anything or if anything, a book against business, against the principles that have filled the world with ugly useless objects and unhappy people.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I love the fact that one, he pokes fun. He's a very like cheeky writer if he read his book. He's very witty, but he also likes to talk. He likes to point out the ways in which his products are better. He's extremely confident in that manner. But I think that also, he hits on something else, like yes, there's a lot of -- just look at a lot of the products that you interact with, a lot of them are poorly made, ugly, maybe not -- poorly designed. That's why we try to celebrate excellence on this podcast. But he also hits on unhappy people. And this is my own belief that if every business was run by somebody with soul in the game, it would make everybody else's life better because it's a more pleasant experience, right? So there's -- so James Dyson is one of them. Another example that comes to mind is Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia. I covered him on Founders 18 and #60. Henry Royce of Rolls-Royce fame, of course, he had soul in the game, if you read that book or listened to Founders, #81, it's very obvious. Enzo Ferrari, maybe soul in the game personified. Guy was one of the most successive people that I have ever covered. Founders #97 and #98. And then most recently, I talked a lot about this with the founder of Adidas, who I didn't even know existed before I started reading his book or that book about him, and that's Adi Dassler, Founders #109. And so I want to read this paragraph because I was going through a bunch of my notes and thinking about this, this week. And I'm going to read this paragraph from this book called Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life by Nassim Taleb. And he's got an entire -- it's probably like 7 to 10 pages where he goes over his idea about what soul in the game is and how you can -- where you see -- like how it makes -- somebody with soul in the game makes it obvious that they have that, right? And then I'm going to tie it back to podcast and then I'm going to get into the book. I have a point here. Just bear with me for a second. So first, he says -- this is Taleb writing, he says, "Anything you do to optimize your work, cut corners or squeeze more efficiency out of it, will eventually make you dislike it."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And you know, I didn't -- I need to communicate clearly here. David Geffen did not have soul in the game, and that's why I'm choosing to talk about this here before we get into the book because you're going to see a great source of unhappiness, even though this guy has made billions and billions and billions of dollars, okay? So it says -- it eventually make you dislike it. Artisans have soul in the game, so now he's going to list like some of the characteristics of people who have soul in the game. Number one, artisans do things for accentual reasons first, financial and commercial ones later. Their decision-making is never fully financial, but it remains financial. Number two, they have some type of art in their profession. They stay away from most aspects of industrialization. They combine art and business. Three, they put some soul in their work. They would not sell something defective or even of compromised quality because it hurts their pride. Finally, the last one, they have sacred taboos, things they would not do even if it markedly increased profitability. Okay. So that's a good -- like a brief overview of what that means in case you haven't come across this term before. I personally prefer studying people that approach -- like they -- I mean what is the point of this whole podcast. if you think about what we're doing here, like why are we trying to learn from people, not only learn the good ideas they accumulate through the lifetime of their careers, but also avoid their bad mistakes is, I think it was Tim Urban, who introduced me to this idea, but I think it's like -- it's an old idea that 90% of your happiness or thereabouts, it comes on to two things in life, like who you surround yourself with so your spouse and your close friends and then what you do for living. And you're going to see here today, David Geffen in large part made a lot of money, but he was kind of tormented -- he not even kind of -- he was tormented in a lot of ways.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so when I bring up ideas about having soul in the game or studying people in the past is like -- if we can take these ideas, half of the time that we are awake assuming you work 8 hours a day, your sleep rate, you have 16 left where you're actually conscious. So it means you're going to work half of those, maybe a little less. If you take the weekends off where the case may be. So it's very important to find something that you like doing and to be -- to feel like you're progressing and you're getting better at your craft. So that's just this general idea because when I sat down, I was like, how am I going to talk about this book today? So I guess even before I jump into the book, let me just grab some notes of mine. And this might be a little different than I normally do because I'm pretty sure David Geffen is a sociopath. I'm almost positive. He's a sociopath. So if you see a profile of a sociopath, his glibness has superficial charm. He's manipulative and cunning. They never recognize the rights of others and see their self-serving behaviors as permissible. That's David Geffen. They have a grandiose sense of self. They pathologically lie. They have a lack of remorse, shallow motions and incapacity for love, and a need for stimulation. But here's the thing. Like it's not all -- the lessons I learned from reading this book are not all negative. He under -- I think one of the biggest things that David understood and that I took away from his life is an idea that I was first introduced by Steve Jobs. And David Geffen like Steve Jobs, and I think this is important for every single person living is they both understood that life is malleable. So let me pull up this quote. Steve talked about this a lot over several different decades in different contexts. So I'm going to give you two quotes about the same idea -- this is back -- I think this is in the early '90s. And Steve Jobs talking -- says "The minute you understand that you can poke life and actually something will pop out of the other side that you can change it, that you can mold it. That's maybe the most important thing.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. I found it. I'm not going to say who it is, this person has a fairly large audience, I'm not here to obviously criticize that. I just -- I want to contrast -- I have a different point of view than this. And I'm going to relate this to where we're at in David Geffen's story. So I rewound and made sure I had this correct because I could not believe my eyes. This person is talking, says there's something very beautiful about feeling very small and very weak to feel you need other people. No. Absolutely not. My entire existence is trying to make -- to learn and to make myself strong, so I can support myself, my family, and my loved one, so I never have to rely on the good graces of human beings. Because when you're very small -- history is -- I mean this person -- there's no way this person could have even a basic understanding of human history. Because when you're very small and very weak, you get taken advantage of. So this podcast is not about making you small or weak, it's about making you smarter and stronger. I have a very distinct point of view. I find -- we talked last week, I loved when Henry Singleton said that people that think for their short term repulse him. Well, this repulses me, the idea that we want to -- we ever want to celebrate weakness. Absolutely not. So here, we're going to see something that happened. Unfortunately, David Geffen's relatives are Jewish. And Batya's entire family. She escaped, right, her sister escaped. Everybody else was killed by the Nazi's. And this is what happened. So she hadn't talked to -- she escaped -- she's the only one that escaped to the United States, right? She tries to locate her sister Deena. She finds Deena in -- this is -- they haven't spoken in about, I think, 20 years at this point, right? And so she -- Batya had not heard from her sister, or any of other family members, right? So by a scream, "Oh, my God, Deena, how are you?" And she goes, "I'm fine, but I'm the only one alive. Everyone else is dead." And so Batya, obviously, she didn't know -- this happened to her family years before.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It's to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you're just going to live it -- are you going to live in it, excuse me, versus embrace it, change it, improve it and make your mark upon it." David Geffen definitely shaped his life. Steve Jobs continued later on. He says, "When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is. And then your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. But that's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. You can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again." So not only did Steve know that, David Geffen knew that, I think almost every single person I have studied in the podcast. That's what I think reading biographies is so inspirational because they start out as poor broken people in many cases, and they build themselves into what they become. They poke life, they change it, it is malleable. So that's a positive that I learned from David, right? But the negative is he didn't work on something he loved. I'm going to go into more detail that in a minute. He was sociopathic, I already told you that. And he was always unhappy. He was obsessed with money, but then he was surprised it didn't make him happy. And then second, the note out of myself is he would abuse people, break his word and then the same talented people would then sign back on him, whether they worked on -- from one of his movies in the future even though he abuses them or they resent his record label after he lied to them. And then what I tell myself is like don't be like that. When you identify people -- I was sitting here thinking, I was like, what is the -- like what is the strategy here, David. If you were to run into a David Geffen kind of person in your life, what would I do?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I thought about that when I put the book down and finally finished it, and I came up with a short idea, that's probably the correct -- the correct route to go, avoidance. You can't have people like this in your life. All right. So let me jump into the book. Hopefully, that preamble that made a bit of sense to you. Oh, man, you can -- the story is crazy. All right. You'll see when I get into it. So first, I'm going to jump into the foreword. And here, we have the author Tom King talking about, it took him a while to convince David to give him access to write a book about him. So he says, I told him that I wanted to write a book about him. Geffen was aggressively opposed to the idea and quickly ended the conversation. A week or so later, I called him again. He somewhat had -- he softened somewhat because he told me that he recently read Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist. Warren Buffett was Geffen's hero, and he applied that he would be pleased if his life merited a similar treatment. So it's one thing that you're going to realize about Geffen is he was heavily influenced by reading biographies of people he admired. Warren Buffett is one of those people, the other person that he wanted to pattern his career after was the founder -- one of the founders of MGM, Louis B. Mayer. I'll get there in a minute. So eventually, Geffen gives in, and he says, "Okay, yes, you know what, this would be great." Like he's extremely confident, egotistical and so he's like, this would be great if my life -- if somebody wrote a book about me, the way they wrote a book about Buffett. But the problem is, Geffen is not Warren Buffett. He doesn't have the same temperament by any means. So I'm going to start still in the foreword, I'm going to talk about like some of these personalities and strengths, okay? This is going to give you an insight into like what we can learn the good from him. He says, Geffen had come to be involved with nearly every medium in the entertainment world, and he had been almost invariably successful. He was extremely successful in multiple domains. I'm not trying to downplay his talent whatsoever. I'm just saying that he was extremely ruthless.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

You can't -- I feel when analyzing the life of -- and learning from the life of David Geffen, you can only focus on one aspect. He was driven, talented and ruthless. And the reason I bring this up is because we don't want to be naïve. We live in a very complex and chaotic world. And the people we study, they're imperfect human beings just like you, just like I am. We're all imperfect. Now we don't ever want to go to the level of imperfection that we see -- that we're going to see here today with Geffen, but we have to realize that these people, if you're extremely ruthless and driven, you can also become extremely successful. Now what we want to do is be extremely successful by being really good at what we do and not have that come in at expense of other people. But there's a ton of people. There's a ton of people throughout human history. They're alive today. They were alive 100 years ago, they will be alive in the future. That are just like David Geffen, and we have to realize that these people exist. And again, my advice is to avoid them. So he says, he is successful in almost every medium, right? From humble beginnings in Brooklyn, where he learned entrepreneurial skills from his mother, Geffen, with searing focus, that's a positive, unyielding drive, another positive and outlandish nerve, I would also say a positive, had devised and implemented strategies to propel himself to the top of the heap of Hollywood powerbrokers. And I think one of the mistakes he made was he was competing in what's largely a zero-sum game, where most of life and business can be positive some. Now here's some personality -- these short little sentences that are going to give you the idea of his negatives, extreme negatives. Former executive at Warner Communications told Tom, the author of the book, I used to have phone conversations with David that would leave me sweaty. Stephen J. Ross, who is arguably the most important mentor Geffen ever had. Ross has done a great deal for Geffen, but Geffen did not see it that way.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Geffen had repaid him by making insensitive comments to the press as Ross, lay dying from cancer. A quote from Geffen's only sibling, his brother, "Why would you want to write a book about him? Why don't you write a book about somebody who's done good for the world." So the foreword ends with David Geffen doing what he does throughout his whole life screaming, he's on the phone screaming at Tom. He says, "I changed my mind. I don't want you to write the book." And by that time, it was too late. And it was interesting, Tom's reaction was like, "Oh, good. This is -- I'm glad we're having this fight because now I see how David was with most people in his life, so I can write a more authentic book about him." Okay? All right. So I want to start in the early days. I think to understand David Geffen, you kind of have to understand what I would describe as like the Proto David Geffen, which was his mother. I think her name is spelled Batya or pronounced Batya. So this is Batya Geffen, which, again, I think is David Geffen before David Geffen. Living at -- this is before David is born, living at the poverty line and lacking even the money to buy milk for their baby, the Geffen's went on a relief program. They immigrated. They were from Russia, at least she was from the Ukraine at the time. And they're living in New York City, don't have a lot of money. Okay. So it says, they're living in the poverty line, lacking even the money to buy milk for the baby. This is David's older brother. The Geffen's went on a relief program. But Batya was a proud woman who felt a deep sense of shame when welfare workers visited their apartment. She also married somebody that was not like her, so a description of David's father. There is one thing she now understood fully. The man she married 2 years earlier, he was simply not ambitious. Batya was extremely ambitious. She was embarrassed that she couldn't make any money. She was extremely hard working and very powerful personality. So she starts her own business. And they said there's a lot of like -- they call them, I think heavy -- well, let me just read this part to you.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

She's going to create by hand and eventually manufacture her own line of bras, okay? And it says, the bras she made was a good one and the word of her talent spread quickly. Her world in New York was populated with scores of heavy set immigrant women and Batya sensed that there was a market for inexpensive custom-made brassieres, Facing the most desperate financial situation of her life, she established a small home business. And this business was relatively successful. She kept it for, I don't know, 40 years, a good amount of time. Now this is the person behind the business. Batya moved about the neighborhood with the force of a hurricane, you could easily say that about David as well. She was convinced she was put on the earth to tell people how things ought to be done, whether or not they ask for instructions. You can say that about David as well. She was incapable of seeing life through anyone else's eyes other than her own. Her son also possess that quality. David was her mother's favorite. He was about 10 years younger than his older brother -- and by that time, they were in a way better financial position. They were not rich by any means, but they weren’t on welfare because of Batya's bra business, right? And so she really pumped him up. She gave him like a high -- she told him to have a high, like self-opinion of himself. He says, "Batya held little David's hands and told him that everything they touch would turn to gold." She also hid devastating things from them. So -- this is also -- unfortunately, we have to understand that I always say, in like my own life, like I never want to rely on the good graces of other people, right? I was listening to this podcast the other day, and I had to rewind it because I could not believe what the person was saying. Let me actually hold on. Let me get his quote because I wrote -- put in my notebook because my approach -- my personal approach to life is it's the exact opposite of this person's.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Deena said that most had perished in the September 1941 massacre at Babi Yar, a huge ravine outside of Kiev that served as a mass execution ground during the Nazi occupation. They were ordered to strip naked and were led in groups of 10 to the edge of the ravine where they were systematically machine-gunned from the opposite side. Their half-sisters, their father and mother, their husbands and children were shot on the other site and thrown down by the well and buried essentially in a mass grave. So this idea that it's beautiful to feel very small and very weak and to feel that you need other people is a lie. Now this -- what's interesting to this is she –as expected, think about it like you hadn't talked to your family in 2 decades. This is before, I guess, the only modern technology would be like the telephone for God's sake. So communication was extremely different than the world we live in now, right? And you find this out, what do you expect even a strong woman like Batya? She ends up having a nervous breakdown. She has to go. She spends time in an asylum, is just really heavy stuff in here. Okay. So let's skip ahead. Now she is also an extremely strong person. She recovers. She hides this. David and his brother don't find this out after she dies. Now we're talking maybe 30 or 40 years after the fact. She held the secret for a very long time is what I'm telling you, okay? But the one thing that David benefited of having -- one of the reasons David benefited having her as a mother, she was, in large part, a master entrepreneur. Not in the sense that she could build a -- she was always capable of making enough money to support every member of her family, okay? So it says David might not have realized it, but he was being educated by a master entrepreneur. Batya succeeded in teaching him the value of hard work and the possibilities of life under the most difficult circumstances. She was a brilliant businesswoman who could account for every penny that went into and out of the enterprise.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

She kept her overhead low by driving hard bargains with her suppliers and by closely monitoring her expenses. This is something David would do that was very different from other people in the record business. And it gave him a huge advantage, something that most of the entrepreneurs that we study, say, it's like what's your cost, what's your cost, what's your cost. It's just math at the end of the day. Now here's an interesting part. David found something he loves at a very early age, and this is going to influence the career that he chooses. But we're going to see -- eventually, he runs into a fork in the world or fork in the road rather, where it's like, okay, I can choose the world I love or the one that's giving me money, lots of money and faster. And so he chooses the second road. And I think that is a big takeaway here that if you're doing things for money, money will solve money problems. But David is extremely, extremely unhappy. It's not going to solve your unhappiness problems. We see people that are rich and successful all the time, and they kill themselves because they never figured out how to be content with life. David obviously never committed suicide, but he's largely discontent from the time we meet him as a young adolescent until the book ends -- this book is 20 years old. So I think he's into 70s now. I think the book ends when he's like 57 or something like that, so it says this is David finding something he loves, show business, Broadway movie. So it says, to David, Broadway was a magical wonderland that called to him, a world far away from the life he knew at home. He became obsessed with show business. So he takes the train into -- they're living in Brooklyn to go down to Times Square and you catch all of these, at the time, you can pay like $2, and he'd see a bunch of shows. He just spent all day there. David fantasized that one day the crowd will be cheering for him. We start to see his personality traits at a very young age. At just 13 years old, David displayed a blatant lust for money. He had a weird -- he is like, I'm going to get rich. So let me go look at occupations that are rich. So he's like, "Oh, I'm going to be a dentist." He said dentist he figures were rich, and that was his main goal in life.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This is how his cousin described him. He's enterprising. He thinks of nothing but money. Now here, we're going to see another -- we're going to see his mother constantly tell him, "Listen, you are a special child, you're gifted, you could do anything you want." Now I'm going to read this to you, but this is very similar. This is this – “depending on who the person is, giving this advice to them could make extremely positive impact in their life.” When I read this part, I immediately thought of the advice that Nolan Bushnell gave to young Steve Jobs. So I'll get there in a minute, okay. He says, this is his mom. "You may not be very tall, but you will stand head and shoulders above everyone. If you think of yourself as head and shoulders above everyone else, you will be." She did understand that there is a power in positive thinking and people think it's like willie foo foo stuff. But like I would say, the combination of a positive mental attitude and perseverance can overcome almost any obstacle job in your life. So why I say this is similar to the advice Nolan Bushnell gave to young Steve Jobs because, first of all, if you don't know who Nolan Bushnell is, go back and listen to Founders #36. This guy is one of the craziest creators I've ever heard of. He was the founder of Atari and Chuck E. Cheese. The book that he wrote, which is "Finding the Next Steve Jobs." he wrote that book because he's one of the very few people that was ever a boss to Steve Jobs. He hired like an 18- or 19-year-old Steve Jobs to work at Atari. And that book, Finding the Next Steve Jobs opens up with Nolan's balling out of control. His companies, both Atari and Chuck E. Cheese, at the time were doing more in revenue than Apple. And Apple, I think, was doing like $100 million a year or something at the time. Gigantic successful businesses, so he buys just like huge house at Paris, if I'm remembering correctly, and I haven't read the book in a while, but -- and he throws a party. And Steve Jobs shows up at this party. I think at the time, Steve Jobs was like 25, 26 years old. And then they end up spending the next day or two walking around Paris talking about creativity, building businesses and that discussion is the foundation for the book Nolan writes, and it contains tons of useful information. You can read on like a weekend. I highly, highly recommend it.

But the piece of advice that Nolan gave Steve that Steve really ran with if you've analyzed the career of Steve Jobs, right, is pretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are. He told that to a young Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs took that advice and ran with it, just like David -- or excuse me, Batya is telling a young David Geffen. Think that you're head and shoulders above everybody else and everybody else will start believing that too. Okay. So let's get more insights into his personality. Essentially, David is a misfit that doesn't like himself but with something to prove. And this combination leads to extreme outlier success. He says there was already a lot that David did not find attractive about himself when he looked in the mirror, he was small framed and short, and he had a nose that he thought of was big and ugly. He was also the son of broken down unbalanced parents. And now he detected indications that his sexual orientation was one that many people term Deviants. He grew more insecure and frightened that people would discover who he really was and judge him harshly. So what they're talking about there is David was gay, but he would not -- he didn't admit it till -- I think he was -- he had to be in his 40s by this time. So here's something to understand about David. And this is where I think -- we do not want to follow this example here. He was like 5-foot -- he is 5-foot 7, Jewish. He's got a big nose. He's like scrawny. He wanted to be -- it says in the book, which is jaw-dropping to me. He had dark black hair. He wanted to be 6.1, straight, married, with kids, not a big nose and blue eyes and a gentile. He essentially wanted to be the opposite of what he was. I don't think -- my opinion of this is like your uniqueness, everybody has some kind of like uniqueness about their personality.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And yet, over time, society kind of conditions you to like to limit your uniqueness to become -- conform more like everybody else, I think you should just lean into it. You don't control your hair color, your eye color, your height, what your nose looks like, any of this stuff. And so don't feel the need to change who you are, use the things that make you different as your strength, like in his case, he becomes fabulously financially successful. He's got a lot of people that admire him. He gets to date whoever he wants. Like they don't -- at the end of the day, there's another -- I'm going to reference "Wait But Why" again, that blog by Tim Urban. He's got this great post about, I can't remember the name of it. Let me actually -- let me look for it real quick. So I don't ruin this point. Okay. I found the post. And it's a quick post you can probably read in, I don't know, 15 minutes maybe. It's called, I’ll link it in the show notes too. It's called Taming the Mammoth: Why You Should Stop Caring What Other People Think. And Tim is an obviously great communicator, great writer, but the synopsis of the point he's making is what David Geffen here. He's like, "Oh, people aren't going to like because I'm tall -- I'm short, I'm Jewish and I'm gay. People don't think about other people. You cannot get caught up too much with what other people think about you because they're not thinking about you. Think about your very best friend in the world, how often you think about them on a daily basis? What, a couple of minutes maybe? 20 minutes a day? Who knows? The point is most of the time you're thinking about, "Oh, I'm hungry, I'm tired, I got to work on this, oh, I got to pick up my kid from school, Oh, I got to do this." That's just how people are. We think of ourselves.

This is his teacher, describing him. He's rather talkative, self-centered, ignored teacher's orders and instructions. He is fresh and conceded. The life story of one person can fundamentally change you forever, forever. And that happens with David Geffen. It's happened with a bunch of people. So this is David Geffen finding the biography of Louis B. Mayer, and he holds on to this idea for his entire life. The ideas are such weird special things that can have such a great impact. It says so he moves to Hollywood. David thought he had found paradise. It was more -- even more intoxicating than he had imagined. His life's ambition was soon established after he read a new biography of MGM studio boss, Louis B. Mayer, and this is the takeaway that David had. "I want this job," he thought to himself. Something to know about David Geffen is he did terrible at school. He was not a fan of formal education. In fact, later on in his life, he took that as a source of pride that he was able to succeed further with less education than the people that have a bunch of degrees. So it says from the moment classes began, it was clear that college and David were not meant for each other. Plagued by the same issues that had been set him in high school, he simply did not have the attention span that college required. He was eager to get into the real world and seemed incapable of spending long hours studying in the library. So at this time, he had moved to, I think, Texas to go to college. So he flew back to Los Angeles without completing his first term or taking any final exams. There was to be no further formal education for David Geffen. So he starts to meet people that knew other people that were successful in their business. Remember, he wants to do movies. He hasn't talked about music yet. But he winds up meeting a -- he is the first music mogul, they call him, is this guy named Phil Spector. At the time they're writing this book Phil is a crazy person. We now know Phil Spector was convicted of homicide or manslaughter something like that. He's serving like a 20-year sentence, and he's in like in his 80s right now.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this is -- Spector is extremely violent. He winds up pointing a gun at David too and other people, he was just constantly point guns at people. So we kind of see this. But the noble advice itself on this page is we must learn not to emulate these behaviors. So it says, Spector was the first music mogul David saw in action. And he studied his every move. Spector was only more than -- 2 years older than David, but he was already a millionaire and a star. He was a renowned acentric and most people around him felt it was understatement to call his behavior unbalanced. He was an ego maniac, a control freak, an extremer. You could also say that about David. He realized that Spector achieved his success without either movie star looks or a terrific singing voice. "I could do this," David thought. Okay. So David has a bunch of menial jobs and Hollywood gets fired from a lot. A lot of them, eventually, somebody gives them an idea like why don't you become an agent. And they set him on a path that he didn't intend for himself. And they said, hey, a lot of agents start out in the mail room at William Morris or agencies like that. And so that's what he did. He gets a job. Now here's the deal. He lied about being graduating college and he also lied about being Phil Spector's cousin to get the job. David lies a -- Geffen lies a ton, a ton in this book. But here's -- that's not really my main point here. The point was that if they found out that you lied in your application, you get fired from there. So David devises a plan to avoid that. And then his plan winds up producing unintended positive byproducts. This is a very interesting part. Let me read this to you. He devised the plan. He came in an hour early every day for 4 months and rifle through every one of the bags of mail, hunting for a letter from UCLA that he was certain would arrive that would inform the Morris office that the university had no idea who David Geffen was. Now here's the thing, his -- the President of this company at the time, attributed his early arrivals to ambition. But in truth, it was simply terror.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he winds up ingratiating himself into like the people that are running the business. And he does this his entire life. He has a very -- he uses mentors. -- he can get -- he would flatter older people that are in positions of power, and he’d leverage their relationship to get -- to go where he wanted to go next. And then what happens is that he would burn the bridge, talk c_*_* about them, do things that you shouldn't do for people that are helping you. It says in the sure sign, yet that Geffen's moral compass was off-kilter, he did not believe that he had done anything wrong. So what happens is that the letter comes, and he forges it. He felt he simply exercised his gift for resourcefulness. This was to become the most repeated tale of his career, and he proudly boasted about it throughout his life. So now we're talking about -- we're going to understand more of his personality through the view of the other people working in the mail room with him. Demonstrating an arrogant disregard for their views and welfare of his fellow people, they compare him to this character called Sammy Glick, who is in this really popular novel in the 1940s. It says demonstrating an arrogant disregard for the views and welfare of the fellow people Sammy Glick was a backstabbing huckster who employed appalling tricks to run to the top in Hollywood, kicking others off the ladder as he rose higher and higher. Having tossed aside all notions of right and wrong, young David Geffen simply lived by different rules than did the rest of society around him. Unconstrained by traditional ideas of acceptable social behavior, he was free to use all of the resources at his fingertips to achieve his lofty goals. So obviously, I'm not advising -- like when I read that, I don't want to achieve success through duplicitous means. But we'd be very naive not to realize that there's a ton of people just like David Geffen out there that will do that. And if you happen to have to work with them or you get in their way, there could be disasters, consequences to your life.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So again, let's just practice avoidance. It says, continuing that paragraph, employing his strong -- the strong work ethic he had learned from his mother, Geffen simply worked harder than anyone else. And that is true. He would essentially be working 24/7 nonstop. And then this is in what -- I think we're in the -- was my guess here 60s maybe at this point in the book. And the people that are running the company are going to realize, "Hey, this guy here that is working the mail room does -- first of all, he does any task that we assign him, he does it rapidly. He goes above and beyond, these are the good things about David. He goes above him beyond his job. He will spend more time doing it. He has nothing going on. He's not in school. He has no family. He's like -- there is a very special time in a person's life, in my opinion, of this like early, let's say, after high school, college age, early 20s, where you have -- the only responsibility you really have at that point and for most people, it's like themselves. So anyways my point being is like David, at this point, sorry, David Geffen -- he's got nothing but time. He's got no money and a ton of drive and nothing but time. And when you combine no money with one of the most driven people I have ever come across, and every minute of the day that he's not sleeping dedicated is that, of course, he is going to make progress. Of course, he is. So that's what we're seeing here. Okay. So this is -- now he's also crazy, but he has a lot of smart ideas. And I think this is a smart idea to never settle where you are. So he says, he's in the mail room, but he's using the opportunity in the mail room, he saying I am not stay here, I'm using this as a launch pad. He always used every opportunity as another like ring on the ladder to get to where he wanted to go, right? So he says, his plan, he was only in the mail room for now, but he wanted to make a name for himself signing actors. He saw Broadway plays musical all the time.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so he's like, why don't we do this? Why don't we start your own publishing company? They call it Tuna Fish Music, I think. And when you -- she would -- her albums would do okay, but she made more money by writing songs and then giving them to people like Barbra Streisand and all these other people. And so when another singer used her song, she would constantly make money like on the back end, like on a residual basis, over and over again. And so that's actually how David becomes a millionaire. So I just want to set that up. I'm not there yet, but that's the first way -- the first of many businesses that he's going to sell and the first one that makes him a millionaire. All right. So at this point, he is an agent, but he's also a manager. He's doing both, and he's jumping around from agency to agency because he's signing people. He's having success and he gets recruited. And he's in his early 20s here. So he becomes successful rapidly. It was not long before Geffen grew bored, restless, and unhappy at the Ashley Famous Agency that he was at. Even though he was signing some of the biggest acts in the business, booking concerts was tedious and thankless work, and there's almost so much money to be made. So the question was like, what are you going to do next? Soon, Geffen became obsessed with the brazen idea that he ought to quit the agency and form his own record label and personal management firm. This is exactly what he's going to do. Having studied Clive Davis, he decided that he, too, had the savvy to make it in the record industry. It was not much of a stretch for him to envision David Geffen, the music mogul. So that's a good idea. I think seeing somebody else do something gives you the confidence that maybe you can do it as well. David Geffen sees Clive Davis. He says okay, I know Clive, I can do this as well. Now he doesn't stop there though. One word description of David Geffen has got to be bold. He's definitely bold. He boldly told Clive Davis that he ought to leave his job as President of Columbia Records and become his partner in a new label that they could run as co-CEOs.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He read scripts voraciously and he imagine which actors would break out in which parts. One day, he promised he would represent movie stars and directors. So he starts building this huge it's, I would call it almost like a database of all the actors. There was no IMDb back then, right, about the actors he liked, okay, reading all these scripts he had, going back to what David Ogilvy told us, the good one is just no more. David Geffen knew more. He was willing to do that. And when I read this section it made me think of one of my favorite quotes. It's from Bruce Lee. And it says, it's about not seeing limits, only plateaus, right? So he says, this is Bruce Lee. He says if you always put limits on everything you do, it will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. David, he never -- even he didn't know that Bruce Lee quote, he definitely personified that idea. He -- one thing I took away from him is he did not believe there was a ceiling to what he could accomplish. And as a result, he goes from working in the mail room to eventually accumulating $8 billion or whatever it is. I mean that's why they wrote the book on him. He's a very complex, contentious person. Okay. So this is how David builds a relationship with the President of William Morris. So it reminds me a lot, if you listen to my podcast I did on Aristotle Onassis as Founders #84. He -- Onassis did something like this too, remember, he fled the Greco-Roman war. He winds up as a refugee in Brazil, like 17-year-old kid, he's got to build up from nothing. And he did a similar thing to break into -- Onassis did a similar thing what David is going to do here to break into the tobacco business, reselling tobacco in Brazil, right? Okay? So it says this is the guy that he's trying to target ,is this guy named Lefkowitz.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

After hearing that Lefkowitz came to work on Saturdays, Geffen decided he would too. For weeks, Geffen stalked Lefkowitz. It's exactly what Onassis did. He would follow the guy that made the decision about where to buy tobacco and he just waited until he noticed him. So Geffen stalked Lefkowitz until one Saturday, the two stood together waiting for the elevator. Geffen introduced himself and struck up a conversation. Lefkowitz impressed with his display of unbridled ambition, asked if he would join him for lunch. Lefkowitz liked Geffen. He was impressed by both his doggedness and his appropriately reverential manner, he would kiss his a** essentially what he was saying there. The other young man in the mail room was stunned to find that Geffen was not lying when he said he had formed a relationship with the President. Geffen has a talent that I definitely don't possess and a talent that took him very far in his career. And that's his ability to forge what people think are authentic relationships with a large, large number of people. Unfortunately, the further you get in the book, you realize, "Oh, this is the opposite of authentic." It was like very transactional, which I'm not a big fan of transactional relationships. Okay. So he's got this whole idea. He's like, I'm going to be a -- I want to be Louis B. Mayer, that's me. But some -- he meets somebody. This guy named Brandt, and Brandt changes the path of David's life again. And because David -- he informs David Geffen that "Listen, Geffen, you're on the slow path here." So he gets advice how to speed things up and he does. Remember he's been lusting after money since he was 13. After listening to Brandt, Geffen explained that he planned to rocket to the agency's top echelon by signing movie stars and directors. Brandt looked at the scrawny kid and laughed. "Listen, jerk, you're 22 years old," Brandt told him, what do you think a famous director is going to sign with you?" The music department, he said, was the place where a young agent could make a name for himself.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Brandt's advice had a profound impact on Geffen. He at once rejiggered his career plans. So Brandt did make a bunch of money in the music business. And he is saying, "Listen, that's nice that you want to work in the movies, but young people don't -- they're not -- the agents are not going to sign with a 22-year-old, are you crazy?" And so he's like, "For you, music is going to be more lucrative." So David's takeaway was, it was not an undying passion for music that made him decide to try to make his fortune in the business; he did it because he might get rich quickly. And I think that is also the issue with David. Before I paid for the book, I knew the name David Geffen, I heard Geffen Records. I didn't know any detail really beyond that. I didn't even know -- all I knew that he founded DreamWorks with Spielberg and Katzenberg, right, which I'll get to also in a little bit. But yes, I was surprised when he had such an undying passion and focus on movies because he never seemed to really do much of movies. It was all music. And so he winds up selling multiple record labels. The last one, he sells for $550 million. It makes him fabulously wealthy, but he's spending time doing things he just doesn't like to do. So take whatever lesson you think is there. One thing Geffen realized early, and I think a lot of artists are starting to understand this folly now, Geffen wanted to stay close to the money. So he's in the music business now and he's like, how do these records make money? It says, early on, Geffen recognized that publishing was one of the areas in the music business where the real money was being made. So he's going to stay close to that money. We talked about this all the time. Long after an artist star had faded, publishers benefit financially for years to come, pocketing royalties whenever a group records a song or a sheet of music is sold.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I think there's a lot of parallels between entrepreneurship -- modern-day entrepreneurship now and this phenomenon, this trend that you're seeing in the music industry where artists are realizing, "Hey, I'm the one making the goods, I'm the one making the music, I should own it." So a ton of people, David Geffen being one of them in history, got extremely rich, essentially owning the work of other people. And now with technology, it's like, well, I'm going to keep my -- they're called masters. I'm going to keep -- it's the publishing rights to your music. That's where they make so much money. So these musicians are smartly realizing, "Hey, I need to -- I don't really need to give away all my work and make this old dude rich." They didn't necessarily know that back when Geffen was getting it started. And I think the parallel there is there's a lot of people realizing, "Hey, in your business, equity is your most valuable thing. So be very careful about selling portions of it especially if your business is growing. The analogy there is like equity is to -- ownership is to the entrepreneur what the publishing rights is to the musician. And I think if independent entrepreneurs study what independent musicians are doing, and they're making a lot of -- and some of these people are young kids. I've been listening to a lot of interviews and stuff and they're extremely adept and understood the pitfalls of the previous generation and are avoiding that masterfully. And as a result, making the music they want to make and making all the money, which, again, it's just entrepreneurship and I'm here for that. I love that. Okay. So what he does here, the reason I bring this stuff for Geffen is he starts -- he's an agent, but then he never does just one thing. So he signs musicians. And one of the first artist he signs, she is a singer and songwriter, but that's now where David is going to make his money. So he goes through, listen I'm going to -- and usually at this time agents would like book tours, that's how they make money, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

That's definitely bold. And what's even crazier is Clive thought about it for a little bit. He didn't obviously wind up doing it, but that's wild. All right. So this is -- now we get to the part where David becomes a millionaire. Geffen went to Clive Davis with an offer to sell Tuna Fish Music to CBS. He was praying for a windfall and wanted to strike while the iron is hot. Tuna Fish Music had already earned over $0.5 million, and Davis knew it automatically continue to earn substantial income as an annuity for pass copyrights. That's what I mentioned earlier, some people in the music business have become incredibly rich off that idea. They want to make him a deal worth more than $3 million. It was a staggering amount of money, the likes of which had really been applied to the value of any solo artist catalog of songs. Now the reason I bring that up is because it's really important, what seems -- this happens a lot in life like, "Oh my God, the company got bought for x amount." And sometimes it's the beginning of a trend where the valuation is just going to keep increasing in the future. This is happening in the music business at this time. They're like, "Oh, my God, I can't leave Clive spent $3 million on a single solo artist catalog, right?” Well, this trend continues into the future, and it helps David sell his record label maybe, I don't know, 10, 15 years in the future, I'm not exactly sure of the time frame for hundreds of millions of dollars, one that is being $550 million, the stock winds up going. I think before he sells it to like $650 million. So an unbelievable amount, way more than $3 million. It says Geffen was riding high, yet he remained unsettled and plagued by feelings of insecurity and dissatisfaction. We see this over and over again. People are thinking that, "Hey, whatever is wrong with me can be solved by money. Money solves money problems. But if you're deeply unhappy, you have issues that you haven't rectified, if you're spending your time doing things you don't like to do, if you have bad relationships, like money is not going to solve that problem." I think of -- one of my favorite people I used to learn a lot from, I read his books, I watched his show, Anthony Bourdain, for many people traveling around the world, eating great food, filming a TV show about it.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It seems like the best job in the world. I think Dave Chappelle opened his last special, what was it called? Sticks & Stones maybe with this very same point. Like most people look at Anthony Bourdain, he has the best job in the world, and he killed himself. And so David was using that point, it's like, "Hey, my life is good, but it's not great." I think he uses the analogy, it's like "My life is like an above-ground pool." It's a pool, but he's basically saying, "Hey, I know it looks like I'm Dave Chappelle, I'm traveling around and getting paid $20 million for every dinner special, but I also have problems too, problems that my money is not solving." So I think that's just important to know and understand that's perfectly normal for having his feelings and just try to solve them. He was driven by the devil that constantly told him he needed to be bigger, more, and something else. He simply was not the kind of man who was going to be -- who was going to stand in one place for very long. He decided suddenly that now is the right moment to turn his attention to filling the fantasy he had since reading the biography of Louis B. Mayer. This book is mentioned like half a dozen, maybe a dozen times in this book. It's very important to him. He wanted to be a power broker in the movie business. He said, "Oh, I got a little bit of money, let me try to do that." Now obviously, listen, this book is 600 pages long. It is gigantic. So this is not -- as every podcast I make, this is not meant to be a summary. I'm just pulling out the interesting ideas that I thought -- found for myself. And if you think the podcast is interesting, then obviously, I always recommend buying the book. So I'm going to skip over a bunch of stuff, but I want to really hone in on David, the person. And this is about his imposter syndrome that comes up a lot in the book, and his nasty habit of screaming at people, which is a very unwise decision. He winds up getting into many, many physical altercations. This is just not a smart way to live your life. Geffen had realized that his most powerful weapon was his voice. He was a gifted screamer. And he learned quickly that he could scare people into giving him what he wanted. His rage was so formidable that it left some of his victims gasping for air.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Is that really how you want to live your life? Screaming at people, having miserable relationships? This is not good. The irony that was -- for Geffen was most likely more frightened than his victims. While he saw himself most of the time as the smart, fast-rising star he had become, there seemed to be fleeting, dreadful moments when his confidence shattered, and he was gripped with fear. In these moments, he saw himself as a shadow of his father, the failure who had never gained respect. Geffen built up an enormous wall around himself, most likely praying that others would not also see that shadow. Now he has still has not -- at this point in the story, he has still not broken into the movie business. I'll get there in a minute. But this is a turning point in David's life, and I think is very important. He has not started his own record label yet, okay? And he is visiting Clive Davis and he's trying to get Clive to sign this artist, I think his name is like Jackson Browne or something like that. And they're in a meeting and Davis has to interrupt the meeting because he was getting a phone call. And David Geffen thought Clive Davis is being extremely rude. So he's like, let's -- we're getting out of here. So Geffen on the other hand, was in a sense that what he thought was Davis's rude behavior. "Pack up your guitar, we're leaving," he told Browne. Browne dutifully put his guitar and followed Geffen out of the office and past the -- where Davis was talking on the phone. "Wait," Davis shouted after them, but Geffen had already reached the elevator. Geffen's next stop changed the course of his life. He turned to Ahmet Ertegun and asked him to sign Browne to a contract at Atlantic. "Ahmet, look, I'm trying to -- Ahmet is another mentor of David. "Ahmet, look, I'm trying to do you a favor by giving you Jackson Browne," David Geffen said, delivering a passionate pitch. "You'll make a lot of money." You know what, David, "I have a lot of money," Ahmet replied. "Why don't you start a record company and then you'll have a lot of money, too." It was exactly what Geffen wanted to hear. His eyes lit up as Ahmet further offered to be his partner in exchange for a 50% ownership interest in the new label, Ahmet volunteered -- he's running Atlantic Records at that time.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Atlantic would cover all the expenses as well as handle the manufacture, distribution and promotion of Geffen Records. The cost would be charged equally against the joint venture and any profits will be split equally between Atlantic and Geffen. It was an astonishing deal that would not cost Geffen a cent. He realized without hesitation that now is the moment to realize this dream. If no one else would sign Jackson Browne, he figured, he would do it himself, "Yes," he told Ahmet, "count me in." Now this is David's strategy of running his company. The way Geffen saw it is this is another smart move. The way Geffen saw it, there was a natural synergy in owning both a record company and a management company. Remember, they made money in two different ways, record company of publishing, management company of touring. They could use the management company to book and promote the acts. It was recording on the label and vice versa, controlling both sides of the business, okay? That's a good -- it's a really smart move. But why -- what's the real advantage? Geffen explained that they could use the record deal, which can complete with Atlantic financing, to cover the overhead at the management company. He understood that if you watch your costs, you make more money. That's why so many entrepreneurs give us that advice. So this is the thing that Geffen like most about the offices was the reasonable rent. From the day he opened his new business, Geffen had an eye fixed on the bottom line. He had the foresight to avoid the pitfalls that have proved fatal to so many others who had launched record labels before him. So he's also doing something smart, watching his cost and studying the people that did what he's trying to do before him, and realizing the good ideas they had and "Oh, they all went broke, they all spent too much money. Let me avoid that." He calls it being -- that was fatal -- and indeed, it was fatal. He was overhead averse and did not feel the urge to redecorate or to hire a large staff. For all of his money, David Geffen was turning out to be rather frugal. He well understood the delicate balance between profit and loss can be upset if expenses are high.

Here's one sentence that describes David Geffen's MO. Playing fair, Geffen had learned, was difficult and time-consuming. Lying, on the other hand, was easy and effective. You got to be very careful when you get around people like this. Okay. So this is the part where I realize, oh, I think this guy is a sociopath. And the question I left myself is like, is this the way you want to live your life? Even the mere sight of him, meaning Geffen sometimes prompted violent reactions. Remember, humans, the lowest common denominator in our conflict resolution in our species that has been very well documented is not words. When words fail, we inevitably go to violence. And this is why you don't want to be a jerk. You don't want to be -- I see people online, just like send nasty messages to people they don't know, just the way they talk about people. It's very, very unwise, very unwise. You don't want to go around creating enemies. I don't understand why you're doing that. And even that if you have a disagreement, try to remain calm, David would throw things at people, he would curse at them, yell at them. The problem is people can hit back and they do. He had guns pointed at him. He gets hit with eggs. He gets punched multiple times. Is that really you want your life to be? It's so silly. It doesn't have to be. Even the mere sight of him sometimes prompted violent reactions, someone driving by pelted Geffen with eggs, friends pulled -- I'm going to skip over -- going to give you a bunch of highlights of different violent interactions he has had. Friends pulled the two apart just before it was likely to escalate into fistfight. He got to -- Jerry Heller got into a screaming match with Geffen. The two shouted obscenities at each other from their respective windows. They had offices next to each other. There were countless murky situations in which Geffen himself was at least partly to blame for his contentious relations with other people. He got punched multiple times, and he punched people multiple times. Now here is where you realize that sociopaths sleep well, they don't think anything is wrong with their behavior. My own personal view on this is the opposite. David would get into -- let me read this you and I'll tell you a book that heavily influenced my thinking on this. There were countless murky situations in which Geffen himself was at least partly to blame for his contentious relationship with people in the business. But Geffen conscious always remained clear. A quote from him, "I don't have the burden of bulls**_*_** lies, and deceit and cheating none of that plagues me because I don't do any of it" what?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He does that almost every day. What is he talking about? I think I'm unique in this business. I can sleep at night, you got to run the other direction if you ever get around people like this. Literally, they sleep well because they don't think anything is wrong with their behavior. So any time something would happen, David would blame other people. If a record didn’t sell, if this deal didn't go through, it was never ever his fault, ever. It was your fault, you're an idiot. I'm great. I've read this book a few years ago, it's called Extreme Ownership. It's the exact opposite of this. It's saying, "Hey, no matter what happens in your life assume that you're the one responsible and try to do everything you can to fix it. Like that's a brief explanation of the general idea. And so that example is like, okay, let's say you're running a company and your subordinate, one of your employees gives poor customer service or makes mistakes. Okay, yet, most people like, oh, you're an idiot. In some cases, that is true, and you have to fire the person where the case is. But in this book, it's like, okay, I am at fault here because I'm the leader, I'm the one in charge. I clearly did not communicate, one, I mean, I was the one who made the mistake, maybe one, I hired the wrong person, or two, maybe I didn't communicate the level of service that this company does. And that flips everything around completely because it goes from being helpless to realizing, hey, I have agency over the -- a lot of situations in my life. And the ones I don't have agency over, I'm not going to worry about because they're beyond my control. But everything else, I'm going to say, okay, I may -- clearly made a mistake and I'm going to learn from this, I'm going to fix it. And I think that's a much more powerful operating system for life than Geffen where it's like, "Oh, everything went good?" That was me. There was a mistake, it must be you that you're an idiot. Okay. So this is -- the record label he starts is the first one. This is not Geffen Records. This is not his big one that he sells for $550 million. This is called Asylum. After a year, he sells as a business and he agrees to an employment contract. And I put -- he agrees there's employment contract question mark, like this does not seem -- David -- it didn't like having partners, didn't like being told what to do. Why would you assign him an employment contract? Well, he had to because he's going to get some money out of it. Although Geffen's goal from the beginning was to one day sell Asylum and reap out cash windfall, he was taken off guard by Ross' offer. Geffen did not contemplate for 1 second declining Ross' offer, he had -- because he had an insatiable hunger for money. He was also motivated by the fear that Asylum's fast rise had been a fluke and it could fall apart at any moment. You can have it for $7 million Geffen blurted out, without blinking Ross agreed to Geffen's price. But then he says you have to sign this employment contract, they wind up having a falling out.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Eventually, he's going to start into – he is going to work in the movie business that -- because Warner has not only music, but in movies. And then he's going to get fired after 11 months. I'm going to talk about that in a minute. And then he spends years essentially doing nothing because he's got this employment contract where he is getting paid all this money to not go to work. So Warner made a mistake. But now we find David Geffen at 30 years old, rich, and depressed. Just 30, he claimed that his net worth was about $12 million. But he was surprised to realize that the millions of dollars he had just banked and the trapping he had been able to acquire with it did not make him happy. It hit him when he was in London on a business trip lying in bed on a posh hotel, smoking a joint and staring at the ceiling. All of his life, he dreamed of being a multimillionaire, thinking that money would solve his problems. It had not and he fell into a deep depression. And I just want to draw your attention to a meeting. So David Geffen becomes friends with and makes a relationship with the Barry Diller, at a time Barry Diller is the Head of Paramount, the movie studio. So they're traveling. And this is where he's going to meet -- David Geffen is going to meet Barry Diller's assistant Jeffrey Katzenberg, I bring this up because Jeffrey Katzenberg winds up being in the future, David's business partner.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, at the airport in New York, Geffen and Diller were met at customs by Jeffrey Katzenberg, a 24-year-old New Yorker who that year had been hired as Diller's assistant at Paramount. Among his jobs was expediting the Chairman's customs check at airports. So he didn't want to wait long to get to customs, right? Geffen, who had wasted many hours in customs was flabbergasted as Katzenberg's oiling of the customs workers enabled him and Diller to breeze through the process. Katzenberg was 8 years his junior, but Geffen saw immediately that Katzenberg had hustler like qualities that he himself had displayed at that early age. So at this point in Geffen's life, he finally gets to do what he wants to do. He's kind of like being groomed to eventually to take over Warner Bros. studio. This is where he's learning the movie business and realizing him and the movie business are not compatible. So he winds up seeing a rough cut of this movie that Clint Eastwood is making, it's called The Outlaw Josey Wales. And so now he goes to have a conversation with Clint Eastwood, and it's going to be kind of a snack in the face. Clint, this is the best picture you've ever done, Geffen said. I only want to suggest one thing. I think it would be better if it was 20 minutes shorter. I'm glad you took the time to see the picture, and I appreciate your comments, Eastwood said calmly. Why don't you study the picture some more and see if you have any more thoughts? When you do, give me a call over at Paramount, remember he is making movies at Warner Bros.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he says, "Why are we at Paramount?" Geffen asks. Because that's where I'll be making my next movie, Eastwood threatened, realizing that you put his foot in his mouth, Geffen quickly recanted, Clint, this picture is perfect. He said quickly. I wouldn't change one frame. Thank you very much. He dashed back out of his office. The exchange was an ominous sign because it showed that Geffen was not versed in the old studio games where producers and executives like lie to one another about how much they love each other's movies. While in another venue, Geffen’s curt style might have been refreshing and Hollywood have played poorly. So I think it's important that you know your strengths and you're in an industry working in an environment and industry a company where those strengths are actually assets. In the music business, he could go around and say, this is a terrible record. We're not going to put it out. They could be kind of brutally honest. The movie business was not like that at all, and it moved a lot slower. Geffen was very hyper, I don't know what word to use there. He's just -- he woke up and he went and then he fell asleep and woke up and went. He was very impatient. So he only lasts 11 months at Warner Bros. And the note of myself is, be careful what you wish for, you might get it. Geffen who has succeeded stellar at everything he had taken on so far in his professional life, now finds himself failing for the first time. He was just getting to realize that he had critically misjudged the cultural differences between the music industry and Hollywood, and that those differences were causing him to stumble badly. Now, this is also you can kind of feel sorry for him because he excelled in an industry he didn't care. He didn't really have a love for music at all. He would listen like show tunes and stuff. And yet he was wildly successful in that domain, and yet the one he loved, he was passionate about, he failed out. So you do feel for him there.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Used to this relatively quick turnaround of record production, some of the records that -- most famous records he ever put out for like the Eagles, he signs, John Lennon and Yoko Ono. I mean he signed Aerosmith, he signs a bunch of big bands. They would have a classic album that would be listened to decades later that they could make in like 10 days. It's not how the movies went. So he was used to relatively quick turnaround. The slow-moving nature of the movie business made him agitated, nervous, and bored. Key to his recipe of success had been his ability to move quickly. But in the movie business, the same pacing proved to be a detriment and it began to drive him crazy. So at this point, after he gets fired from Warner Bros., he does his long sabbatical where they won't let him out of his contract, so he's still getting paid, but he doesn't have to do any work. Eventually, he gets pulled like there's a huge, let's say, economic growth in the record business. So there's a lot of people that want to partner with him because he had such success running independent labels. This is where he starts Geffen. But he's only going to go --this is -- David -- he's a masterful deal maker. This is not a skill I possess. So I do admire like his shrewdness in this, right? He's dealing with complicated large organizations and the people within them, and he can move them around on the -- like a chessboard beautifully. Obviously, some of his tactics were distasteful, but he was very effective. And so this is another example of that. He's getting pulled back in the music business. He doesn't want to go to music business. He still wants to be Louis B. Mayer. So he's like, "I'm going to go back in the music business but only on my terms.” So he's got Mo Ostin, who, along with Steve and Ross, is the Head of Warner and Warner is like becoming this huge media conglomerate, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And eventually, he's going to turn on Mo, but that happens later. But Geffen told Mo Ostin that he would not content to simply run a label in part because he feels like Warner Bros, he wanted more than ever to prove himself a worthy producer of motion pictures. Geffen told Ostin that he would make a record deal if Warner also agreed to bankroll him in movie and theater ventures. This is a very unique -- remember when I started the podcast talking about -- he understood what Steve Jobs did with his life is valuable. Geffen is like I'm going to make my own deal. You're going to fund my -- if you want my music business, you have to fund my movie and Broadway pictures too -- Broadway, I guess, theater. So it says you had to bankroll my movie theater ventures. Geffen had 3 years to stew about his first crack at the entertainment business, analyzing what he did well and figuring out the areas where he wanted to succeed. Now in a brilliant piece of handy work, he cut himself one of the broadest deals in Hollywood. And then while he's doing this, he does something that every other founder that we studied does as well. They cap their downside. This is so important in life, cap your downside, leave your upside unlimited. Warner put up all the money but split any profits 50-50 with Geffen, oh my goodness. For Geffen, who said his own network had now grown to $30 million, there was 0 downside. If the plays in musical see pick or losers, Warner would shoulder 100% of the losses. It's so perplexing that large corporations allow like they take on the -- like they're on the wrong side of this transaction just because they hope that in the future, they're going to get a tiny percentage of the upside. It's really interesting. Okay. So I'm going to skip over giant parts now. And we're going to get to the part where he's got to do -- that's Geffen Records that he just set up, right? Now Warner put up millions and millions of dollars for it. The part I'm going to tell you right now is how he gets them to give them -- he gets Warner to give him -- the 50% of Geffen Records that he does not own for free. Then he goes and turns and sells it to another company for $550 million. This is -- I don't even know how that's possible. And the tricks he uses are really dirty. Okay. So it says, it was to be the most important negotiation of Geffen's life, and he successfully extracted an extraordinary deal that within a few years helped make him one of the wealthiest men in the country. In pulling off the deal, he showed himself to be a shrewd remarkably focused strategist. That's definitely true. He had an uncanny ability to understand people, true, recognize their weaknesses, yes, and capitalize them, yes. The negotiation also showed once again that Geffen had the rare ability to envision success. He clearly understood his power and knew how to get what he wanted. His strongest asset is himself, and he knew that. So I do -- I think that's a smart move. But the negotiation also showed David Geffen at his worse as a man willing to implode any business or personal relationship to attain his goal. Geffen's technique was preposterous, duplicitous, and downright awful. So there's two main decision-makers at Warner, Mo Ostin, who I just told you about, and Stephen Ross. He thought Ross, he had more advantage with Ross. So he intentionally destroys his relationship with Ostin, he starts going -- and these are people that have helped him right, greatly. Talks about that Mo is a liar, he's a cheat, damaged his relationship. He has -- David has a friendship with Mo's wife, and he intentionally takes Mo's wife out to dinner and tells her like your husband doesn't love you, you're ugly, like just terrible things, and intentionally ruins his relationship with his wife because he knows his wife would go back and tell Mo all the things he said and then ruin the relationship with Mo.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

That way, when it's time to negotiate, the only person left standing is Stephen Ross, and Ross is going to give him what he wants. So there's -- book goes on multiple pages of all this like duplicitous behavior. I'm going to skip to the part where David's crazy plan worked. Steve Ross had done Geffen the favor of setting him up in a business with very handsome terms at a time when the industry had branded him a failure. Now Geffen was repaying him by demanding ownership of the venture into which Ross has sunk millions. Geffen would be free to sell the label without having to give Warner a dime. Frightened that Geffen might cause a public stink of both of his demands are vetoed, Ross, as Geffen had predicted, agreed to relinquish the equity stake. So his crazy plan worked. He now owns Geffen 100%. I just want to bring you another point. This is interesting to me on two things. One, because this is his future, David Geffen's future business partner that he is talking about; and two, David Geffen also has all of these traits, which again, goes to the point where people really can't think about themselves or anybody but themselves. He went on a tirade bad-mouthing Steven Spielberg to anyone who would listen. He's selfish, self-centered, egomaniacal, and worst of all greedy, so are you -- that's -- it's crazy. Obviously, Spielberg, Katzenberg, and Geffen get together and they start DreamWorks. And so now we're back to the other side of David.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He was an extremely gifted entrepreneur. He just was. This is a really surprising part of the book. In a surprising twist, David Geffen saves Calvin Klein from bankruptcy. So it says they become friends and eventually David discovers that Calvin Klein, which is a private company at the time, was almost going out of business. So it says, in 1991, there was one thing Calvin Klein did not tell Geffen. His privately held Fashion Empire was on a brink of bankruptcy. So winds up, this comes out and David is like, "I'm going to help you." And this is the other side of his. He could be extremely ruthless, but he also was very helpful, and he did wind up saving Calvin Klein. So they have this discussion, like how much money do you have, he is like I'm not sure, and he is like, well it is your company, you need to know, like, call your CFO, you need to get on this right away. Calvin was -- he was not involved in the intricacies, the details of his business as a result is on the precipice of failure. And so Geffen steps in and starts just running it. He said, Geffen surmises the company should be transformed from a manufacturing firm to a design, marketing, and licensing company. You guys stink at manufacturing, he said, "You need to get out of that business.” Instead. And this is where they had a lot of debt because they wanted to be manufacturers. Instead, Geffen continued the company need -- he just got a lot of good ideas. Instead, Geffen continued the company needed to focus on what it really knew, how to design and market the Calvin Klein brand name. So this is where David Geffen is gifted. He knew what he was best at, and he went all in on that. And that's another takeaway from reading all the biographies is like these people don't succeed because they're perfect. The inspiring part is they succeed in spite of their imperfections, and you can too. All right.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And this is where we're going to see this where he's like, okay, I have clearly identified well you're strong at. You don't even know what you're strong at ,you need to lean into what you're strong at. So focus on what you really know, how to design and market the Calvin Klein brand name. Calvin, you should only be focusing on aesthetics, Geffen said, you should be designing the close and overseeing the marketing and advertising. Geffen reprimanded Klein and this other guy who is working with them for excesses they could not afford. Among other things, he told them to sell the company Jet, which cost them $2.5 million a year to maintain. He also took Klein to fire his Chief Financial Officer. Chief Financial Officer should have warned you, should have known the finance of the business before it got out of hand. Here was the fixer in action. David Geffen was now involved in the kind of problem-solving that energized him more than anything else. He then made an extraordinary offer to purchase all of the company's outstanding junk bond debt, remember it is early '90s, it's extremely common practice led by Michael Milligan. So Calvin Klein had a $62 million of junk bond debt and David is going to buy it up for him. He made ensuring offer to purchase all the company's outstanding junk bond debt, which had a face value of $62 million. The company did not even have enough money to cover its next payment -- debt payment of $15 million. But Geffen said he would cover the entire bill, so they would have some breathing room. And then he goes -- David buys the debt and then goes and leverages his relationship with people in other investment banks and winds up getting it like written down to some degree. And the company needed to turn around. And that is the positive. One of the positives of David is that he could be extremely generous. That's why I said I was really confused when I sat down to start this because he's all of these things.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He's not just -- he's also ruthless but generous, kind, and extremely mean gifted entrepreneurial, and then ruthless to like his employees. It just -- he is very complex. This book shows you like the whole, like the total picture, let me just say that, of Geffen. And I think Geffen made a mistake, though, where, one, if you're going to -- like you authorized the biography and then changes the mind and then decides even though it was too late to change his mind and then treats the person that's going to write the biography poorly. So this book is a fascinating book, especially like you hear about all kinds of behind the scenes of making records that are famous for decades, they've been well known and movies. And you see these like machinations that happen behind the scenes. But I would say going into it, what's the chance that I think about if you were hired to write a book about somebody and then that person treats you really poorly? Like we have to know that there's going to be some emphasis. It's only natural. It's only human to -- it's going to be colored that way. So what I'm trying to do is really pull out, yes, he was extremely so live, so extremely full of person on an interpersonal level, but he's also extremely gifted at what he chose to do. And yet you could be gifted at what you choose to do. And if you choose the wrong path, the path that you don't really want to be on and you're doing just for money, you probably won't be happy. A lot of lessons here. All right. So I'm going to close on this. This is David Geffen's assessment of David Geffen the entire history of his life, since he was early young man he would constantly be trying to work out his mental demons, and so he sees a psychiatrist weekly, I think for his whole life. And he got a lot of insights into who he was as a person.

I've been working on myself and my demons and my nonsense and my f*** upness for a long time, which is not to say that I'm still not a little f*** up. I think you get better and better in tiny increments, and you die unhealed. So I'll leave the story there.

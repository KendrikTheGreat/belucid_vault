Okay. So the book that I'm going to talk to you about today is Insanely Simple: The Obsession That Drives Apple's Success, and it's written by Ken Segall. This book is a little different from the books that you and I normally talk about. It is not a biography, but it is a fascinating look into how it was working with Steve Jobs because Ken Segall was the ad agency creative director of the firm that Steve used when he was at NeXT and then when he came back to Apple to lead that turnaround. And so at this point, I've made, I don't know, 10 episodes on Steve Jobs. I've read as many books on him as I can find. And yet there were stories in this book that I have found nowhere else. And it's because Ken worked with Steve intimately for over a decade. Steve had no problem calling Ken at midnight to debate a single word in the ad copy. And so one of the things that Ken noticed that was different from the other clients that he had was that Steve's dedication to simplicity was almost religious in nature. And you would see that religious like dedication to simplicity throughout the entire way that Steve ran his business to the way he communicated internally with his employees, to the way he communicated externally to his potential customers, to how he organized his team, to how he's built his products. And so Ken noticed that Steve had a tool to do this, and he calls it the Simple Stick, which is one of my favorite stories. This is the second or third time that I've read the book, and it's considering I reread my highlights all time. It's like the 10th time I read the book. And for some reason, I failed to make an episode on it before, so I'm rectifying that mistake here. But the Simple Stick, the reason I bring that up is because from the very first time I read the book, probably 8 years ago, something like that, this idea of the Simple Stick always stuck in my mind. So the Simple Stick is just a tool that Steve Jobs used to keep his team from overcomplicating things. If an idea was not distilled down to its essence, Steve would reject it. If an idea took a turn when it should have traveled in a straight line, Steve would reject it. So an example that comes up over and over again in the book is if you made 2 different versions of anything, Steve would hit you with the Simple Stick until you simplified it down to one.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

There was an ad made many decades ago for the Macintosh, and it said -- the tagline on the ad was describing the Macintosh, and it said that it was simply amazing and amazingly simple. Steve wanted Apple to make products that were simply amazing and amazingly simple, and the Simple Stick was the tool that he used to make that happen. And so the main thesis behind this entire book, and why I want to talk to you about it, is that people prefer simplicity, customers respond to it, yet humans naturally overcomplicate things. True simplicity that is applied consistently throughout your entire organization is extremely rare. Just think about every single business that you ever interact with. Most of the businesses, the products and services that we use, that we buy would not be described as a product of clear thinking and simplicity. Keep in mind the timeframe that we're talking about. We're talking -- most of the book is about the time where Steve comes back to Apple. Apple is losing money. Their product line sucks. They either had to turn it around or die. So I think one of the things that Steve realized, and a lot of other history's greatest entrepreneurs realize the simplicity actually helps you scale. And so when I was reading this part of the book, I thought about Sam Walton. When I read, I read his autobiography multiple times, the last time I made an episode on it was episode 234, but he has a line in that book where he says, "If you don't zero in on bureaucracy every so often, you will naturally build in layers. You never set out to add bureaucracy, you get it, period, without even knowing so. You always have to be looking to eliminate it". The Simple Stick was how Steve eliminated at its source. There's a great line in Sam Walton's autobiography, that's by a Walmart executive. And it's a story about how Sam is trying to use the Simple Stick. He's constantly questioning. And let me just read this too. It says, "I'll give you an example that drove Sam crazy until we started doing something about it. When merchandise came into the back of a store, it was supposed to be marked at the right price and marked correctly on the spot. But because it often wasn't getting done properly, we created positions called test scanners, people who go around the stores with handheld scanners, making sure everything is priced correctly. There's another layer right there, and Sam didn't ever visit a store without asking if we really needed these folks".

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I think that story is a great example that humans naturally overcomplicate things, and it's the leader's job, the constant question, do we actually need this additional layer. The more layers you have, the harder it is to scale. So the Simple Stick is the tool, I want to go into detail on how Steve did this with. Clear Communication The first thing I think is probably the most important is the way he communicated. I've told you in the past, I think he's the clearest thinker, the clearest communicator of every single person I've read about. And so Steve believed that blunt communication was effective, direct communication is extremely simple. So in every single book that I've ever read about Steve Jobs, the people that worked with him all say the exact same thing, he was very easy to understand. If he thought something was great. He's going to tell you. If he thought your work was s_*_ -- that's one of his favorite words to describe poor work, if he thought your work was s**_, he's going to tell you, in fact, the first meeting that Steve Jobs had with the author, Ken Segall, right? Steve goes out to him. He's like, your TV work is great, and can say, great, and he goes, but your print work is s_**. The reason this is important because if somebody is that direct with you, you know immediately what you need to do, can knew immediately what he needed to do. "Oh, okay, if I want to keep Steve as a client, my print work has to improve right now". Employees like all other people respond to clear communication. There's a book that I've read multiple times. I think I've done 2 podcasts on it. Maybe the last time I did the podcast on it was Episode 281, that episode is called Working With Steve Jobs. It is about this book called Creative Selection, which is written by Ken Kocienda. Ken was a programmer who demoed multiple times and worked closely with Steve Jobs. I want to read this section from Ken's book that is so excellent. And if you haven't listened to Episode 281, listen to it after you get done with this one. And so he's describing how clear Steve's communication was to his employees, and this is what Ken says, "Steve was at the center of all circles. He made all of the important product decisions", that's hilarious because the amount of detail in what he's paying attention to, that I'll get to in this book, is exactly what Ken Kocienda is saying here.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"He made all the important product decisions. From my standpoint, as an individual programmer, demoing to Steve was like visiting the Oracle of Delphi. The demo was my question, and Steve's response was the answer. While the pronouncements from the Greek Oracle often came in the form of confusing riddles, this was not true with Steve". Listen to this line, I had -- I double-underlined it, highlighted it, it's so important. He was always easy to understand. He would either approve a demo or he would request to see something different next time. Whenever Steve reviewed a demo, he would say, often with highly detailed specificity what he wanted to happen next. He was always trying to ensure that the products were as intuitive and straightforward, in other words, for simple, right, as possible. And he was willing to invest his own time, effort and influence to see that they were. In that example, Steve is doing that with his employee when he's saying to Ken, hey, your TV work is great. Your print stuff is s_*_. It needs to get better. He's doing the exact same thing with one of his vendors. Being blunt, being direct is the most simple form of communication. And I think one of the most important byproducts of this is that with clear communication, with the blunt communication that Steve used, everybody understood the standards that he insisted they upheld. So there's this great video, I'll link it down below. And this guy named Andy Miller. It's -- I've watched this video, I don't know, 50 times. He sold his company to Apple for $275 million, and then, he moved the entire company from Boston to Cupertino, and he worked with Steve Jobs. And he's describing this byproduct of the clear communication that Steve had with him and everybody else around him. And Andy said that you are aware of the consequences if you screw up. And Andy says that something that Steve would repeat to him was that, "Andy, you are a very complicated man". And that was not a compliment. Andy said that Steve's whole world was simplicity. He wanted everything boiled down to its essence, and he tells us one story. Again, this is -- it just makes yourself -- this direct communication, this blunt communication, I think I really truly believe it makes you easy to interface with.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so Andy was daydreaming one time. He's sitting in a meeting with Steve Jobs and Tim Cook and all these like high-end executives. I think there's like 4 to 6 of like Steve's top team in the room. And Andy is there. And Andy is daydreaming. He is like, "How the hell did I get here? Like how did I wind up here? This is Steve Jobs. I cannot believe this is happening". And so Steve noticed that Andy wasn't paying attention. So he asked him a question related to what they were talking about. And he's like, "Okay, Andy, what do you think about this"? And Andy couldn't answer it. And Steve said, "You weren't paying attention, were you"? And he's like, "No, I wasn't". He goes, "Okay, if I ever notice that again, you won't be in the room and you won't be at Apple". Think about that. Do you think at the end of that exchange was Andy left like, I wonder what he meant by that, what should I do next? No, you know exactly, blunt communication is simple. Again, I think this part that blunt communication makes your standards easy to understand for others, it's very important it's also not just -- Steve Jobs is not the only person that did this. So I obviously know. I make all these episodes on Michael Jordan. I'm kind of obsessed with his competitive nature. And I was rewatching the documentary The Last Dance. And there was a couple of things that Michael said that I think he shares in common with Steve Jobs and actually took screenshots of what Michael was talking about. And so I want to compare when Michael came to the Chicago Bulls in 1984 to when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997. And so Michael and the documentary is talking about why -- when they're winning championships, when they are -- when all these new people come in after the Bulls won the third championship like why are you so hard in your teammates, Michael? And he says, again, this is very clear communication, "When I got here, we were s_*_", meaning the Chicago Bulls were a terrible, terrible team when he got there. And we got to elevate to being a championship-quality team. This is the punch line.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

There are certain standards that you have to live by. And when I saw that, and I'm reading this book. I'm thinking about what Michael Jordan said on The Last Dance, so thinking about Ken Segall's writing in this book. I thought of -- there's this guy named Mike Moritz, a lot of people describe him as the best venture capitalist of all time. Way before he's a venture capitalist, he wrote this book called The Little Kingdom, how Apple and Steve Jobs changed the world. It was published. The book is published before Steve Jobs gets kicked out the first time. Mike is a fantastic writer, transitions from being a journalist to an investor, winds up being world-class at that as well. But then what's most fascinating is Michael updates the book, I think somewhere maybe 2008, 2009, something like that. And he -- the updated version is the version I read. And now it's called Return to The Little Kingdom. I want to read this. Tell me this is not the exact same thing that Michael Jordan is talking about. Michael Moritz is discussing the unparalleled story of Apple, right? Michael Jordan just said, "Hey, when I came to The Bulls, when I got here, we were s_*_. And we elevated to being a championship-quality team. And so, therefore, you're coming in new to something we built, so I'm going to insist that there are certain standards that you have to live by". Michael Jordan was the leader of The Bulls just like Steve Jobs was the leader of Apple. And this is what Mike Moritz said on the unparalleled story of Apple. This is why I keep making podcast after podcast, reading book after book of Steve Jobs. Why is it so important for you and I to revisit this to talk about this every few weeks, every few months, at least, hopefully, a couple of times a year, because this is what Mike Moritz said, "Many are familiar with the re-emergence of Apple. They may not be as familiar with the fact that it has a few if any parallels". When did a founder ever return to the company from which he had been so rudely rejected to engineer a turnaround as complete and spectacular as Apple's? While turnarounds are difficult in any circumstances, they are doubly difficult in a technology company. It is not too much of a stretch to say that Steve founded Apple not once but twice, and the second time he was alone. Steve Jobs would not complete that turnaround without crystal clear communication. So this is also something that why it's also rare.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It's rare in like, let's say, the normal population and probably extremely common in the population of the people that you and I study, these world-class entrepreneurs because most people don't want blunt communication because blunt communication creates conflict. That is why it's rare. There's a great line from Jeff Bezos. So Jeff Bezos is known for being a very blunt communicator. Jeff Bezos says -- I think in the shareholders, if I'm not mistaken, he said that he would take conflict over agreement every time because he believes that conflict produces a better result. Most people don't want conflict. Jeff Bezos didn't run from it, he wasn't afraid of it. Steve Jobs would agree. He did not clearly turn down and run from conflict, from blunt communication. And I think what Steve and Jeff both share in common -- and again, I've done what, I don't know, 7 episodes on Jeff, Steve and Jeff had one thing in common, or they had a bunch of things common, but one thing above all is they put the quality of the work above being liked. And this idea of blunt communication, this idea of being very easy to understand, it's not just when Steve was speaking to you, it's also in his written material as well. So there's a great thing in the book that I want to read to you. And it's about -- Ken made these ads, and then he gets an e-mail from Apple's legal team. And he says, "I was surprised one day I would get an e-mail from the Apple lawyers concerning a newspaper ad that was going to run in just 3 days. Steve Jobs had already approved it. Now Apple's lawyers are saying that they had some problems with it. So doing my duty, I sent an e-mail to Steve advising him that there was a wrench in the works, his own legal team. I asked Steve for his guidance. Just minutes after I hit the Send button, his reply landed in my Inbox, f_*_ the lawyers". So again, so far, we have 2 examples of Steve communicating directly with Ken. One was they were having a conversation, love your TV work, your print work is s**_. Ken knows immediately what to do. Now, in an e-mail, he is saying f_** lawyers. What do you think like Ken knows would do? Steve is saying, run the ad. And another very valuable consequence of the simplicity is that Steve was able to run his business. He ran his business as if there was little time to waste. He was like this since he was like a kid. Remember, I told you a story when he was a 19-year-old working for Nolan Bushnell.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

One of Steve's heroes was the founder of Sony, Akio Morita, and one of the most successful Sony products of all time are the Walkman or was the Walkman. And so Steve is like, oh, okay, we can call ours the MacMan. And if that idea wasn't in this book, you would have never believed that Steve Jobs would come up with such a terrible product name. There's another crazy idea that does not sound like Steve at all, but he was seriously considered. His idea was like, hey, what if instead -- at the time they were charging for operating system upgrades that Apple just gives you for free now. And so you pay $99 or $129, something like that, to upgrade the operating system on your Mac. And he's like, "Hey, what if we gave it away for free, and we just did an ad-supported version of macOS? And instead of buying them, you can get it for free, but you have to watch an ad every time before you use your computer". What? That doesn't sound like Steve Jobs, right? And thankfully, both of those ideas, Steve changed his mind, and again, just this constant iteration, let's surround myself with the small groups of smart people, let's make suggestions, let's make changes, and over time, our products will improve. Simplicity and Focus Okay. So I'm going to move on to the third thing I want to talk to you about, which is I mentioned earlier that the #1 is like the supporting actor, the supporting cast in this book. And there's a line -- the first time I read the book I never forgot about, and it says the further you get away from one, the more complexity that you invite in. And so I want to talk about their advertising first, but I think this applies to more than just ad. So your goal is a single idea expressed clearly. And for advertising, you really should try to pick just one message per ad. And so this is another example where they're going over this idea for ads for a new Apple product, and Steve is like, well, there's 5 things they do really well. We should mention all 5 things in the ad. And the founder of the advertising agency and a close friend of Steve Jobs for like 3 decades, this guy name Lee Clow, he did this demonstration of the difference between a good ad and a bad ad.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Nolan Bushnell was the founder of Atari. He was Steve Jobs’ mentor. He is like a decade older than Steve Jobs. And he wrote an entire book about what that was like. And he's like, "Oh, Steve had one speed, go". And I think that clear communication helped with that because you can't move fast if your communication isn't simple and easy to understand. So before I move on from this section, what is the opposite -- if you really think about it, what is the opposite of blunt communication? What is the opposite of direct communication? Ken makes the case, and he picks a great word for this. He says that it's meandering communication. So I went to the dictionary and the definition of meandering, and you apply it to communication as communication that moves slowly in no particular direction with no clear purpose. Communication that takes a turn instead of traveling in a straight line. If you rambled, Steve would cut you off. If you move slow, he would fire you. So that's Steve using simplicity in the way he communicated. Now another way he used simplicity is how he organized his team. So his favorite way to work is small groups of very smart people. And in fact, Steve was speaking at a conference. It was the All Things D Conference shortly before he died. And you could see that he's clearly very sick. And he was talking about this in very early days. I'll give you an example of when he was building the Macintosh, when he's in age 20, and then right before he died, he says, "We have zero committees. We are organized like a startup. One person is in charge of iPhone OS. One person is in charge of Mac hardware. One person is in charge of marketing. One person is in charge of operations. We are organized like a start-up. We are the biggest start-up on the planet". And I think the main principle here is not only is it simpler, but if you think about this, the ultimate -- if the ultimate decision-maker is involved in every step of the way, Steve would -- Steve believed that the quality of the work increases. It's also -- I think he's right about that. And I also think that it's just the way he like to work. In fact, there's a line in the book, there's a quote in the book where Steve says, "The way I like to work is where I touch everything". One of my favorite maxims that you see that appears over and over again if you analyze what's actually taking place in all of these books that you and I are reading and talking about, is that actions express priority.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Steve shows you with his actions how he spends his time what's important to him. So there's a ton of examples in the book. But like Steve did not believe in delegating marketing and advertising decisions at all. This is not an exaggeration. He approved every single image that was used in an ad. He would approve every single word. He would deliberate over the copy. This is when he's calling Ken at midnight to talk about a single word. The degree to which he did this cannot be understated. It didn't matter if it was a billboard in Missouri or a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal. It is not going out until he approves it. And so there's no way you can work like this unless you have a very simplified structure. He hated what he called big company behavior. And so let me give an example. It's very common for executive CEOs, founders of giant companies, you have people filtering all kinds of things for you, right? But Steve put the quality of the product above everything else. And then, he says in another book, "Hey, I truly believe that we're making the best products in the world. I want every single person in the world to have an access to an Apple device", which is funny because the way they're priced, but his whole point was that to do that, we have to get world-class not only of building -- we already built world-class products, but we had to get world-class at marketing. And so I remember when I read that for the first time, and I think this is Episode 204, so a long time ago, many, many years ago. And I remember the note I left myself that I was trying to like put it into my own words like what is he saying here, and I was like, "Oh, if you believe that your product will improve the life of your customer, then you have a moral obligation to get good at marketing". I believe that is what Steve Jobs believed. And, yet, in this book, there's an actually interesting idea for you and I on how to do that. So the way I think about what the lesson is in the book is like, if this is important to you, it's one of your top priorities, right, do not let other people filter for you. And so Steve did something that's very interesting. So obviously, he's got marketing people on his marketing and advertising team, right? He got outside ad agencies. He insisted on seeing the ads before his executives. He didn't want them to filter what he saw because they could start guessing like, "Oh, Steve won't like this. We don't need to show that one to him". He said, "No, no, I don't want this filtered at all. The ads are created by advertising agency. They go straight to me".

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Another way that was very fascinating is think about if you've ever been in these meetings. They like pitch their idea to you, like you have maybe the image or the demo of what the ad is going to look like, maybe it's the video, and they want to like set it up, and they're like setting it up, and they narrate to you before, and he's like stop doing that. And he has a great -- again, this is just simple clear communication, are you going to be sitting next to me explaining these things when I see the ad in the newspaper? And the answer is, of course not. And so if you really think about it like one of the supporting characters of this book is the #1. Steve was obsessed with trying to get as close to the #1 as possible. We'll talk more about that in a little bit. But I was thinking about what he was saying. He was like, "Oh, well, the only thing more simple than one is zero ". And by -- what's happening in this meeting is like, "Oh, we wants zero words. He wants to see it just like a potential customer would see it". And how this is related to this idea that Steve wanted to be organized like a start-up. He just wanted these small groups of smart people all dedicated to a single thing, have one top priorities. Ken talks about the amount of people in a meeting where they are literally deciding what Apple ads the public is going to see. It's like there's a handful of people. He talks about other companies in the book where he'll count. There would be like 32 people in the room. Steve Jobs would never allow that. There's stories in the book where if he notices a spectator to a meeting that is not essential, he will ask them why are you here? And if there's not a good response, he'll make them leave. Simplicity's best friend is small groups of smart people. So he did this in the beginning of his career. So his commitment to small groups of smart people sometimes included designing the team within constraint. So when he was building the first Macintosh, he in his 20s. He limited the team to 100 people. If you wanted to add a person, if you say, "Hey, we need this person's help", you first have to find the person that was unnecessary and replace him.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then I'm really glad that I reread this book after I just read the book on how Walt Disney built Disneyland because I didn't understand the first time through without that additional context that there's another benefit when it comes to just organizing your entire team or company into these small groups of smart people. Because if you're doing something new and creative, creativity is not a process, it's not scripted. And something that Steve had in common with Walt Disney was they were both comfortable with an absence of process. And so I want to read this excerpt to you from the book that I just did on Episode 347, where the entire book is well, how did Walt Disney built what he considered as a masterpiece, which is Disneyland. And so we have a guy working for -- Walt Disney said, you asked the question, what was the process like, I kind of laugh because process is an organized way of doing things. I have to remind you during the Walt period of designing Disneyland, we didn't have processes. We just did the work, process came later. All of these things have never been done before. Walt had gathered up all these people who had never designed a theme park. They had never designed a Disneyland. So we're in the same boat at one time, and we figure out what to do and how to do it on the fly as we go along and not even discuss plans, timing or anything. We just worked, and Walt just walked around and made suggestions. That's the idea where Walt is just walking around and making suggestions. If you read all these books on Steve Jobs, it's very similar. There's an absence of process. Steve made suggestions, changes were made, then Steve will review the changes and make more suggestions. Walt Disney and Steve Jobs both trusted their own taste and judgment. So another great reason to read this spoke too is like, I'm not saying that Steve's taste and judgment were perfect. In this book, you have one of -- undoubtedly, one of the greatest entrepreneurs to ever do it. The book is full of bad ideas coming from Steve. Let me give you an example. So, Ken Segall, the author, he is the one that came up with the name iMac, and thank God, he did because you know what Steve wanted to call the iMac before it was called iMac. He wanted to call the iMac, MacMan.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So Lee crumpled up a piece of paper into a ball and threw it to Steve and asked him to catch it. And Steve was able to. And Lee says that is a good ad. Then he crumpled up 5 pieces of paper into little balls and threw them all towards Steve at the same time and asked him to catch them, and Steve didn't catch any of them. And Lee said, that is a bad ad. And Lee's point was that the more things that you ask people to focus on, the less that they remember. So I remember reading James Dyson's autobiography for the first time. I've read it 3 times since then. The last time was Episode 300, if you want to listen to it again. But he said something also. He's like, you simply cannot mix your messages when selling something new. A consumer can barely handle one great new idea let alone 2 or even several. So he talks about in the book when Dyson's first product, it is that cyclonic vacuum cleaner, he thought it was the world's best vacuum cleaner. A byproduct of the product he made though, an added benefit was the fact that the vacuum cleaner could also be used as a dry cleaner for your clothes. James never, never mentioned that in his ads. He let the customer discover that use later on because in the marketing in the vacuum cleaner, he learned what Lee Clow had learned as well. Your goal is a single message, a single idea expressed clearly, one message per ad. So then you have this principle, the further you get away from one, the more complexity you invite in for products, and it compares the operating system upgrades of Apple and Windows. So at this time, Apple offered the operating system Leopard as an upgrade. It had 1 version and 1 price. Microsoft was offering Windows Vista at this time. It had 4 versions, all with different features and all at different prices. And it's funny to see the difference today because this book is 15 years old. I just saw that there's 4 different versions of the Apple Pencil. There's no way that Steve would like that.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

There's another great story in the book where he's got a team that at the time they're trying to figure out, okay, you have this file on your computer from iMovie, you have this whole movie you want to put into a physical form. You want to make it into like a DVD. And so his team comes up with like this complicated presentation. He just ignores the presentation, walks over to the whiteboard, and he starts drawing out. He says, "This is the application. It's got one window. You drag the video into the window, and then, it has one button". Again, further you get away from one, the more complexity involvement. That one button says Burn. And then he says, that's it. That is what we're going to make, and then, he walked out of the room. After Steve Jobs died, Jony Ive gave this great interview with Vanity Fair, and he said something I'll never forget. I've mentioned it multiple times. He said that Steve was the most remarkably focused person he ever knew. So he -- Steve would even do this when -- the advice he gave or the direction, he wouldn't even advice, he made it mandatory. The direction he gave his advertising agency. He is like, listen, for every single quarter, we're going to have a single focus. So whatever product or feature that we are focused on, we're going to be focused on that for the entire quarter. It's going to be mentioned in every ad, and it's going to be the main thing you see when you go to apple.com. Steve's most important concern was making things easier for customers. And so this entire thing when you think about this third section where it's like focus on one, the further you get away from one, the more complexity you invite in. There's two things, I think, Steve understood instinctively that when you attempt to communicate more than one thing, you were dividing your audience's attention. And the reason I think that, that was an instinctual thing to him is because he applied it to both internally, so like his teammates, his employees, and externally to his ads and his marketing, this idea, when you attempt to communicate more than one thing, you were dividing your audiences attentions, very important. Number two, people find more words confusing. I love to read. I love to read probably -- as you know, probably more than 99% of the people in the planet, whatever that number is, it drives me bats_*_ crazy when I read an 800-page book, and it's very common.

You read an 800-page book when that book should have been 400, 300 pages. Editing your thinking is an active service, and it takes time and effort. That's why people don't do it. There's this famous saying that I was thinking of when I got to this section because I'm jotting down. I'm trying to like interpret it, like distill these ideas, so I remember them in the shortest amount of time possible. And I was like, oh, this is like this thing that's attributed to many different people, but it says, "I would have written you a shorter letter, but I didn't have the time". And so that's been attributed to people like Mark Twain, Cicero and Pascal. In fact, after I took that note to myself, the fact that people find more words confusing, you need to edit your thinking. And I really think editing is an act of service, but I was rereading Steve's shareholder letters from Pixar. And his 1997 shareholder -- this is hilarious, how everything is connected, in his 1997 shareholder letter, he says -- he quotes -- he attributes to Pascal in the letter that I would have written you a shorter letter, but I didn't have time. And he's like, "Well, since I'm only working on Pixar, I have plenty of time, so I'm going to write you a long letter for this shareholder letter". But he certainly didn't do that when he went back to Apple. He didn't do it internally, and he didn't do it externally. He understood that people find more words confusing, and that you really need to edit your thinking down to its essence. And I think viewing that as an act of service to other people because that is what it is, our time here is limited, do not take 2 hours to say something you can say in 15 minutes. Don't take 1,000 words when you can draw a picture. Editing is an act of service. So the fourth thing that I want to talk about and why simplicity is so important because simple is fast. So he comes back, this is hilarious story, because they're working on hiring a new advertising agency, Apple, as I should be more clear here. So at the time, Gil Amelio is the CEO of Apple. He's the one that buys -- that makes the decision to buy NeXT. He is the CEO of Apple right before Steve Jobs takes over. And when Steve comes back, and now, he takes over Apple, Gil is fired. Gill had this like really complicated ongoing process to pick a new advertising agency. Keep in mind, they're losing money. If they do not turn things around, they will literally run out of money and go bankrupt.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And Gil's idea is like, okay, we're going to -- we need a new advertising agency, and this is the way we are going to do it. We're going to interview more than 20 different advertising agencies and then compare them and then pick the best one. Steve comes back immediately, and he cancels this entire process. Right before Charlie Munger died, he said something that's so important, and he said that trust is one of the greatest economic forces on earth. And what Steve did here is a perfect example of that. Steve canceled his entire process, and he called somebody that he trusted. He called somebody that he had a relationship with. He calls his old friend, Lee Clow. Lee Clow is the one that did the 1984 Macintosh ad. That was a decade before where we are in the story. Steve trusted Lee, and that trust enabled them to move faster. That is so much simple than sitting down -- I mean interviewed, how do you even interview 20 different advertising agencies? How long is that going to take? And then you have to whittle them down. Okay, now, we've got our top 10; now we've got our top 5; now we're down to 2 or 3, simple is fast. So Steve Calls Lee. They immediately start working. The second ad they do is the Here's to the Crazy Ones ad. And so in the book, Ken is talking about that the fact that, that ad was created -- they came up with the ad, they made it, and they aired it in less time than it would have taken Gil Amelio to complete all the initial meetings for the 20 different advertising agencies. Gil was being complex, and so, therefore, he was moving slow. Steve was being simple, so, therefore, he moved fast. There's a hilarious story. I did this episode on Herb Kelleher, which is the founder of Southwest. He's one of my favorite founders I have ever studied. I find him wildly entertaining. It's Episode 322, if you haven't heard it yet. But he -- Herb also had this like religious dedication to simplicity. And so there's a fantastic story in the book that I think is related to what Steve was doing at Apple and why simplicity is so important because it's fast, so -- it says Herb Keller illustrates the speed with which Southwest moves by telling a story about Don Valentine, former VP of Marketing. Why would he be Former? I wonder why.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Valentine had just joined from Dr. Pepper, so a big slow bureaucratic organization, no disrespect to them, right? Valentine had just joined from Dr. Pepper when the marketing group met in January. You got to remember these dates. January, they're meeting in January to discuss a new television campaign. Valentine was ready with his timeline for producing spots. I'm going to try not to laugh already. We're meeting in January. So this is what he says, "Okay, we're ready guys. Let's do this. We're going to write the script in March”. “Pardon me, two months from now, we're going to write the script in March. We're going to get script approval in April. Remember, we're in January for God's sake”. So we're going to write the script in March. We're going to get script approval in April. We're going to cast this commercial in June. What the -- what are you doing? And we're going to shoot it in September. When Valentine finished, Herb said, "Don, I hate to tell you, but we're talking about next Wednesday. We're not running this ad nine months from now. We're not going to take nine months. We're going to make an ad, and it's going to be done and shot by next Wednesday, simple as fast”. And I think what the advice that Herb would give you, and I think the advice that Steve would give you, if you feel you're not moving fast enough, narrow your scope, simplify, and then up the intensity. And there's another thing that Herb and Steve had, this is the fifth thing I want to tell you about. And this is another thing that they both had in common, and it is how they taught, how they taught? There is a casual conversation with the ultimate decision-maker. And the reason I thought about this section too is like why would -- why do I want to name this like how Steve taught? There's a great line from Jim Sinegal, who's the founder and former CEO of Costco. And he says, "as a leader, if you're not spending 90% of your time teaching, you're not doing your job". What did Michael Jordan say, he was teaching -- he was the leader of the team, he was teaching his team. There are certain standards that you live by. This is the Chicago Bull way. This is the Apple way. This is the Southwest Airlines way. Jim Sinegal is saying, this is how we do things at Costco. If you're not spending 90% of your time teaching, you're not doing your job.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And the way Steve taught was through conversations. He says in the book if you had this like slick presentation -- this is internally, okay? I'm going to do an entire new -- the next episode will be about how Steve Jobs sold. And I'll tell you more about that in a minute. But if you had a slick presentation internally, Steve suspected that you spent the value -- the limited valuable time that you had, wrapping the idea, making it beautiful instead of spending the time thinking through the idea itself and getting to its essence. He talks about that over and over again, get to the essence of the idea, boil everything down, do not use -- when he told Andy -- Andy Miller, the guy that sold this company for $275 million to Steve, that I mentioned earlier, something Andy says in that video that Steve would say, “Do not use 10 words when you can use one. Use a picture instead of a deck with 100 words”. He would tell Andy over and over again, “You have to think like an Apple guy”. That is him -- that is Steve teaching Andy. This is the standards of excellence we have. This is how we do things at Apple. Great companies have distinct cultures. They have a distinct way of doing things. I just spent the week with one of the most valuable private companies. It's run by -- I'm not going to name the company or who the person is, but I would say he is the 78-year-old founder who's been running the company for 45 years. It's just like I described it as like, oh, I spent the week inside of one of these books. It is very obvious when you interact with all the -- I was with their top executives or 40 top executives and the founder. It is very obvious they have a distinct culture, and they are literally the best-in-class in their industry. And one of the executives said the founder has all -- I think it's like 10,000 people, 11,000 people, all marching in the same direction. You would say that about Steve Jobs, you would say that about Herb Kelleher. And what is remarkable is how informal Steve was. This is how he's teaching his entire company. It's a casual conversation with the ultimate decision-maker.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And if you can center these casual conversations around a demo or a picture, even better, but Steve would just talk about why the product needs to exist, how the product worked, and why it is different and better than other products. And he loved to use visuals if he could instead of words because he thought a picture was simpler than words. Again, he's trying to make things as simple as possible. So he would -- there's many examples in the book, and I'll talk about this more and how he gave presentations, too. He would just like jump up, he'd have the conversation, and he would draw out the idea. If there wasn't a demo of like the software or the product there or an image of it, he would draw on the whiteboard as a way to illustrate his point. And there is a fascinating line in the book that said that Steve acted as his own slide show. He did not want to see a slide show with a bunch of bullet points. He would tell you converse with people rather than present to them. There is one exception to that rule, and that's when Steve did the new product presentation for Apple's new products. That was not a casual conversation. That was a presentation. That presentation was painstakingly choreographed. He was relentless about rehearsing it. He had backup plans for everything. The thing that was the same about the internal conversations and the external presentation that it was that he loved using images, demos, simple language, and then ideas stripped down to its essence. I'm not going to spend too much time here because the next episode I read an entire book on how Steve Jobs prepared for presentations that I think is going to be very valuable to you and I because a business is sales. The Hearst Principle We're selling customers. We're selling employees in the company a mission. We're selling recruits on why you want to join the company. And I think the book that I'm going to talk about in the next episode is really a blueprint from a super salesman, a master salesman that Steve Jobs was. And the last thing I want to talk to you about is a way to find a simple path forward. And I actually called this the Hearst principle. I came up with a name myself. So I'm -- this biography of William Randolph Hearst that I met -- read many years ago, and there's an idea in it that I think can be applied to whatever industry that you're working in. So I want to get to one of the most important things that I ever read, and it took me rereading it multiple times for it to actually sync in and have a fundamental understanding of what it actually meant.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

There's a line in Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs that says one of Jobs’ talents was spotting markets that were filled with second-rate products. And when you analyze Steve Jobs career through that lens, that one of his greatest talents was spotting markets that were filled with second-rate products, you see it over and over again. He did this with computers. He did this with MP3 players. He did this with phones. He did this with tablets. And one of the hallmarks of a second-rate product is the fact that is it’s too complex. I'm going to read from the book because I think this is so important. This is describing because -- remember, this is the focus on really the turnaround of Apple. The iPod really was the product that helped Apple turn the corner. And so when Steve analyzed that, he says, “That he believed that the music player category needed most was simplicity and whichever company delivered it would soon be running this planet”. That is a quote from Steve Jobs, whichever company delivered it would soon be running this planet. It turned out that one key insight allowed Apple to leap ahead of the other company, Steve explained in a 2006 interview. Now this is Steve's words, “We had the hardware expertise, the industrial design expertise and the software expertise, including iTunes. One of the biggest insights we had was that we decided not to try to manage your music library on the iPod, but to manage it in iTunes. Other companies try to do everything on the device itself and made it so complicated that it was useless”. In other words, we analyze everything that our competitors were doing and in focusing on what they were not doing, we found a simple path forward. So why do I call that the Hearst principle? William Randolph Hearst built a media empire that would be worth like $30 billion in today's dollars. And it started out with a single newspaper in San Francisco that his father gave to him. And so at the time, there was a bunch of other newspapers, the competitors in the -- serving the same city, right? They're all in San Francisco. Their newspapers were very similar. There's very little differentiation. And their distribution, the way they are selling, there's no differentiation. They would sell, they'd hire these things, these little kids called newsies.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

They're like little boys. They're like 9, 10, 12 years old. And they'd roam around the street selling the newspaper for a $0.01 or $0.02. And so William Randolph Hearst is looking at this, right? And he's like, "I want to build a media empire. I have one newspaper. I want to expand. I have little product differentiation. I have no distribution differentiation. What should I do?" And he realizes like, “Well, the people in San Francisco are not unique. They're like people everywhere. They read the newspaper because they want to know what's going on in the world, what's going on in the country, what's going on in sports and business and everything else that newspapers read about. And yet, me and all my competitors are just focused about the resonance in San Francisco. Is there something that my competitors are not doing? Are there markets that my competitors are ignoring that I can attack”? And so what he did was he put his newspapers on trains and started sending them to all the communities that might be 100 miles from San Francisco, 200 miles from San Francisco. He is like, “Well, they don't live in San Francisco, but they're the same kind of people, and they're probably interested in the same things”. So instead of fighting what might have been a losing battle, just kind of like cutting prices and doing the exact same thing as his competitors, he put his newspapers on trains and drastically expanded the market. This immediately works. He starts making much more money than his competitors, and then, he uses that extra money to start buying up his competitors, and he expands to other cities. That is the beginning of what turns into this giant multi-tens of billions of dollars empire, all of that from a relatively simple idea. So the Hearst principle is very simple, you write down on a piece of paper everything that your competitors are doing, whether in the product design or their distribution, then you draw a giant X across it, you tell yourself you cannot do it the way they're doing it, and you force yourself to think about new ways and new solutions. It's the exact same thing. He didn't -- probably didn't write it on a piece of paper. He didn’t -- certainly didn't call it the Hearst principle. But if you think about what Steve Jobs is telling us is to analyze what all those competitors are doing. He attacked a market for the second-rate products. He says, "If I can't do that, I'm forced to find a new way,” and he found a new and better way and that changed the trajectory of Apple forever.

And I think this quote from Steve Jobs is a perfect place to close. Simple can be harder than complex. You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple, but it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains. And that is where I'll leave it. Highly recommend buying the book, reading the book, keeping it close to you. It's a great resource.

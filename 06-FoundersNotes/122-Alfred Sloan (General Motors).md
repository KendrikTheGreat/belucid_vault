So of course, you can't really understand Alfred Sloan if you don't understand Billy Durant and vice versa. So he's going to talk a lot about Durant in this book. His book was published about 20 years after Durant died. So he says, Durant's pioneer work has yet to receive the recognition it deserves," he's writing that in 1963, still the case today. Most people don't know who the Founder of General Motors is. Everybody knows who the founder of Ford is. "His philosophy was an emerging one in the Model T era and it was afterwards to be realized, not by him but by others, including myself." So what is he saying in that paragraph? Durant came up with the idea, I executed it. This is Sloan on Durant and Ford building personality-driven companies. He says, "They were a generation of what I might call personal types of industrialists. That is they injected their personalities, their genius as a subjective factor into their operations without the discipline of management by methods and objective facts." So the first half of that sentence is, Sloan giving him credit to what he feels were their best attributes. The second half was what they didn't do well, and what he feels he did well. Now this is also interesting because when I read that section, it made me think of this quote by Charlie Munger that I never forgot. He says that you must follow your natural drift. And he talks about he graduated from law school. He started practice as an attorney. A lot of his other clients are business people. And he's like, "I'm not suited to be an attorney. I don't want to do this. I want to invest in businesses, and I want to be a business person. I want to be an entrepreneur and I want to be an investor." And he talked about like this plenty of -- like he just had to be who he was. That's what he means by following your drift. So Sloan is talking about they're injecting their personality into their businesses. I think everybody injects their personality into their craft. I just think the people who are the best are the ones that lean into whatever makes them unique.

“We knew that the product had great potential, but I can hardly say that any of us realize the extent to which the automobile would transform the world, reshape the entire economy, call new industries into being, and alter the pace and style of everyday life. It was my personal satisfaction to be associated as a supplier or a competitor with a large number of the able citizens who created and contributed to the development of this industry. The names of a few of them, by their association with cars and companies, stand for a new American legend, Mr. Ford, Mr. Buick, Mr. Chevrolet, Mr. Olds, Mr. Chrysler. Involved with thousands of others in the destiny of this industry, they conducted the prosaic operations of running a business without being aware of the revolution they were making. The field was open to all. Technical knowledge flows from a common storehouse of scientific progress. The techniques of production are an open book. The market is worldwide, and there are no favorites, except those chosen by the customers. When we started on this great adventure in the early 1900s, the whole automotive industry was searching for ways and means to find itself. In those early days, we lacked the techniques that today are taken for granted. Things just seem to happen to us and to the industry. The number of sales by dealers was unknown. The number of cars held by dealers was unknown. Trends in consumer demands were unknown. There was no awareness of the importance of the used car market. There were no statistics on the different cars' market penetration. No one kept track of registrations. Production schedules were set with no real relationship to final demand. Our products had no plan relation to one another or to the market. The concept of a line of products to meet the full challenge in the market had not been thought of. We had to start from the beginning. My impressions of all of this after more than 65 years in and around the automobile industry, 45 of them with General Motors, are the basis for this book.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

All right. So that's an excerpt from the book that I'm going to talk to you about today, which is 'My Years With General Motors' by Alfred Sloan. Okay. Back on Founders 110, I covered -- this was the second podcast I did on Henry Singleton, and I talked to you about the book called 'Distant Force: A Memoir of the Teledyne Corporation and the Man Who Created It.' This is the book I was reading where I first found out about Alfred Sloan's autobiography, which is the one I'm going talk you about today. But I want to read an excerpt before I jump into the lessons from Alfred Sloan from Distant Force. And it says, "Henry talked to me on several occasions about a book by the former Chairman of General Motors Corporation. He told me he had learned a very important concept from that book, which he wished to use in the growth of Teledyne. He explained that in about 1921 or 1922 after World War I, and during a very difficult economic time of recession, General Motors had needed additional funds to finance their growth and had a plan to sell bonds to the general public. The bond sale was a complete failure, and the Chairman had written in his book that it taught him an important lesson. It was that for a corporation to grow and to have a strong financial base, it needed to have, as part of itself, an interest in substantial financially-oriented institutions." So General Motors had started General Motors Acceptance Corporation, also known as GMAC, and invested in other financial groups. "As a result" -- and this is the important part. "As a result of his interest in the idea, Henry had decided that at some point, when Teledyne had reached a certain size, he would seek out financial organizations we could acquire. So near the very end of our acquisition period, we did go in that direction before we finally stopped. We began acquiring a number of financial and insurance companies, which was a significant change from our usual aerospace, metals, industrial and consumer company acquisitions." So the note I left that -- when I read that part of the book, the note I left on that page was actually another quote that is found in Poor Charlie's Almanac.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And it explains why Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett are so fanatical about reading biographies and studying history. And he says, "There are ideas worth billions in a $30 history book." And for -- in the case of Henry Singleton and Teledyne, the effect that the book that we're going to talk about today that had the effect of the -- one idea that Henry found in that book is literally true. It had a multibillion dollar effect on the outcome of Teledyne. And it's just another -- to me, it's just another illustration of why we're on the right path with what we're doing here at Founders by going through and reading all these biographies because there's so many ideas that people spend their entire careers and, in many cases, making mistakes that they warn you to not follow in their path. So I just wanted to bring that to your attention to tie all this together. I want to jump right into this book. I want to first start talking about I think what jumps off the page as soon as you study Alfred Sloan. So again, we talked about Sloan a lot in the last 2 podcasts because we were talking about the Founder of General Motors, Billy Durant. And so the way to think about how Sloan fits into the picture as we continue this multiple part series is, we're studying the early automobile industry founders and pioneers is Billy Durant started the company and Sloan perfected it, okay? So first, something to know about Sloan is he was -- a striking difference between him and Durant. Durant had a ton of different things he juggle at one time. He'd be investing. He'd run a bunch of different companies. Sloan had a singular focus, and he says so here.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He says, "General Motors and the Hyatt Roller Bearing Company have been almost the sole interest of my business life." And I think that's one of the things -- just like similar to Henry Singleton, even though Singleton ran a conglomerate, he was -- he had a singular focus. And I think that's something that -- when I started studying Henry Singleton something that has changed the way I want to approach my life and something, an idea I hope I never let go of. All right. Another thing to know about Sloan. He always thought big, and I love this idea. He says, "I simply took the view that we should go at the job vigorously and without hampering restrictions. I put no ceiling on progress." And this gives you a good indication of his personality. He's extremely serious, extremely dedicated and extremely driven. So this is Sloan. Now this is -- this is funny. This is advertised as like an autobiography. It's not an autobiography. He talks about his personal life and his family and the stuff you would expect to find in an autobiography for like a few paragraphs. The vast majority is extremely detail-oriented around the decisions he made while running General Motors. And I've read in other books that he had over 20 different researchers helping him go through the archives of General Motors to pull out minutes for meetings, all kinds of stuff. So this book is massive. It's 600 pages, so it's extremely detailed. But I do want to tell you a little bit of his early life to the small degree that he covers it. This is Sloan and his family traits. He says, "I think we all -- we have all had in common a capability of being dedicated to our respective interests." So he talks about -- he is talking about his siblings there that whatever profession they chose, they all chose different professions, but they took it very seriously. A little bit about his early life. And as I read this section to you, I just want you to think about, we see this trend again and again. Sloan was at the right place at the right time with the right set of skills. And so he's indicating that to us here. He says, "I came of age at almost exactly the time when the automobile business in the United States came into being.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

In 1895, the first gasoline automobile manufacturing company in the United States was started. That same year, I left MIT with a BS in Electrical Engineering and went to work for the Hyatt Roller Bearing Company. The Hyatt Bearing, the product they're making, was later to become a component of the automobile. And it was through this component that I came into the automotive industry." Remember, he worked in the industry for 65 years. "Except for one early and brief departure from it, I have spent my life in the industry." So think about how valuable that is. He has over 6 decades of experience in one industry. There are things that we can learn from this person. Now this is what I found fascinating. This is his salary and the job description when he started working at Hyatt Roller Bearing. "We were doing business of under $2,000 a month," so $2,000 a month in revenue. "I was kind of an office boy, a draftsman, a salesman and a general assistant to the enterprise at a salary of $50 a month." Okay. So why am I bringing up? Why is this important? Because this is another example of growing into the person that you need to become. He started at $50 a month. At one time in his life, he is the second richest person in the United States behind Henry Ford. And the other thing I wanted to bring up is the fact that the business when he started working, it was only doing $2,000 a month. Eventually, he takes over this business. This is the same business that he's going to run for about 15 years, something like that, and he sells to Billy Durant for $13.5 million. Okay. So he leaves the company, comes back, they buy Hyatt because it's about to go out of business, so about to be liquidated. And his father buys it with an associate and they give him 6 months to turn it around. So let me just bring you up to speed on this real quick in case you haven't yet listened to last week's podcast. "In 1898, it appeared that the company would have to liquidate. But my father and an associate of his combined to put $5,000 into Hyatt." So $5,000 investment that they went -- his father was the shareholder the entire time up until the point where he sells to Billy Durant.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So they pay $5,000 into Hyatt with the understanding that it would go back for 6 months and see what I can do with it. "At the end of 6 months, we had made some advances in volume and economy, and we made a $12,000 profit that put the business into a position where we recognize that it might be successful." And this is so important. "I could not know then that through Hyatt I had entered into the headwaters of General Motors. So what is Sloan is saying there? He is saying that the opportunity that he was about to be presented was unpredictable. Not only does it become a supplier to General Motors, Ford and others, but of course, General Motors winds up buying the company about 1.5 decades into the future from where we are at. Something to know about Sloan, again, I don't think they're going to write a book about you if you don't have this personality trait. He was persistent and determined. So it says, "For the next 4 or 5 years at Hyatt, we had growing pains. It was difficult to get business. And when we got it and expanded, we needed working capital and we could not get that outside the company." So another contrast to Durant, who wanted to fund most of his company -- money -- his company through stock issuances and collecting people -- money from other people. Sloan grew his company through internally, mainly through profits. "In 5 years, we made progress. Our profits got up to about $60,000 a year." That's amazing considering they were making $2,000 a month when he started working there. "And the prospects improved as the young automobile industry opened up a new market," meaning a new market for the Bearings. Now my 2 favorite parts of reading this book was Sloan has an immense amount of knowledge into the early days of the automotive industry, which I, of course, find fascinating, so I'm reading so many books on it. And second, which I'll get to later is, he's extremely detailed in his head-to-head competition with Henry Ford, which he winds up winning. So I'm going to tell you more about his strategy, which is really fascinating. And he goes into great detail, which is a fantastic part about the book. So on the early days of the automobile industry he says, "My first personal experience with automobiles was much like that of others at the time. I wanted one, but couldn't afford it. Only about 4,000 cars were made in the year 1900, and they were expensive."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then they match up whatever makes them unique and following the natural drift into what they're doing for work. Some people never do that, unfortunately. And so in Sloan's case, I don't think he -- there's a reason why -- there's a bunch of other people that were suppliers first and then turned into automobile manufacturers. The most successful example of that is the Dodge Brothers. Sloan could have done that, but that's not his natural drift. He was meant to be a manufacturer, an engineer and a manager. So I think that's important as we hear what he has to tell us, to teach us that we view it through that lens. All right. So this is Sloan on Durant being more advanced manufacturer than -- he was saying Durant was ahead of his time. And the reason he was so ahead of his time is because he had eyes on vertical integration way ahead of other automobile peers because he -- remember, he had built the GM of horse-drawn transportation. So he says, "Durant, thus, showed a considerable sophistication in economic matters very different from the popular image of him as a mere stock market plunger. I cannot say that he was precise in the application of his economic philosophy." So when he's talking about his economic philosophy, he's talking about vertical integration. "But he emerged" and this is really, really important sentence here. "But he emerged prominently from a period that saw the birth and death of a great many automobile companies." So what is he saying there? You have to respect him because he survived. And Sloan talks about that a lot. So one thing to know about Sloan, extremely focused on profit. And he's not focused on profit just because he's like greedy for money. He's focused on profit because he wants his company to manufacture automobiles. And to do that, they must survive, and the only way to survive is the profits. So he talkies a lot at length that a lot of these other automotive manufacturers did not focus enough on profit and so, therefore, they were at the whims of other financial people, whether banks or investors, to continue putting money into the company.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And when you find, what Sloan was talking about is, when you find yourself in that situation, you're going to -- if you happen to need money, at the same time, there's an economic contraction, which Sloan had to manage, he managed GM for 3 to 4 decades, he had to deal with this constantly, and I'm going to get to more of his crazy, impressive performance during the depression that you're going to find yourself at the whims of those people that have the money. And if they don't want to give it to you, you're done. So to Sloan, he has like a love-hate relationship with Durant, and I'll get to that. He talks about that he views him of in 2 minds, 2 different ways that are in large part contradictions. But this one sentence like he did respect him because he survived. There was tons of people that started companies in the early 1900s. Sloan gets kicked out of GM in 1920, but he lasted 20 years in the early automobile industry. That's insane when you think about thousands, maybe not thousands, hundreds, maybe thousands of companies died in that period, probably hundreds. I don't know if it was thousands. All right. Moving on. This is Sloan on the situation of GM right before he takes over. "Thanks mainly to Mr. Durant, General Motors had then the makings of a great enterprise. But it was in good part, physically unintegrated and in management uncoordinated. The expenditures for new companies, plants and equipment and inventories were terrific, some of them not to bring a return." When he meant terrific, means there was a large amount of money, not that they were great. To his point, he says, "Some of them not to bring a return for a long time, if ever. And as they went up, the cash went down," meaning they had lot to not only manufacturer but to manufacture that number of amount of cars it took an insane amount of money. "Just as General Motors was headed for the crisis from which the modern General Motors Corporation would emerge." So I bring that in there because he says, "You have to go through this tumultuous period. You had to make those mistakes to realize, "Oh, this is a problem. If we don't rectify this, and if we don't course correct here, we're going to go out of business."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so when Sloan takes over, it's a period of crisis. But that's a motivating factor because that allows him or motivated him to build a very, very strong financial base, which he definitely does. I covered last week a little bit about how Sloan looked up most and learned most from Henry Leland, the Founder of Cadillac. I'm not going to cover -- we cover all of it, but I do -- he brings them up a lot in the books so I just want to read a couple of sentences to you. So he says, "He then taught me the need for greater accuracy in our products to meet the exacting standards of interchangeable parts. Mr. Leland came to the industry with a mature experience in general engineering and in gasoline engines, which he had long made for boats. One of his specialties was precision metal work, which went back to his experience in toolmaking for a federal arsenal during the civil war." So think about that. We're in the late 1800s, maybe early 1900s when they're interacting. Henry Leland, they talked about him, he's this white-bearded guy. He had already been -- professional engineer for 40 years, so generation older than Sloan. What could he learn from this person's accumulated experience? A lot, and Sloan definitely sat and learned from him. "It has been called to my attention that Eli Whitney long before had started the development of interchangeable parts in connection with the manufacturer of guns" also during the civil. "A fact, which suggest," this is why I'm including this part. I love this sentence. "A fact, which suggests a line of Descent from Whitney to Leland to the automobile industry." And the reason I love that part is because I thought of this quote that actually comes from Damian Marley of all people. And he says, "The accumulated intelligence of mankind is what's makes us special amongst all other species. Everything is built upon the foundation before it." So not only are we seeing that Leland is building on Whitney and then Sloan builds on Leland, but then who does -- who builds on Sloan? I just started the podcast telling you that Singleton built on Sloan. So this statement is true. Everything is built upon the foundation before it.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And you're doing a great disservice to yourself if you're not studying the foundation. Okay. Sloan on Walter Chrysler, one of his best friends, winds up being a competitor, too. "Mr. Chrysler was a man of high ambition and imagination. He was a practical man with broad capabilities. His genius, I think, was in the organization of automobile production." Definitely, he used to run all of the manufacturing and production for GM. "He can recognize the opportunity offered by the young and promising automobile industry." It's really funny because later in the book, Sloan is talking about how he's competing with Ford, and they're all focused on Ford because it's such a dominating force in the industry. And they're at the time, and I'll get into more on this later, but Sloan is using the lower-priced brand Chevrolet as his main weapon against Ford, and out of nowhere comes Chrysler with another lower-priced car. And he knew he was a formidable character because he knew this guy didn't play. He had a lot of experience. He's really an intelligent person. You have to take him seriously. This is Sloan and why he thought it was a good idea to sell his company to GM. So he says, "Because of the way Hyatt's business had evolved, it had come to depend upon a limited number of customers." So what he's telling us in this section as I continue to rethink about, he's telling us that it's a very dangerous and fragile place to be in, if almost all of your revenue comes from 1 or 2 people. He says, "Ford alone represented about half of the sales. This business, if loss could not be replaced because no new customer of such magnitude existed. Second," so he goes to the 3 -- that's the first reason, this is a second. "I recognize that the kind of roller bearing we made at the time was destined to be supplemented and perhaps superseded by other types and what then? Another reorganization? A different product? In effect, you'd have to create an entire new business," is essentially what he is saying there. "I may say that, in the past 45 years, what I thought then would happen to the product has happened. Hyatt's old type of bearing had gone out of automobile designs." So he's right about that third.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"So in other words, we're lucky that during our time of the organization, we had an increase in sales due to things largely outside of their control." Now Sloan is going to continue to elaborate on GM's plan for the 1920s. And again, I said this over and over again, it's very fascinating how large a part of it had to be in response to the dominant position of Ford. So he says, "It was that planned policy or strategy of 1921, whatever it should be called, which I believe more than any other single factor enabled us to move into the rapidly changing market of the 1920s with the confidence that we knew what we were doing commercially and we were not merely chasing around in search of a lucky star." So to review, he's talking about the ideas like "we're going to use Chevrolet as our wedge to attack Ford. And we're going to say, "Hey, there's another growing market. There's going to be more demand a smidge above Model T. Can't get below Model T, can't get to Model T. We're thinking that customers' taste are changing, therefore, the market is developing, and this is a vehicle we're going to use to overtake Ford, right? The most important particular object of that plan, which followed from strategic principles was to develop a larger place for Chevrolet between the Ford car below the median price group above." So it's a weird sentence. But essentially saying "hey, what I just said, there's the Model T, then you have, where we're up -- we're in the middle, and we're in -- GM was anywhere from the middle of the market, all the way to the top. We're going to say, "Hey, there's a wedge, there's a growing demand right on top of the Model T." It's going to be -- think of GM's product strategy as a pyramid, right? So you have Cadillac at the very top. And as you move down the pyramid, you have -- Cadillac is most expensive, then you have Buick, other brands. At the bottom, his base layer that is going to be Chevy. That's going to be where he's going to get the most actual sales and most revenue, right? So think about -- that's how he's thinking about this here.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"I spent my entire working life. I was 40 years old then developing a property, and I had a large plan with a great deal of responsibility, but I never much yielded out of it dividends. Mr. Durant's offer presented an opportunity to convert Hyatt's profits into readily salable assets." So what he's saying? I want to get paid. I want to know what it's like to be rich. I worked really hard. I want to take some money out, nothing wrong with that. So he winds up -- Durant winds up buying the company. Durant's running this company at the time called United Motors. Don't worry about the name. It's just a proxy to get control of GM and gets folded into GM once Durant gains back controls, so just ignore this part. But the important part is that he's getting out of his comfort zone. We talked about this over and over in the podcast. Comfort is a false God. You're not going to do anything great with your life if you just -- if you try to see comfort constantly. So he says, "For the first time in -- my business horizon widened beyond a single component of the automobile. I became President and Chief Operating Officer at United Motors. United Motors was acquired by GM." Sloan takes a keen interest in GM because he has so much of his net worth tied up in its stock. And this is where he starts telling us he's working at GM as a Vice President, but he's also monitoring Durant because Durant is running the company that is responsible for a large percent of his net worth so he is concerned about it. He said, "I had proprietary as well as professional reasons for taking an interest in the corporation as a whole since most of my personal assets had been converted into GM shares. It was not long therefore before I began to take a close look at Mr. Durant's general policies. I was of 2 minds about Mr. Durant. I admired his automotive genius, his imagination, and his generous human quality." So that's what I admire about him, too. He's extremely likable. You want to root for him when you read his biographies, and his integrity. "His loyalty to the enterprise was absolute, but I thought he was too casual." It's an interesting choice of words there. Some would say Sloan is too serious. I thought he was too casual in his ways of an administrator and he overloaded himself.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Important decisions had to wait until he was free and were often made impulsively." Sloan also questions if Durant was telling the truth. He says, "They didn't see the financial panic coming, the one in 1919, 1920, 1921 area. Mr. Raskob, who's running the company with Durant, came over from DuPont because DuPont had make a large investment." Again, I covered that in the other podcast. If you want to learn more about that go back. "Just as Mr. Raskob went ahead pushing the expansion and paying the bills, Mr. Durant's management methods let things get out of control." So he's talking about what's happening right before Durant gets pushed out. And he's telling us this because this is the end of Durant story and the beginning of his, right? So it says, "I've heard that Mr. Durant became pessimistic about the national economy in late 1919, but I can find no record of it. On the record, both Mr. Durant and Mr. Raskob were strong optimistic expansionists. They seem to disagree on occasion only what to put the money into." So again, Sloan is going to tell you over and over again to be optimistic, but not in the face of uncertain economic conditions if that can lead to the potential bankruptcy of your company. Last week -- so when GM gets -- excuse me, when Durant gets kicked out, he's convinced that there was like stock manipulation, and he was squeezed. And essentially, he's saying, "I got hustled," right? I -- from studying Durant's perspective, I just -- when I see something like that, when you transfer over, Durant's calls it like some of the most valuable securities in the world like for a fraction of what they soon to be worth. I always ask in situations like that, who benefits? And so would it surprise me if DuPont or Morgan had some kind of deal where they wanted Durant's GM stock. No, that wouldn't surprise me at all. It's that human nature, like no, they have a huge financial benefit. And when humans have huge financial benefits, they do things that are in their interest and usually not in theirs.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And you know DuPont wanted as much GM stock as he could get because he already [indiscernible] tens of millions of dollars into his company -- or into General Motor's stock. He could have reinvested that money back in his own company. He's running DuPont -- hugely successful DuPont company at this time. So I don't -- I've read 3 books on this right now. I have no idea who got hustled. Durant feels they manipulated on purpose. Sloan and DuPont are of different minds. And so I'm going to present to you Sloan's opinion on this matter. So he says, "I think also the arrangement the Morgan's and the DuPont's made with him to take over his stock obligations in such a critical period was a generous one. That's a 180-degree difference than Durant thinks." Consider the following. "Mr. Durant's 1921 -- in 1921, Mr. Durant sold back to the DuPont his interest in the company formed to bail him out." He received for his interest 230,000 shares of General Motors' stock, which at the time had a market value of, let's say, $3 million, okay? "Their market value, if he'd held them to the time of his death in 1947," so 20 -- what, 26 years later, "would have been , let's call it, $26 million." So again, Sloan has a completely different opinion of DuPont than does Durant. He feels that the leadership of DuPont after 1920 is what saved the company. Durant would disagree with that statement. At this point, I think we have given up on trying to figure out who's right. I just want you to know that there's multiple different versions of the same story. All right. So this is the end of Durant's story with GM and the beginning of Sloan. "To return to the events of 1920, the slump in the national economy and its impact on the corporation, the lack of control of operations." So this is where he is essentially just saying, "Hey, Durant's running a sloppy company. "And Mr. Durant's resignation shook the enterprise to its foundation and started an entirely new period in its history, which is where the main part of my story begins."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. So there's a brief short few year period between Durant leaves, DuPont winds up running the company, but Sloan is essentially his right hand man and eventually, once the company stabilized in the next like year or 2, I didn't mean like financially stable, it's not growing, but it's not going to go out of business, DuPont puts Sloan in charge, okay? So he says -- this is Sloan on the problem he inherited. "The automobile market had nearly vanished and with it, our income. Most of our plants and those of the industry were shut down. We were loaded with high-priced inventory and commitments at the old, inflated price levels." So what they're talking about there is the inflated price level. "When the demand dropped out, Ford starts cutting prices. And so everybody in the industry has to start cutting prices. But the problem is now you have all these -- you have some dealers who have bought -- let's say, the car is going to go for $1,000, now you can buy it for $750. What do you do in this case? We were short of cash. We had a confused product line. There's a lack of control and of any means of control in operations and finance and a lack of adequate information about anything. There was just about as much crisis inside and outside as you could wish if you like that sort of thing." Now those are the problems he inherited, but I think he has a fantastic way of looking at those problems. And so as I read this section to you, the summary is, listen, we have problems, but they're temporary, and we can fix them. "Economic declines have a way of shaking out the weak ones in business, and we had weaknesses." That's a hell of a statement. Some people cannot see beyond a slump, but I have never yielded to economic pessimism and in times of decline have kept in mind the eventual upturn of the business cycle and the long-range dynamics of growth. Confidence and caution formed my attitude in 1920. We could not control the environment or predicted changes precisely, but we could seek the flexibility to survive fluctuations in business."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I mentioned this because confidence, this is the important -- most important sentence in this whole section. "I mentioned this because confidence is an important element in business. It may, on occasion, make the difference between one man's success and another's failure." I love that. All right. He's going to continue. He says, "In the course of my 20 years or so at Hyatt, I learned to operate a single industrial unit, relatively small in size and with one basic product." So he was comparing and contrasting the experience he had before, and now what he is -- the skills he must learn with this running -- it becomes one of the largest corporations in the world. So he says, "Relatively small size and with one basic product. This unit contained the elementary functions of a manufacturing business, engineering production sales and finance, but it had no organization problems of the General Motors' type." So he's like, "Yes, things changed with scale. Running a tiny bearing company is not the same thing as running General Motors." But in other words, what Sloan is telling us is, again, he had to grow into the leader -- become the leader of GM, just like all of us have to grow into where we are now to where we want to go. All right. Sloan had a lot of centralized power, right? Even though his -- the basis that he builds GM is a series of decentralization. So the operating units are decentralized, but there's tight -- especially tight financial and operating controls in the center, right? So that gave him a lot of centralized power. But he didn't use it. He used it with discretion and here's why in one sentence. "I got better results by selling my ideas than by telling people what to do." That statement was true in 1920s, true when we wrote in 1963, it's still true today, and it will be true in the future. This is a fundamental part of human nature. You've got to tell people why you're doing what you're doing. You have to convince them. Dictators, they don't last long. Okay. So this is really interesting. Sloan is talking about the confusing product line of GM in the early 1920s. He's got a lot of good information in the book on how to think of product lines, especially if you're selling multiple products. And I'll get there in a minute. So he says, "Not only were we not competitive with Ford in the low-price field, no one really was, with the big volume and substantial future growth lay. But in the middle, we were concentrated with duplication."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So maybe Buick had a car that competed with Olds Mobile, and there's other manufacturers that in business that they owned were also making a car. "We did not know what we were trying to do, except to sell cars, which, in a sense, took volume from each other. Some kind of rational policy was called for." When I read that section, I thought of the most famous example and most recent famous example of this is when Steve Jobs came back to Apple for the second time in the late '90s. And he just looked at the product line and said, "What the hell is going on?" He said, "All right, we're going to scrap everything. We're going to focus on 4 products." I think it was consumer laptop and pro laptop and consumer Macintosh and pro Macintosh, if I remember correctly. So Steve -- the reason I bring that up because when Steve Jobs looked at Apple's lineup, Sloan was doing the same thing, and they're both saying, why is this product here? This is like -- this is not a cohesive product strategy. They were maybe accumulated over several years through several different acquisitions, whatever the case may be. But if you're starting fresh, you wouldn't do this, this doesn't make any sense. It's exactly what Sloan is saying here. Now we're talk more about Ford because Ford is -- again, you can't talk about the automobile industry without talking about Ford. It's so hard to understand how dominant Ford was. And we're going to get into some of the numbers, the difference in size of scale. It's just -- it's really baffling. So Ford was so powerful that, of course, it's going to influence GM's strategy in 1920s, right? So at the beginning of 1920s, they're getting trounced by Ford. By the end of the decade, they beat him. Chevy overtakes them. So at this point, they realized, "Hey, we can't beat Ford on production yet." So what -- they -- Sloan does something really smart here. He is like, I'm not going to out forward Ford. So where do we find our edge? And so we start getting into a slight summary of his strategy for competing with Ford.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he says, "With Ford in almost complete possession of the low-price field, it would have been suicidal to compete with him head on. No conceivable amount of capital stored in the United States Treasury could have sustained the losses required to take volume away from him in his own game. So therefore, the strategy we devised was to take a bite from the top of his position conceived as a price class, and in this way, build up Chevrolet volume on a profitable basis." So they're saying, "Hey, he's been dominating with the Model T for a long time. His production numbers are 4x, 5x our amount, which means he can sell far way cheaper than we are. So there's no room at the bottom, can't match them on price. But what Sloan is picking up is like think of the Model T as strictly utility. It is just transportation, bare bones, cheapest can be. He's saying, "With the growing -- the more automobiles that we sell, we're going to see consumer's taste change and the market is going to open up." So it's Cadillac at the higher end of the market, we got Buick a little below that. I was like what if there's like a wedge in between the high end of the market and maybe the $100, $200 more than the Model T, but a lot more value for the money. That is their wedge, okay? So I don't want to go into that in more detail. I just want you to know where we're going. So let me back up, too. There's a lot going on in this paragraph. Let me read it to you first. Let me tell you what my interpretation of it was. "I recognized that my election to the presidency of the corporation was a big responsibility and a business opportunity that comes to few. I resolved in my own mind that I would take any -- I would make any personal sacrifice for the cause, and I would put forth all the energy, experience and knowledge I had to make the corporation an outstanding success. General Motors has been, for me, a dedicated activity ever since perhaps to a fault." Okay. So a few things going on in this paragraph. One, he realizes that the opportunity he is given is rare, smart move. How many people are going to run a company like GM in their lives, very few. Number two, this is also why he is worthy of our time and attention to study because he spent 4.5 decades running one company and 6.5 decades in one industry.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Three, he's talking about his singular focus. He even said perhaps to a fault. Again, one of the most important lessons that I've learned from reading these biographies is that we need to focus. Your attention -- your time and attention is the most valuable assets you have, and allowing people to hijack it or take time away from what you should be focused on. I just read this one -- I just read this interesting excerpt from an interview with Jerry Seinfeld. And let me read it to, it's Jerry Seinfeld on doing good creative work. He says, "Let me tell you why my TV series in the '90s was so good, besides just an inordinate amount of pure good fortune. In most TV series, 50% of the time is spent working on the show, 50% of the time is spent dealing with personality, political and other issues of making something. We spent 99% of our time writing, me and Larry David, the 2 of us, the door was closed. It's closed. Somebody calls, we're not taking the call." You can actually hear his -- like I hear his voice when I'm reading this. "We were going to make this thing funny. That's why the show was so good." And I think for vast majority of people, they're going around, they're giving their craft 20% of their retention, 40%, maybe 50%. And the people we cover, they're giving 99%, 95%, whatever the number is. I'm talking about things that are actually important to business. I'm not telling you to ignore your family or health or other things, definitely not. But as far as not letting things distracted, I cannot, like it's just such an important aspect that you see over and over again through all these biographies. All right. So he starts out describing the principle that his plan for reorganizing GM is anchored to, and he largely builds on this principle for 3 decades.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I would say the vast majority of this book is on this. I'm just going to give you the two cents in summary here. "I approached the matter of organization from the standpoint of a thorough belief in a decentralized organization." Now, again, this sounds -- this may sound commonplace now. It was not common when he's writing these words. Thousands of entrepreneurs and executives managers read this book in the 1960s and moving forward and copied these and made Sloan's ideas kind of the default. "I still am of the same belief that a decentralized organization is the only one that will develop the talent necessary to meet the corporation's big problems." Now it's interesting that he talks so much about decentralization because a large part of the way he organized GM was also through the roles of committees. And this paragraph I'm going to read to you really cleared up for me what Sloan's opinions on the role of committees and individuals were because I was having a hard time reconciling that in my mind. So he says, "I've often been taxed by people who do not know me with being a committee man -- and in a sense, I most certainly am." So committees to make decisions, right? But here's the difference. "I am -- or to at least like think through the ideas. "I have never believed that a group as such could manage anything. A group can make policy, but only individuals can administer policy." So that's the best summary I can give you of the way he thinks about committees. So I'm going to bring in all the experts. I'm going to bring in a bunch of people. We're going to hash things out. We're going to make a decision, but one person has got to be responsible to administer that policy. Now he's going to describe more of the problems he had to deal with. This is one of the most insane things I learned in the book. This is on the need for cash control. And my jaw dropped. So he says, "The way cash" -- and he's talking about pre -- like as he's taking over the company. "The way cash was handled at that time is almost unbelievable." Now the idea that he uses the word unbelievable, this is about as animated as you're going to find Sloan in his writing. He's like a very serious person. That's like him using a bunch of curse words, like he does not write like that.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this is -- and I understand why he starts this section with saying this is almost unbelievable. He says, "Each division controlled its own cash, depositing all receipts in its own accounts and paying all bills in the same account." So when he says division, he means different company, right? GM is a collection of people of car manufacturers. So Buick has a different account, Cadillac has a different account, all the different companies, and all of them are separate. "Since only divisions sold products, none of the cash receipts flowed directly to the corporation itself. We had no effective" -- so that's really bizarre, right, but it gets way, way crazier. "We had no effective procedure for getting cash from the points where we happen to have some to the points where we happen to need some. When the corporation, as an operating company, had to pay dividends and taxes and such items as rents, salaries and other expenses, the usual procedure was for the treasurer to request cash from the divisions," it gives an example of how insane this procedure was.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"I remember that Buick, for example, at the time was very low to give up its cash." That's the cash cow of the early GM, by the way. "This profitable division was the most prolific source of cash for the corporation and long experience had made Buick's financial staff highly adept at delaying its report of the cash they had on hand." So Buick is hiding how much money they have from GM. "Buick made a practice of maintaining large cash balances in its factory sales branches. The amount" this doesn't make any sense. "The amounts of these balances were not ascertainable at headquarters." So how much money does Buick have? And in turn, how much does GM have? I don't know. No idea. "When the corporation needed cash, the treasurer would try to guess how much Buick actually had and how much of it he could probably get from them." So now he doesn't know how much they have. He doesn't know how much they're willing to give them. What is happening here? "Then he would have to go to Flint" Flint Michigan "discuss whatever other questions might be outstanding between Buick and headquarters, and at last casually bring up the subject of cash." What is happening here. "Buick's financial people would invariably express surprise at the size of the treasury's request and would try to resist the transfer of such a large amount.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Naturally, this cat-and-mouse game did not result in the most efficient utilization of funds." That's one of the crazy things I've ever read. So Sloan's solution to this, I'm not going to belabor the point, he centralized the cash controls. This is Sloan's summary of the effectiveness of the centralized financial controls that he put into place. "The need for financial controls grew out of a crisis. Controls were brought in to ensure that the crisis did not recur. Their effectiveness was demonstrated particularly in the depression year in 1932. The corporation's unit volume in that year was 50% less than that of 1931, and 72% below the high of 1929." That is insane how giant the great depression was. Think about that. You're down -- in 3 years, you're down 72%. And in one in -- was that 1 year? Yes. In 1 year, you're down 50%. "But the corporation was not demoralized as it had been in 1920, and it had stayed in the black. Not many corporations did as well." During this time, though, I'm going to get back to the effects of the great depression because I find it fascinating. But I really like how Sloan was aware. This is Sloan telling us it's important to understand what is influencing your growth or decline. Some of which is under your control and some of which is out of your control. Things happen to be going good in the early 1920s for GM, but it's not because they were extremely disorganized. They were still trying to fix things and yet their sales are going through the roof. It had nothing to do with what they were doing. He says "By the middle of 1920, General Motors had a company -- had accomplished some things. But apart from survival and reorganization, they," meaning our accomplishments "were more in the realm of the mind than of reality that our volume of business had increased after the slump of 1921 could be attributed less to our own wits than through the improvement in the general economy and the rising demand for automobiles." They were just bailed out because of the industry they were in was growing rapidly.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Let me go back to this point, though, because he said something here that I think can be applied to tons of opportunities today. It's actually how to find an opportunity today, okay? He's summarizing that weird sentence. "A case of trying to widen a niche." Now I love that sentence. What -- now the reason I love this is because I think it's a prompt for our thinking. What can this strategy be used for today? What niche that's out there can be widened? We know niches can be widened, right? And the widening of the niche can open up a gigantic opportunity for you because that's exactly we have in Chevrolet. So where can be -- can't do it in automobiles today, maybe you can, but it's a lot more difficult. But there's other different domains. So think about whatever it is you're doing like. There's going to be niche that you're going to focus on. Is there another one that's right next to it or right above it or right below it, that could be widened. It's a really fascinating like the way to think. That was all in the beginning, despite the completeness of the plan, that was all saying this how we were thinking about. "Yes, we did not see the movement, especially the interaction of these elements in the whole automobile market, as I can see it looking back -- looking -- as I can see today looking back. We saw them as uncertainties, unknowns, and trends." Okay, another weird sentence there. His main point is you won't have all the information that you need before you act. You have to use your best judgment. He is like it's really clear as I look back and can see how this fits into place. But at the time, we knew it was uncertain unknown, and we're just hoping that this trend played out into our advantage, and it did. Now he goes into specifically how this strategy, which started in the early 1920s did not start to yield dividends for GM until the mid-1920s. So Sloan right here, let me read this to you first.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Ford sales held even in 1925 with a volume of about 2 million cars." So he is selling 2 million cars, okay? "But since the market as a whole in that year rose substantially, Ford's share declined -- market share declined from 54% to 45%. That was a sign of danger, if Mr. Ford had chosen to read it. Yet, he still held almost 70% of the low-price field." So what's happening here? Sloan is pointing out what most people consider to be Henry Ford single biggest mistake. But he's also bringing up inadvertently why he was -- why Ford was so likely to make that mistake. We are rationalizing creatures. We are not rational ones. It's an important distinction. It's very hard. He's been dominating the entire industry. He had 54% of all cars. He's selling 2 million cars a year doing it his way. He held 70% specifically of a market at the low price. It's going to be very hard when you sold 13 -- maybe 13 million of the 15 million Model Ts you're going to sell to think that you're seeing any signs of danger because you've been dominating for so long. We are very prone to make the same mistake and continue to make mistakes in the future continuing. This is a really interesting strategy -- part of your strategy. I want to bring to your attention. "Chevrolet's internal statement of policy at the time was that it was our objective to get a public reputation for giving more for the dollar than Ford. So what I mean by interesting strategy." We can't beat him on price. He's never going to try to lower -- to build a Chevrolet that's cheaper than the Model T. But we can beat them on value per dollar and we can start educating the public and the consumers of thinking in those terms. Yes, you might buy a Model T at $200 less than us or $150 less than us. But look what you get if you increase by $150 or $200, where the number is, you got a hell of a lot more value. And if you divide that value by your actual dollar, the Chevy is a better deal. That's a really good way to attack. All right. So this is more on the strategy, working on Chevrolet overtaking Ford.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And remember, as we go through this, this is why, again, you have to give Billy Durant so much respect. He founded Chevrolet, he founds GM, Frigidaire, Chevrolet. The guy should not have died in impoverished. He should not have died in -- working in a bowling alley. I guess he was working in a bowling alley right before he died. That happened a few years later, but you know what I'm saying here. He was -- I just -- I can't get over the amount of companies that he founded and not only how important they went to being half a decade to a decade after he left the company. So he says, "the old master" meaning Ford "had failed to master change." Don't ask me why. It was not difficult to see in 1925, 1926 that Chevrolet was closing in on Ford. So let's go through these numbers here, okay. 1925, Chevy had, let's call it, 0.5 million sales, Ford did 2 million sales. The next year, Chevy is up to almost 700,000 sales, Ford is down 0.5 million to 1.5 million. His precious volume, which is the foundation of his position was fast disappearing. He cannot continue losing sales and maintain his profits. And so for market reasons, the Model T fell. So he used the word market reasons. Really, customers -- what they wanted was changing. And GM -- and this is where Billy Durant is now like he had this idea from the very beginning. I'm going to build a low-price car and I'm going to build a really expensive car and every single price in between. I'm going -- that's why I'm going to dominate the automobile market because I'm going to have whatever you want; you want a low-price car I got you there. You want middle price, I got you there. You want high, I got you there. You want something between middle and high, I got you there. He just -- unfortunately, again, Billy Durant came up with the idea, Sloan perfected it, just continue -- he cannot continue losing sales and maintain his profits. I read that that part.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"And yet not many observers -- old master had -- remember, Ford has complete control of his company. So he can do something like this. "And yet not many observers expected so catastrophic and almost whimsical a fall as Mr. Ford chose to take in May 1927 when he shut down his great plan completely and kept it shut down for nearly a year to retool, leaving the field to Chevrolet unopposed. Mr. Ford regained sales leadership again in 1929, 1930, and 1935. But speaking in terms of generalities, he had lost the lead to General Motors. Mr. Ford, who had so many brilliant insights in the early years and he definitely did. Like I said before, I'd say in some hypothetical world, you can only learn about entrepreneurship or making a product or building a business or mastering your craft from one person." Not many people throughout history that you put above Mr. Ford, you put above Henry Ford. There's other people definitely with them, but he's definitely in that category. He had some brilliant insights. So he says "Mr. Ford, who had so many brilliant insights since earlier years, seemed never to understand how completely the market had changed from the one in which he made his name and to one in which he was accustomed." All right. Now let's go back to the great depression because I find it fascinating. This is effect of a great depression on a GM. It's almost unbelievable. "Thanks to the financial and operating controls, the development which I described in earlier chapters, General Motors did not approach disaster as it had in the 1920 to 1921 slump, even though the economic collapse was much greater" Right? "We made an orderly step-by-step retreat in all matters, including wage and salary reductions. Sales dropped to 526,000 in 1932. They were 2 million in 1929. It's about a tremendous drop of 72% when you consider" He's talking about the drop of 72% is even more tremendous "when you consider that many expenses that automobile manufacture has are fixed."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Now here's a crazy thing. "Our profits dropped from $250 million in 1929 to $165,000 in 1932. $250 million to $165,000, yet still in the black, thanks mainly to our financial control procedures." I'm pretty sure the entire multiple decade reign of Alfred Sloan, they never had a loss in a year, almost positive. Okay. So what happens in a severe economic contraction, let's not just think about GM in particular, let's think of like because this trend happens over and over again, we might be going through a severe economic contraction at the time I'm recording this. More people opt for the cheaper product and the middle is hollowed out. Now sometimes you see like extremely expensive ultra-luxury products. They sometimes are able to maintain their position, but we know what happens in almost every financial crisis happen in a Great Depression. I'm going to give you the numbers for GM here. The middle is gone, right? And so at the bottom, you might be able to maintain your business there. All right. he says, "The situation was this. In the automobile market of 1933, the low-price group grew relatively" remember, sales were down, but how many -- what percentage of your customers are going now for your lower price cars "Grew relatively to encompass 73% of the industry's unit car sales compared with 52% in 1926." So everybody is out of work, they're making less money, they all gravitated towards a lower price, right? "This meant -- now here's a problem for GM -- this meant for the old car line -- meaning their product line. Remember, I said he thinks of his product line as a pyramid, which Chevy as a base "that we would have 4 lines in 20% of the market and one line in 73% of the market."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So in other words, the company that -- and this is Durant's strategy. He's like, "I'm starting Chevy to attack Ford because I think the greatest opportunity is the lower end of the market, right?" 1933, so 13 years after he's kicked out, Chevy saves GM's a**, 73% of their sales is coming from 1 of their 5 brands. That's amazing. He's got a really interesting point here. So think about this after decades of intense competition, customers have more variety, right? And so they start making purchase decisions based on features they value that you might not be able to predict. This is why that pyramid strategy is so important. They may be picking something just on a matter of taste and everybody has different tastes. So let me read this, and let me tell you how it ties into something else we learned. "My general point, I believe, was valid, namely that selling had begun to focus on personal preferences of the consumer, especially matters of style, people like different things. Many people do not want to have exactly the same thing that their neighbor has. The design of any car is an artistic and engineering compromise. No car can embrace all the desirable features" and this is what he has to deal with "relatively inconsequential features often influence sales." So what is he really saying? In other words, you don't have to be the best. You just have to be different. And another way to think about this is David Ogilvy. He had this idea in his book Ogilvy On Advertising, which I'd pick up immediately, if you haven't, of his idea of a positively good product, which is a completely different way to think about competing with other people. He says and let me read from that book. "In the past, just about every other advertiser has assumed that in order to sell his goods he has to convince consumers that his product is superior to his competitors."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But Sloan is just telling us there's no such thing as a superior car because tastes are so varied. The market has been. You have all -- the market's wide open now, and you've had -- he says a decade -- at that point 2.5 decades of intense competition of people trying to find different wedges, different ways, different things that they can build in their car that give them an advantage, right? So he says, "he had to convince consumers that his product is superior to its competitors. This may not be necessary. It may be sufficient to convince consumers that your product is positively good." I love this idea. Think -- tell customers why your product is positively good, he continues. "If the consumer feel certain that your product is good and feels uncertain about your competitors, he will buy yours. If you and your competitors all make excellent products, don't try to imply that your product is better. Just say what's good about your products and do a cleaner, more honest and more informative job of saying it. Sales will swing to the marketer who does the best job of creating confidence that his product is positively good." This is fantastic. Now towards the end of the book, it was very interesting because he has this idea when he's a younger man, building Hyatt Roller Bearing. And it doesn't really -- there's nothing that he experiences in his career that causes him to think that he's wrong. In fact, he sees the experience of others and think he's correct. So this is Sloan on debt. "The strategic question in industrial finance, assuming you have something to work with in the way of a going business, is how to optimize its elements. The latitude for opinion, or subjective judgment, here is wide. But I think it would generally agree that in principle, debt enhances the return on the stockholder investment while at the same time increasing the risk involved."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it's what he's saying, debt fragilizes. "It would be agreed I think..." again, debt can increase your investment in good times, but in bad times, he's going to talk about what happens. "I think it would be agreed I think that Mr. Durant had a strong desire to spend and had little inhibition about debt." Remember, he's constantly comparing and contrasting what he feels Durant did wrong, and he did correct. "Even so, the expansion of 1918 and 1920 might have worked without crisis, if it had been assisted by management and financial controls and you might have been able to pull it off if you ran any company a little better. But in your personal life, that wasn't the case. And his personal affairs was obvious debt -- it was obviously debt that had brought disaster to Mr. Durant in the economic slump of 1920." This is a hell of a statement here. So much for that. "It is equally evident that from 1921 to 1946, the corporation avoided long-term debt." What is he saying? "I avoided long-term debt. I myself had feelings against debt, perhaps because of what I had seen of it in my experience. And yet I cannot really say that we had an anti-debt policy in that period, the facts show that we were in general, able to do without it." So we never, never exposed to say we're not going to use debt, but our financial performance was so great that we didn't need debt. I guess I just ran over my point here. "In other words, we paid off and grew without debt, except for bank loans during the short period in 1920." Now he's going to describe the early days of the automobile industry. And this is a really important point -- a really interesting point that I don't even know if he meant to make. Let me read this section to you first. "During the early years of the automobile industry, the immediate goal of the engineers and inventors was simply reliability - to get a car to go somewhere and come back under its own power" more transportation utility, right? "Many bright automotive ideas ended with a horse, a towline and laughter.

Although progress was expensive, American motorists cheerfully paid the bills for it, and their enthusiasm for individual transportation, they bought the cars, reliable or unreliable, and thus provided the source of a substantial portion of the risk capital for experimentation and production. Not many industries have been so well favored by their customers." This is -- the reason I say it's an important point. What is he saying, "the desire for individual transportation was so great that customers are willing to finance it." So what other opportunities like that today? I can't think of any. May be interesting if -- like to continue that line of thought. What is something that's so difficult to do, but if created customers will provide money for it hand over fist like they did in the early automobile industry, very rare, but very interesting. Another main idea, I love Sloan has an entire chapter on change, which, again, I think most people are afraid of, which is weird because it's the only thing -- one of the only constants in life is change. And I covered some of his ideas unchanged last week, so I'm not going to cover that again, but I love this idea and you could be summarizing with you can't be rigid. Building businesses, doing all the stuff that Sloan and others are doing. These are complex adaptive systems. Life is a complex adaptive system. It's going to change. You can't just be stuck in your ways. "Above all, an organization must have" so he's talking about an organization, you could even bring that on a personal level, right? "Above all, the organization must adapt to great changes in the market. You could say above all, an individual must adapt to great changes in their environment." Same thing. Statement is still true. "Any rigidity by an automobile manufacturer, no matter how large or well-established is severely penalized in the market.

As we have seen was the case with Mr. Ford in the 1920s when he stayed too long with his old and once dominant successful concept of the business. We had a different concept of the business, which we put into competition with his. It could have happened that he was right. As it happened, though, our concept was more in accord with the economy, the progress of the automobile, and the changing interest and taste of consumers." And finally, this is one of my favorite paragraphs in the book and a great place to close. "Each new generation must meet new challenges in the automotive market and the general administration of the enterprise and in the involvement of the corporation in a changing world. For the present management, the work is only beginning. Some of their problems are similar to those I met in my time. Some are problems I never dreamed of, but the work of creating goes on." All right. That is 122 books done, 1,000 to go. I'll leave a link in the show notes. If you buy the book using the link, you'll be supporting the podcast at the same time, and I'll talk to you again soon.

I don't think you have to listen to the Quentin Tarantino episode or the Steven Spielberg episode before you listen to this episode on George Lucas. But if you haven't listened to them, I would listen to them after you listen to this episode because you're going to see so much similarities in how they approach their work. I talked about last week how Spielberg would watch and rewatch movies that he loved. Decades later, entire scenes from those movies would appear in his own movies. Tarantino do the exact same thing. George Lucas talks about doing this. You're going to hear him being addicted to reading biographies, studying history, reading science fiction. A lot of the stuff that he was learning as a young person, he would use a decade later. And the influences that he used to build Star Wars, which is obviously the cornerstone of his multibillion-dollar empire, have been well-documented. And you see the exact same thing with company builders. This is just like Edwin Land's ideas that show up in Steve Jobs' companies and products. It's just like Sam Walton's ideas showing up in Jeff Bezos' companies and products. It's just like Henry Singleton's ideas showing up in how Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger build Berkshire Hathaway. Charlie Munger said Henry Singleton was the smartest person that he ever met. Warren Buffett said it was a crime that business schools didn't study him. And so I go back and start reading about Henry Singleton and you realize, "Oh, wow, all these ideas I was attributing to Munger and Buffett actually originated with Singleton." And that is a main theme that reappears over and over again for anybody that gets to the top of their profession. Anybody who becomes great with what they do is seeped, they are all seeped in the history of their industry. They talk about these ideas over and over again. They don't just read a book one time. They don't just watch a movie one time. They don't just have one conversation. They do it over and over and over again. That is why if you haven't done so already, I highly recommend that you subscribe to Founders Notes. For six years, I've been cataloging all of my notes, all of my highlights for every single book that I've read for the podcast, and it blew my mind because that's exactly what Quentin Tarantino did. He would keep scrapbooks, make notes, and he actually kept files on index cards of every single movie and what he wanted to remember about the movie, for every single movie he's ever watched. And then because he cataloged all those ideas, he was able to use them in future movies. And so now you're able to read now by signing up for Founders Notes.

When you get a subscription, you get access to all my notes, all my highlights, transcripts for every single episode. You can search by keyword, by person, by subject. It's this giant database of the collective knowledge of history's greatest entrepreneurs. You can also read all of my notes and highlights by book. You can have all of my notes and highlights presented to you in a random order on the highlights feed. I've been searching by keyword. I've been rereading my highlights by book, and I've been rereading my highlights in random order on the highlight feed for years. I built this tool for me. I had this for half a decade before anybody else had access to it. I literally could not make the podcast without this tool. And now I've added a new feature that I'm super excited about that may have made it 1,000 times more valuable. It's actually called SAGE. It is the Founders Notes AI, and the name actually came because there's a bunch of existing Founders Notes subscribers. They were beta testing this feature for me. And one of them e-mailed me because he heard some of the names, it's like, this feature is incredible, but I can't figure out what to name it. And he said that none of the names were good enough because they don't actually describe what the feature does, and he said, you should call it SAGE, and he sent me the definition of SAGE. SAGE is a profoundly wise person that is often looked to for guidance and advice. And that's exactly what SAGE does. It's like search on steroids. You can ask it a question, and it will search every single note, every single highlight, every single transcript, meaning every single word I've ever uttered on this podcast and it will start making connections. It's been making connections that I've even missed. And so I mentioned last week after I relistened to the Steven Spielberg episode, I was asking SAGE, I was like, what are the most important ideas to learn from Steven Spielberg? And within 20 to 30 seconds, it gives me this outline of the Top 9, what it feels is the Top 9 most important lessons from Steven Spielberg. Now the interesting part is if you press on expand, it actually tells you what it searched to come up with the answer. So you could just read the outline, or if you choose to, you can go deeper and see what it actually fetched and what it searched to come up with the answer. And of course, it's going to search the Steven Spielberg episode because I've done that episode a few years ago. But what is fascinating is it also included ideas when I mentioned Steven Spielberg on a Steve Jobs episode, when I mentioned Spielberg on the Christopher Nolan and the James Cameron episode.

It pulled an idea from Spielberg that I mentioned in an episode on Pixar. Its memory far exceeds mine. And so I really do believe a subscription to Founders Notes is the perfect companion. If you're going to invest tens of hours, dozens of hours, have hundreds of -- so there's people who have listened to hundreds of hours listening to this podcast. Founders Notes and SAGE, in particular, is the tool that I hope you can dense and clarify the collective knowledge of history's greatest founders, so then you can use their ideas in your work, just like Bezos used Walton's ideas, just like Jobs used Land's ideas, just like Spielberg and Tarantino and Lucas used past filmmakers and everything they read, all the ideas they derive from that in their work. I highly recommend getting a subscription, and you can do that by going to foundersnotes.com, that is Founders with an s just like the podcast, foundersnotes.com. I'll also leave a link down below on the show notes. I appreciate the support, and I hope you enjoy this episode on George Lucas. George Lucas unapologetically invested in what he believed in the most, himself. As a result, the film empire that he created would empower not just him but other filmmakers to produce movies exactly as they envision them, without a studio imposing its own priorities, complaining about budgets or micromanaging the process. George Lucas, the small-town son of the owner of a stationary store, had said no to the family business and then built a cinematic empire based on his own uncompromising vision of the film industry, not as it was but as he thought it should be. Much of that vision lay in the possibilities presented by new technology, technology that Lucas developed with his own money. I can't help feeling that George Lucas has never been fully appreciated by the industry for his remarkable innovations. The Director Peter Jackson once said, "George Lucas is the Thomas Edison of the modern film industry," but George Lucas knew what he had done. He knew his place, and he seemed comfortable with it. When asked by interviewer Charlie Rose what he thought the first line of his obituary might say, Lucas gave perhaps the best summation of his lengthy career in two single syllable words. His answer, "I tried." George Lucas As a "Juvenile Delinquent"

That was an excerpt from the book that I'm going to talk about today, which is George Lucas: A Life, and it's written by Brian Jay Jones. Brian Jay Jones writes excellent biographies. He wrote this one. I read his biography on Dr. Seuss, which was excellent, and he also wrote an incredible biography on Jim Henson. So I originally read this book like seven years ago. It was Episode 35. And there are some ideas in it that I've never forgotten. That sentence where it's like he unapologetically invested in what he believed in most, himself is my favorite sentence in the entire book. And I also think that concept, investing in yourself, is the concrete and the foundation of his empire, if you will. So I want to go to the beginning, which is really fascinating because the book is going to talk a lot about his childhood, but it doesn't start there. It opens up right in the middle of him shooting Star Wars. And I think his despair and depression and struggle that's going on, you see this a lot, not only with founder biographies that you and I talk about, but especially with the filmmaker biographies. Tarantino talks about this. Christopher Nolan talks about this. James Cameron talks about this. Steven Spielberg talks about this. You'll see this in George Lucas. It is very hard to understand at the time you're doing something how it's actually going to turn out and how impactful it was. He had no idea. There's no possible way when George Lucas started working on Star Wars that he could have predicted the impact that those movies would have on the world and then, of course, the influence and control it had over the building of his business. And thinking about how difficult this movie was to make is fascinating to think about, but what I'm really interested is how this experience influences this intense desire for control and independence. That is the main theme of Lucas' life and career. So he says, "The shoot was a disaster from the beginning. I was very depressed about the whole thing."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

His misery was due partly to the fact that he felt he had already lost control of his film. The executives at 20th Century Fox had nickel and dimed him every step of the way. They would deny him the money that he needed to ensure that everything worked. The people at Fox were also skeptical. Science fiction, they said, was a dead genre. And they were actually right about that. At this time in history, science fiction in the films was a dead genre. The difference was you needed the right people to show up. And those people happen to be George Lucas and his lifelong friend, Steven Spielberg. Steven Spielberg makes Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Lucas, of course, made Star Wars. Go back to Lucas, "It was very, very difficult to get things to work. Everything was a prototype. We had to build this, and we had to build it with no money, but we had to make this work." The problem is nothing really worked as we wanted. Lucas vowed he would never cede control over his film to executives at the studios again. And something he would repeat over and over again is like, "What do they actually know about film making? They've never made a film." But they would come down and talk to him and tell him, this is how you should make the movie. And he says, "They decided they know more about making movies than directors." And here's the problem. You can't fight them because they've got the money. And so Lucas vowed one thing. If Star Wars worked out, one thing he would have to change for sure. He would control the money. Back to Lucas, "I was seriously, seriously depressed at this point because nothing had gone right. Everything was screwed up. I was desperately unhappy." A little more than a year before it was scheduled to hit theaters, Star Wars was a mess and the movie was going to be terrible. Lucas was certain of it. And I think that's a really important place to start when you analyze the career of George Lucas. The depth of his depression is going to influence all the decisions he's going to make. And in turn, the success of those decisions that he makes, makes him a multi, multi, multibillionaire. So I want to touch on a few things in his childhood because I think it would give us, you and I, a better understanding of just really why he ran the business the way he did.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He was the sole shareholder, the only shareholder in Lucasfilm when he sells it to Disney for over $4 billion. And he's got this, I would say, juvenile delinquent streak in him since he was a very young boy. A lot of this came out of this kind of butting heads or fighting that he would have with his father because Lucas is kind of like a hippie or a rebel and his dad's the exact opposite of that. So his dad is actually George Lucas Sr. And so George Lucas Jr. describes his dad as a very old-fashioned kind of guy. He was a kind of classic small-town businessman that you would see in a movie. He owned a stationary store. And Lucas said later in interviews that he was -- he would remember being very, very angry at his father for most of his childhood. And I think the main reason of that is because his dad was intent on controlling him. It's something else that Lucas never had that he looked for his entire life. He really talks about the importance of mentorship, but he never had an older brother. And so throughout his entire career, you see him trying to attach himself to a slightly older, almost like bigger brother figure, and he talks about why this was so important. He said, "That's one of the ways that you learn. You attach yourself to somebody older and wiser than you. You learn everything they have to teach, and then you move on to your own accomplishments." And so another way that George Lucas was searching for a mentorship was not only for like older brother figures, but also through books. He was never very good in school, but he loved to read. I got to the section of the book, and it reminded me of, I saw this interview, that's pretty incredible. All the way back in 2012, it's with Elon Musk and he's being interviewed by this guy name Kevin Rose. I will grab the link from YouTube and put in the show notes, in case you want to watch it, highly recommend you do. Because it takes place on like the Tesla, the factory floor of Tesla back when I think they only had one model in production. It was like the early Model S was in production.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But Kevin was asking Elon, he was like trying to figure like how did you do all this? You immigrated from Canada. You didn't have a lot of money. You moved to California. You started your first company when you were just in your early 20s. And he was like, "Well, how did you learn how to start a company?" The question from Kevin to Elon was, "Did you read a lot of business books?" And his answer actually had a huge influence on my desire and my dedication to making this podcast. And because Elon said, "No, I didn't read business books. I read biographies and autobiographies. I thought they were helpful," and then he went on to say that this was a way to develop mentors in a historical context. And you see that with a very young George Lucas. He talks about he didn't like school, but he loved reading, and he amassed this enormous collection of these things called Landmark Books, which is a series of biographies written for young readers. And reflecting on this time in his life, George Lucas says, I was addicted to those. It started me on a lifelong love of history. And as a kid, I spent a lot of time trying to relate the past to the present. And just like everybody else that gets to the top of their profession, Lucas references and uses that learning from history is a form of leverage. He'll talk about, I watched this interview with him and Christopher Nolan that took place probably a decade ago. And in that, Lucas is just talking about the fact that all this reading and studying of history that he was doing as a kid influenced the storyline for Star Wars. And then Lucas continues to use the entire world and all of its experiences is like this giant classroom. And so he actually gets -- this is hilarious. You know what fictional character is going to have a huge influence on the way that Lucas builds his empire and thinks about building his business? Scrooge McDuck. I remember watching Scrooge McDuck in DuckTales when I was a kid. I didn't even know that it was around when Lucas was a kid. And so listen to the lessons he draws from watching Scrooge McDuck, which is the money-hoarding, globetrotting uncle of Donald Duck, right? And so it says, "Lucas was fascinated not only by Scrooge's exploits, but also by his conniving capitalist ways. Work smarter, not harder was Scrooge's motto, and yet his stories were full of inventive schemes that more often than not made him richer and even more successful."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

In Scrooge's world, hard work paid off but so did cleverness and the desire to do something in a way no one had ever thought of before. Think of it, come on. Think about the life and career of George Lucas, the desire to do something in a way that no one had ever thought of before. That is exactly Lucas' approach to the filmmaking industry. Remember moviemaking had been around for four or five decades before Lucas came along. Think about why Peter Jackson said, "Hey, this guy is the Thomas Edison of our industry." You know what, I wasn't even thinking about going here. I was going to talk to you about this later, but I'm going to jump ahead because I think it's one of the most important ideas in the book, and I might repeat this in the future. But they talked about the fact that he was so dissatisfied with that he could not make the vision in his head real. The computer graphics weren't there. The special effects weren't there. So he was like, "What's the solution? I'm going to start my own company. I have to create the technology that I want to see in the world just so I can make the movies look how I want them to look." And so he founds this company called Industrial Light & Magic, which absolutely dominates in special effects for a couple of decades. Ron Howard has this excellent quote later in the book, right, talking about the fact that, "Who the hell would do something like that?" And I think he summarizes it better than I ever could. He goes, "How many people think the solution to gaining quality control, improving physical responsibility and stimulating technological innovation is to start their own special effects company?," Ron Howard said admiringly, but that's what George did. Back to Scrooge McDuck, in Scrooge's world, hard work paid off. But so did cleverness and the desire to do something in a way no one had ever thought of before. Scrooge's ethic reflected honor, honesty and allowing other people to believe in their own ideas, not trying to force everyone into one form, which is, I think, exactly how we described what his dad was trying to do to him. His dad was trying to make another him and George is like, "But I'm not the same as you. I want to live life on my terms."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The lessons Lucas learned from Uncle Scrooge would shape the kind of businessman he would become in the future, conservative and driven, believing strongly in his own vision and pursuing it aggressively. Let's go back to more of his juvenile delinquent ways. As his grade suffered, Lucas began to look more and more like the juvenile delinquent his teachers were already convinced that he was. One of my favorite lines ever describing founder mentality in entrepreneurs comes from Yvon Chouinard, who is the founder of Patagonia. He says, if you want to understand the entrepreneur, study the juvenile delinquent. The delinquent is saying with his actions, this sucks, I'm going to do my own thing. His grades were so bad, his dad was convinced that he was going to be a loser. Lucas thought his father's lack of interest in him was typical, and it was probably understandable. I was a hellraiser and I didn't do very well in school. My father wrote me off, and then it doesn't help that he's not doing well at school, doesn't really have a direction in what he wants to do in life yet. And so he goes and briefly works for his dad at the stationary store. This, he doesn't last long. He quits and then him and his dad get back into this argument. And so this is Lucas' description of that. I get really mad at my father, and I told him, "I'll never work in a job where I have to do the same thing over and over again every day." His father responded. You'll be back in a few years. I'll never be back, Lucas said. As a matter of fact, I'm going to be a millionaire before I'm 30. And that is one of the smartest insights that a young George Lucas has ever had, the fact that he realized that you need to make money, not to buy a bunch of useless s_*_, but to actually buy your own freedom. And that's exactly what he uses his money for. So it's almost like a contrast embedded in one person because he will bet literally the house, which he does multiple times on the success of one movie, but he's unbelievably fiscally conservative with the way he runs his business. And that fiscal conservatism actually breaks up. He has like co-founder break-ups with Francis Ford Coppola because Coppola was essentially the exact opposite.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

George Lucas was always very, very concerned about protecting his downside because all he wanted to do is never jeopardize anything that would cause him to relinquish his freedom over what he worked on. You could think of George Lucas's constant invention and vertical integration is just a way, another form of control and that control to make sure that no one else can ever, ever tell him what to do. And so he gets to college, he's like, "I have no idea what I want to do." So he just goes to like a little junior college, a little community college. And then he realized he knew he is like, "I'm not stupid." Remember the Tarantino episode, I don't know if I should back up, why am I doing like Lucas right now? I think if you re-listen to the Spielberg episode I just republished a couple of days ago and then Tarantino, I think this line to what I'm doing right now, Tarantino studied, there are about 10 that came about 10 to 15 years before he did. Tarantino studied Spielberg and Lucas. All the movie brats, which all get into like the rest of these guys there's essentially like these filmmaking geniuses that all met in the early 20s. And in many cases, they're 70, 80 years old today, and they're still friends. But I find this fascinating because Tarantino studied Spielberg and Lucas. Spielberg and Lucas studied Walt Disney. Walt Disney is the next episode. I'm reading this 700-page biography of now. So it's taken me a long time. This book that is in my hand is a monster, over 500 pages. I have the hard cover version, and it took me over 30 hours to read and research and really think about before I sit down and talk to you today. So the connection to what's happening in Lucas' life is very similar to Tarantino's. Not great in school, but clearly not dumb. He just doesn't like other people telling him what he should study. Tarantino was the same way. George Lucas's Foray Into Film So he gets to junior college. And now college is the first time he actually pick his classes. And so once he's in control of his own curriculum, he becomes a phenomenal student. And so once it's time to be done with junior college, he's got to figure out like where do I transfer and what am I going to study? And this conversation with his dad actually changes the trajectory of his life forever because Lucas is like "I'm going to go to art school."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

His dad is like this old school, 1950s super conservative American business man. He's like, there's no way in hell that my son, like you're going to go to art school, there's no way in hell, I'm paying for it. And he told his son, like there's no way you're going to make money, you can't do that. And so one of Lucas' friends says, "Hey, why don't you -- if you're not going to go to arts school, take a look at USC, University of Southern California has this new cinematography school." And keep in mind, this is the mid-1960s. There's not many film schools in the United States. And so this is why Tarantino last week in his book would talk about the movie brats. He said they love movies, they dreamed of movies, and they even received degrees in movies back when that was a dubious major. And Lucas talks about this like it was embarrassing. Other people were like, you're going to a film school, they didn't even call it a film school, they call it cinematography school. "Like what the hell is this?" and he says, "I lost a lot of face." The idea of going into film was a really goofy idea at the time. But what was fascinating is his dad's like there's no way in hell, I'm playing for art school, then he was impressed that his son got accepted in the USC and he didn't understand. They said the school of cinema or cinematography, he didn't understand that it was his way of getting to a form of art school. And so his dad agrees to help him out pay his tuition and help him get housing. And the reason I say that decision changed the trajectory of George Lucas' life is because that's when he meets essentially just a collection of filmmakers who are all obsessed with movies, they're all young, and they wind up helping each other for decades. It's almost like the island of misfit toys because before this, it says, for many of them, it was the first time they had a click of their own, a gathering place where they could talk about their interest, movies without eye rolling from the other cool kids. For many reality finally began when they entered film school. Lucas knew that he had found his way before he wasn't sure, obviously in the college he had all these other interests. And he's like, "Oh, wait, this is it." I was sort of floundering for something. "And when I finally discovered film, I really fell madly in love with it. I ate it. I slept it 24 hours a day. There was no going back after that." That is a direct quote from George Lucas. There was no going back after that.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He was fascinating. I'm going to put this book down, picking up the Steven Spielberg book that I republished last week. That book is 25 years old, maybe. This book is 25 years old. Listen to how Steven Spielberg describes, he uses the exact same language. This is what Spielberg said, "Making movies grows on you. You can't shake it. I like directing above all. All I know for sure is I've gone too far to back out now. There is no going back." They both discovered what they're going to do. Now this is the fascinating part because this turns into the USC Mafia, Spielberg is part of that, even though he didn't go to USC. You're talking about a group of super talented filmmakers and a lot of them come out to California, even though they called the USC Mafia, some of them like Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone, they went to NYU, Brian De Palma went to Colombia. Francis Ford Coppola was at UCLA, Spielberg is on the lot getting his own curriculum, I think, at Universal or yes, it was at Universal. Lucas to be one of a group of highly motivated and young filmmakers. They were all friends who would have a lasting impact on film and culture. This is another example that relationships around the world. You see it over and over again in these books, so important to develop relationships with other people that are just like you and even if you're -- they don't look at themselves as competitors. They tend to compete, but they also collaborate, but they all need each other because they're trying to break into a system that is closed. At this point in history, unless you're part of a union, unless you already know somebody in the industry, you're not breaking it even with a film degree. It's yet another illustration of one of my favorite concepts from Game of Thrones, where they said those on the margins often come to control the center. At this time, Spielberg, Scorsese, De Palma, Coppola, Lucas, they are on the margin. The center is controlled by these old school conservative studios that are locking all these young people out. It was unheard of to have a director in their 20s. And yet this network that they're building and the talent that they have for their craft, like those on the margins often come to control the center. They become the center. Now this is really fascinating because when I had dinner with Charlie Munger, this is the advice that he gave us.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I'll get there in one second. So it talks about -- they refer to themselves as the mafia, right? That would end up being a more appropriate designation as they were all regularly hire, fire and conspire with one another on countless projects over the next five decades, putting together a kind of system of their own. Munger talked about the importance. I mean he didn't use the word relationships from the world, that's the maximum that I put on it. But he talked about is exactly what him and Buffett did. I think he was 35 when he met Buffett, Buffett was about 28, 29 something like that. Each talked over and over again, the importance of -- the advice he gave was like you have to develop relationships with people. He's like, they were still doing deals. He's something like -- I can't remember exactly how to put it. I have to go back and read my notes or listen to the episode again. I think it's episode 295, if you haven't listened to it yet. But he talked about the fact that they would meet people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, and they would do business and do deals for the rest of their lives. Many of the people that Charlie was referring to because Charlie was 99 when I met him were dead, but he said that's exactly what they did. Okay, so let's go back to this idea where Lucas is just -- he's unmanageable. He's a juvenile delinquent. And so now he's in film school. And the film professors are like, okay, we're going to practice making films, and they give you like this sheet of instructions, and it must be filmed in black and white, must be this -- the story must look this way and must not go over this length and George Lucas is like, "I don't give a damn, about your instructions I'm going to do what I want." Lucas made his intention immediately clear with his first on-screen credit. This was no student assignment. It was a short film by George Lucas, that is in big letters. That's what he put on this movie that he's making. Lucas had chosen to set his film to music and open defiance of his professors instructions. And so the movie he made is called "Look at Life". Even 50 years later, Look at Life is an impressive debut, aggressive political and utterly confident. As soon as I made my first film, I thought, "Hey, I'm good at this. I know how to do this."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

From then on, I never questioned it, Lucas said, and right from the rib he is completely obsessed. He preferred shutting himself in his top floor bedroom sitting at the drawing board, planning out his films and sketching out ideas. I would always try to get him to go out to parties and clubs and stuff. This is his roommate. And George would usually stay upstairs in his room, drawing these things, he called them little star troopers. This is like a decade before Star Wars. So he's drawing these things he calls little star troopers. But for Lucas, that was better than partying. I'd be working all day and all night living on chocolate bars and coffee, said Lucas. It was a great life. I had enthusiasm, and I was too busy to get into drugs. Movies where his addiction, we were passionate about movies. We were always scrambling to get our next fix. Listen to how they're describing this. This is how he knew what he's been doing with their life. Described working as your next fix to get a little film in the camera and shoot something. And then here's a glimpse of something that he's going to have problems with his entire life. He wasn't really a big fan of collaborators. He wanted subordinates. Again, he is a dictator. He prefers working alone. In many cases, I almost feel like he was born at the wrong time because he even says like he's really -- it's kind of a really bad onset, didn't know how to deal with humans. He's super shy, wouldn't talk, wouldn't give instructions. And yet he said, like he really made films in the editing room. He sits by himself editing. And so I almost think like if he is born now, he's going to -- especially with all these new technologies, basically, you're going to have one person like filmmakers because they're going to use all this technology. I think that's how George would have preferred. And you see this from a very early age because he's getting all these assignments when he's in film school, and they're going to make you work on teams, and he did not like that. He was becoming increasingly cranky about the idea of working with others and preferred doing everything himself.

He could be easily irritated if he was saddled with crew members who could not keep up with him. He's also super, super competitive. So later on in the book, it says something like Francis Ford Coppola responds back because a few times, Lucas says, "I'm retired, never making movies again." He does this a few times and Coppola is like he'll be back and like, why do you think he is going to be back. It's like because George loves winning too much. And so young, George says, I was really into making it a competition who can get it done first and best. If they couldn't cut the mustard, they shouldn't have been there. And then they also have some talent, obviously, everybody else was clear that he was one of USC's most dexterous editors. Lucas worked quickly and without complaint. He cover up any defects, shortages or missing shots in the editing room. And that's not an exaggeration. It is funny. I'm not going to talk about it because this book is gigantic, and I have covered it on other like Steve Jobs and Ed Catmull episodes, but he started Pixar. He's the one that hired Ed Catmull. He's the one who sold Pixar to Steve Jobs when George Lucas was going through a divorce, which also goes into a lot of detail on the book, which I won't cover. But this idea of being able to kind of sit at a computer and make a movie, I think if he could have done that, if he was alive now, that's what he would do because a typical movie that he would make like his first movie he shot for three days. I mean, he was on set for three days, but then he edited it for 10 weeks. His favorite part about the movie making process. He hated writing, which we'll get into. He forced himself to do it. He's got some ideas on how to do that. He wasn't good on set, but he would love, that's all we want to do. He wanted to be alone in the editing room. But we're not there yet. We're still in film school. This is more juvenile delinquent behavior. Listen when he's breaking into, this is hilarious. So he says the rules are of no concern to him. I broke them all. He said, "Whenever I broke the rules, I made a good film", so there wasn't much that the faculty could do about it. George Lucas is very resourceful.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He always would find a way to get what he needed in terms of equipment and bodies to put together a crew like sometimes when you film like when you film Star Wars in London later on, they have these like really strict rules for the London like Film Union. You have to start at 8:30. There has to be a tea and I'm not even joking about this. You have to start 8:30, then you have to break for tea at 10 a.m., and then you have to break for an hour lunch at 1:00 and then you need another tea break at 4:00 and then you can't work past 6. He's like this is madness. He didn't want any kind of restrictions. So they would break into the equipment room to get not only materials that they needed, like an expensive camera, but they would also break into facilities. It says Lucas didn't want to limit his use of the equipment to the building's regular hours either. We'd shimmy up the drain spout, cross over the roof, jump into the patio and break into the editing rooms so we could work all weekend. And this idea that you use juvenile delinquent actions to actually be more productive. One of my favorite stories from history about this is Edwin Land. He's trying to do all these experiments, doesn't have the money for the equipment he needs. So him and his future wife, they actually break into, I think it was NYU, it might have been Columbia, but they break into university and then all night, they're just illegally using their scientific equipment to make experiments rather. And this idea where Lucas is like what the hell you guys don't work weekends is absurd. In the early days, way before it turns into Polaroid, Land's first company is called Land-Wheelwright, if I remember correctly. And Land had won a bunch of awards. He was like pretty well-known scientist by the time he's like 19. He is running his company, but he's getting recruited to all these other companies. Maybe they could like buy his company or convince him to come over. And I remember there's a conversation that takes place with Land and his co-founders. Co-founder is concerned because his co-founder is more like the money guy. His co-founder is concerned that he's going to leave and Land goes, they start working at 9:00, they end at 5:00 and they don't work weekends. And so his co-founder is like, "Yes, I know, are you going to go are you going to leave and go work with them" and Land's response goes, of course, not.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

How would I get anything done, you see George Lucas is like, wait a minute, you gave us this assignment to make this film. We don't have the right cameras, so I'll just break it and take that. And then I can't edit on the weekends or at night. Are you absurd? So this is a guy. Now this also causes severe health problems when he's older. When he's doing Star Wars, he's working like 20 hours a day. This call, I'm chuckling because he's just like he had these tendencies from a very early age. But he winds up getting divorced because of this. He winds up having health problems because of this. I think he burned out a few years before. He might have directed more movies and had a longer career if he worked on consistency over intensity, but he -- in terms of optimizing or consistency on intensity, he went full throttle on intensity. And so he's going to graduate film school. Again, I said like those on the margins often kind of control the center is such an important concept. You see it over and over again, because even when you graduate film school this time, there's no mainstream movie studios hiring you. And so he starts working for the U.S. government making like these propaganda films for them during Vietnam, making his own little movies on the side. He's going to wind up being able to learn. He wins like this grant to spend some time on an actual like big budget movie studio set, and that's really important because that's where he's going to meet Francis Ford Coppola. But before I get to that, I just want to point out, like this is kind of hilarious, and I feel is the exact same way that he does. And if you're listening to this, you should probably too. And at the beginning, he's working on like a movie set. And his idea was like he didn't think he wanted to be a director. I don't really think he liked people. And he wanted -- he's like, I'll be a cameraman or an editor and he gets a job working on that and he's like, these people are bossing me around, like, he goes more than anything else, I didn't like being bossed around. I didn't like being told, which shots I could do and wouldn't and which shots I couldn't. They'd annoyed him. And he says, at this point, I was really wanted to be an editor and a camera man. And then in the course of doing this, I asked, well, maybe I want to be a director and you know how he figured out why he wanted to be a director because he figured out who was the person on the movie set that no one else can tell what to do.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The answer to that is the director so he's like, okay, I guess that's what I'll do. I'll be that. So he's making a short movie at the same time, he was like two jobs. Again, he's got -- he's a workaholic the whole, his entire life, something that his wife -- causes the breakup of their marriage. So he definitely pays a price for this. But at this point, he makes this like short movie. He's eventually going to turn it to a longer movie called THX 1138, but this is a shorter version of it. And his -- I want to talk about this because he winds up winning a bunch of awards and people watching it really think it's incredible. And one person in the audience was his dad. And I think this is a very important part in their relationship. Says he could appreciate that his son had found his calling. His son had earned the respect of his peers. Now I had been against this thing of his going to the cinema school from day 1, but we guessed he had finally found his niche. As we drove home, I said to his mom, I think we put our money on the right horse. And so as a result of that little film doing well, he gets two things that happen. He gets like a grant from Colombia pictures where student filmmakers can come watch a real like film, like a big budget mainstream movie studio film take place. And the second part is he gets to shadow the director, which is going to be Francis Ford Coppola. Now this is really important because this is what I meant. It's really hard to -- it's almost like this contrast between this innate fiscal conservatism, this hatred of debt, this hatred of risk that George Lucas has with being full risk on, which he's forced to do on his second movie, American Graffiti and his third and fourth Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back, I think, is the second one. But this idea was like he will bet everything he has, if he thinks that bet is successful and it'll buy his creative freedom.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And part of this because he's on his big movie set for the first time and he was disgusted by it. He said it was the first time he had a chance to see a major motion picture being made and Lucas was not impressed. We had have been around such opulence, zillions of dollars being spent every 5 minutes on this huge unwieldly thing Lucas said. It was mindboggling because we've been making films for $300, and we saw this as an incredible waste. That was the worst of Hollywood. So there's relentless resourcefulness that he's always going to have. George Lucas's Friendship With Francis Ford Coppola Like I'm going to get into some of the numbers of his movies later. It is remarkable. And think of them again, like I said last week in the Tarantino episode, like these are miniature businesses and viewed through that, the financial performance of his miniature businesses is remarkable before we get there. So now he's on the set of this movie. And this is really important because Francis Ford Coppola is like five, six years older than all the other movie brats, and he's the one. It's like you know how people like the first time you can run, people thought humans can't run a 4-minute mile. And then one person does it. And then immediately, all these other people are doing it, same thing here, but their first interaction was hilarious. So Coppola notices like skinny young man, beard, glasses, sitting there with his arms folded, not saying a word. And so he walks up, they tell them, "Oh, that's a student observer from USC." So he walks up to Lucas and he goes, "Hey, do you see anything interesting?" And Lucas shook his head and said, "No, not yet." And this is how I met George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola said. Now him and Francis are going to want to being very good friends right from the moment that they meet. Go back to this advice that Charlie Munger gave right, develop relationships, relationships around the world. Lucas is 23 when he meets Coppola. Coppola is 28. They're going to be making movies doing deals, starting companies, breaking up, fighting for decades. But it's really important because at that time, there is no young directors. There's no 28-year-old director doing a major movie set. You have to be an independent filmmaker to do that. And so Coppola inspires not just Lucas, he inspires Steven Spielberg too. I want to read this paragraph to you.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Coppola actually succeeded in getting his hand on the door knob and flinging open the door. And suddenly, there was a crack of light. And you could see that one of us, a film student, without any connections had put one foot in front of the other and actually made the transition from being a film student to being somebody who made a feature film sponsored by one of the studios. To Steven Spielberg, Coppola was a shining star. Spielberg said, Francis was the first inspiration to a lot of young filmmakers because he broke through before many others. So not only did Coppola proved to Spielberg and Lucas that, "Hey, this is possible." But the influence that Coppola had on Lucas too is like, "Listen, you have to learn to write." At this time, and you'll see Lucas make this mistake a few times. He tries to outsource the writing. And Coppola was saying, "Hey, what separates just a director to a filmmaker is like you have to -- any director, he would tell Lucas like any great director has to know how to put together a screenplay. And so he would repeat to Lucas over and over again like no one's going to take you seriously unless you write. And that wind up being excellent advice because Lucas forced himself to write Star Wars, which is obviously his entire empire. The reason he was able to sell his company 30, 40 years into the future, to Disney for many, many billions of dollars. And it's also one that Coppola was older, slightly older, but also like really showing, "Hey, we can -- young filmmakers can have a chance like we can get in here and do this." But it's also, he's one of the most charismatic people ever lived. I did an episode on a Coppola a long time ago, I'll link it down below. And everybody, even the women in his life say this, the people that work for him say this, Spielberg and Lucas say this. In fact, listen to what -- how Lucas describes Coppola's, just charisma. He says, "Francis could sell ice to the Eskimos. He has charisma beyond logic. I can now see what kind of men the great Caesars of history were. Coppola was magnetic."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I told you about Lucas meeting Coppola, right? I have not told you about this friendship. This might even be more important. Arguably, it is more important to his career, the friendship that he has with Steven Spielberg, which is exactly why I published that episode last week. And I think, again, to Tarantino, Spielberg, to Lucas and then Disney next week, I think these were all tied together. But a young 21-year-old Steven Spielberg goes to just the screening, and they don't tell you what you're going to watch beforehand. And he sees this student film. And that student film was this THX 1138 and this is Spielberg's response. He says, "I couldn't believe it was a student film, I was awestruck." My first impression was, "I hate you. I hate that guy, man. He's so much better than I am." Afterwards, Spielberg headed backstage where he found Lucas with Coppola, Spielberg remembered the moment warmly and vividly. George was really a friendly guy. We shook hands and became friends from that moment on and so I'm going to pause there. When he says, "I hate that guy", they both have extremely mature perspectives on this. It's like people going to see a Spielberg's movie has no -- like him being successful, does not -- it's all positive-sum. It's not a zero sum. They can go see Jaws and then next year, they'll go see Star Wars. And so there's obviously some kind of inherent competitiveness, but they really thought of each other as more collaborators. And Spielberg has said multiple times that George Lucas inspired him and said at the time of his first encounter with Lucas in early 1968, Spielberg's filmmaking was still more aspiring than actual. And Spielberg talked about this, like no longer did his role models have to be these older, in many cases, deceased filmmakers. They're actually someone his own age, someone I can actually get to know, compete with and draw inspiration from. And then it was around this time that Lucas finds his inspiration and his blueprint is going to be a blueprint for both him and Coppola as well, and he's around the same age slightly older. And it's this guy named John Korty. So Lucas is invited. He sits on a panel. He goes to a conference, sits on a panel with other filmmakers who made books into movies and one of the guys sitting next time on this panel is a 31-year-old, so slightly older and he was an independent filmmaker who also lived in Northern California.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

At this time, Lucas is in L.A., he hates L.A., he hates Hollywood. He hates the studio systems. He grew up in Northern California. He wants to go back, but he's not sure how to do it. And so John is sitting on this panel, and he starts going into the details of his filmmaking and Lucas is like, "Oh, wow, this is our blueprint." And so he says John had been running his own filmmaking facility out of a barn in a small ocean town just north of San Francisco. He had privately raised $100,000 for this movie that he was premiering by hitting up friends, colleagues and even his actors for money. He shot the movie locally and then edit it on his own equipment. At the films premier, it received a lengthy standing ovation and Hollywood executives fell over themselves scrambling to distribute it and recruit Korty, but Korty was having none of it. From what I saw at Hollywood, they can keep it. He said, "I would rather work for myself." In Hollywood, you have a producer breathing down your neck. I am happier working with less money. The risk of failure is far less. We can complete a film and maybe a year getting the results we want, that's the end of John Korty describing how he does it. It was a speech that either Francis Ford Coppola, it could came out of Francis' mouth, could came out of George Lucas' mouth, but he's the one that -- they had this idea in their mind, but then they see something which is like, "Oh, that's not just an idea. This guy is actually doing it." And so Lucas asked, "Can I come visit your setup and I'm going to bring Francis Ford Coppola with me?" And so what they show up to is Korty lives in the house on the property. He also has a barn, that barn serves as this like moviemaking studio. This is exactly what -- I mean, Lucas is going to do it on a bigger scale. They're about -- Lucas and Coppola are about to found a company that tries to do this and then that company is going to fail. But Lucas does it with Skywalker Ranch where it's like there's no movie studio there, but you can add it, you can do everything else that you need to do. And what they realize is like, "Oh, this is exactly, like this is our future. This is what we're going to do."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so shortly after this, they find another blueprint. So Coppola actually flies to Denmark to visit another independent film company. It is Danish filmmaker, his name is Mogen Scott-Hansen. And keep in mind, I need to back this up because it's so important. Lucas is 24 years old. He's 24 years old when this is happening, Coppola is 29, okay? So Scott Hansen is in Denmark, he's not in San Francisco. He's in Denmark, but he's working out of this old mansion. That's on a hill side that overlooks a body of water and it's filled with state-of-the-art equipment, come on. This is Skywalker Ranch, 15, 16 years before Lucas has the money to do exactly this. And so Coppola tours Mogen Scott-Hansen's facility. Loves this and says like I'm going to do the exact same thing. And then on the way out, Morgan gives him like a gift, and it's this 19th century optical toy and you essentially like spin it and it has a series -- it produces like an illusion of movement. And it's called a zoetrope and it's actually Greek, meaning life movement. And Coppola love the word and the description so much. That's what they're going to name. Coppola decides the name, the company he's about to start with George Lucas, Zoetrope. And so he tells Lucas, like this is exactly what we need to do. We need to get a big old house, kind of a frat house, right? And in that frat house, we're going to make movies. There's only one problem. They don't have any money. So they have to go to the studios to ask for money. And at the beginning, as they're trying to do a deal or fundraise for what they're going to call American Zoetrope, is actually the full name. The Hollywood studio is like, no, you can't make movies up there. You have to do it here. But Lucas is very stubborn. He's very persistent. He's also willing to take risk, but he's like, "I love San Francisco, I don't want to live in Hollywood. And so I'm just going to keep knocking on doors until I find the money." Now they have -- something happens that -- in some ways, they have perfect timing because you have to ride a wave, go back to the episodes I just said on Poor Charlie's Almanac.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Charlie Munger's surfing model is so important, he'll analyze extreme success. And he always asks for something like they had to surf a wave, what wave are they surfing. And the studios actually figure out at this exact same time, that Coppola and Lucas, they would have never got the money if this didn't happen. This is why I'm telling you. At the exact same time, they realize, oh, like if you -- the studio's figuring out, like if we can just hire young talent, making independent films, it can actually print money because they make films for almost nothing, and some of these -- these are like power law outcomes. And so what do I mean? There is a 1969, remember, they started -- in 1968, they're like, we're going to do this. They bang on doors, Hollywood was like, screw yourself. We're not giving you any money. The next year, the film Easy Rider comes out, okay? So it is written and directed by a 32-year-old or a 33-year-old Dennis Hopper. It was not made in Hollywood. It was made on a shoestring budget. They raised $350,000. Why is that important? $350,000 is released in theaters. The film makes $60 million. Easy Rider goes on to be one of the most profitable films ever made. And so the studio executives see them and they're like, "Oh, s_*_", and this is what they said. The studio smelled money. Why invest millions bank rolling production of an enormous film on a studio backlot when you can simply distribute independently produced films. Suddenly, independent films and independent filmmakers, which is exactly what Lucas and Coppola want to be, right? Made by young directors were in demand. The studio wanted young talent. I just said that Charlie Munger talks about the surfing, surfing the wave, listen to the words that they use to describe this. Easy Rider had created a tsunami of independent enthusiasm. Coppola decided to ride the wave right into the offices of Warner Bros. Come on, that fit together so perfectly there. So goes with Warner Bros. This is Coppola who's like -- sometimes I think you might need a guy like this because it's not like we're going to make one movie.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He is like, listen, you front us a bunch of money. We're going to bring you a finished film just like Easy Rider did. We're not going to do with this once. We're going to -- we have seven films we want to make with you guys. Now here's the problem. Coppola probably shot too big. And even he you didn't shoot too big, he definitely signed a bad deal because the executives gave them money not as an investment. The scripts aren't being optioned. They gave them a loan, and they said in the contract, this is going to cause them to go bankrupt or almost go bankrupt. The minute that Warner Bros. did not like what they were doing, have lost faith in the project, whatever the case is, they could call in the loan and Coppola and Lucas would have to pay back everything. And in true Coppola fashion, he was like, oh -- he was very confident that was never going to happen. So now he's got a bunch of money. And he's saying all these crazy things like my company is going to be worth $10 million in a couple of years, and it's going to do all this stuff. But here's the weird thing. He took a bunch of money. And he just invest in things, this is like un-Lucas. And Lucas is technically his partner but he's definitely his subordinate partner in this arrangement. And so Coppola spend all this money in the reception area. He buys an antique pool table and a really expensive espresso maker and all this other stuff. And one, it reminded me when there's a great anecdote when Charlie Munger and Buffett, I think they're buying like the Buffalo Evening News. I can't remember which one, they're buying a newspaper and they're toying it. And Charlie Munger's like disgusted at the opulence, and he says, why does a newspaper need a palace to publish in. And his point was like the readers of your newspaper. They don't really care what's in the newspaper. They don't care. You're investing in things that are not important to your customer. The movie equivalent of that is all that matters is what you put up on the screen. Your antique pool table, your expensive, super luxury architectural design, doesn't do anything for your customers. Like what are you doing? We saw this again. I can now talk about this publicly, but my friend, Jimmy Soni is the author of this book called The Founders.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I think I covered it back on Episode 234, and I also covered his biography of Claude Shannon a long time ago, maybe Episode 94, something like that. And me and Jimmy become friend since I covered those books and his next book, this is a book called, I also covered a long time ago. It's called Steve Jobs & The NeXT Big Thing and it's on the 13 years, this is what I call Bizarro Steve Jobs, the 13 years between, he was kicked out of Apple and then he returns. And it's really about the founding of NeXT. And the reason I call it Bizarro Steve Jobs because he's arguably the greatest entrepreneur ever. And yet in this 10- to 13-year period, you see this incredible gifted entrepreneur just make one bad decision after another. It's what I mean. Jimmy, I can talk about this publicly now. I asked him. Jimmy's his next book, he's writing a book on this time period. And Jimmy's a fanatical researcher. He's been sending me -- his archives, it's just incredible what's going to come out. Anyway, reading that book, which is published a long time ago. The NeXT -- I think it's by Randall Stross, Steve Jobs & The NeXT Big Thing. There was a line in that book, that blew my mind that reminds me of what Francis Ford Coppola is doing here. It's like what are you doing? You're putting an emphasis on things that are not important. And what do I mean by that? Steve Jobs, one of the -- the ninth employee, if I remember correctly, 9th or 10th employee at NeXT was an interior designer for the office. That's absurd. That is not -- that is Bizarro Steve Jobs. Steve Jos made phenomenal decisions. That is a bad decision. This idea of putting a bunch of money into things that don't affect would actually -- the customer experience makes no sense, and yet you see this, it's a mistake that people make over and over and over again. Another thing they do. They buy a bunch of expensive equipment, which maybe they need, yes, okay? But then they decide, hey, it's not just for us, any filmmaker in San Francisco can come by and rent this very expensive equipment that we need to make our movies. What do you think is going to happen? Most of that equipment winds being lost or stolen. And then Coppola also has ideas like, hey, you know what we need? We need our own airport. We need a fleet of helicopters.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He doesn't have the money to buy this yet. But that's where his eye is like that has nothing to do with what you're trying to do, just make great films that people love so much that they pay money to see, and they tell their friends to go see it. That's all you have to do. And so this fight right now, like Coppola and Lucas start fighting immediately because this is a bad cofounder match because Lucas is saying, Lucas in very plain language, he's very easy to interface with because he tells you what's important to him when he's in his 20s and it's still important too when he's in his 70s, right? And so he says, what we're striving for is total freedom, where we can finance our pictures, make them our way, release them where we want them release and be completely free to express ourselves. You have to have the money in order to have the power to be free. That is why Lucas wanted to make as much money as possible. He wanted to buy his freedom. He wants a complete control and he never wanted people to decide what he should be working on or to tell him what to do. That's it. That's all you need to know about Lucas. And the reason I would recommend reading this book is because it goes into great detail of how he actually accomplished that. Now I'm going to talk a little bit about that, but I do want -- what is fascinating is that not all the ideas they were having, they're young entrepreneurs, don't have experience, don't really know what they're doing. The movies they're going to make are going to flop. But what's fascinating is like they still had an insight into the future. And so it says both Coppola and Lucas predicted a bold high-tech future. Remember, this is 1969, 1970, maybe. And they said movies will eventually be sold like soup. What does that mean? You'll be able to buy it in cartridges for $3 and play it as you would a record, music record at home. He's predicting VHS tapes, then DVDs, then Blu-ray and now streaming. And so the first movie that American Zoetrope is going to make is this movie THX 1138 really is -- Lucas is making a film about himself because the main idea, it's like science fiction kind of weird. So he kind of like hides that. But essentially, just you should reject the status quo and in your pursue of freedom.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so he's talking about the idea behind the movie in one sentence here, it stuck with me from the first time. I remember this line from reading this book for the first time seven years ago. So he says this movie is the importance of self in being able to step out of whatever you're in and move forward rather than being stuck in your little rut. This is a sentence that stuck out to me. People would give anything to quit their jobs. All they have to do is do it. Their people in cages with open doors. At its core, THX 1138 was about refusing to accept the status quo. It's about a hero who lives in an anthill and dares to go outside. This issue of leaving a safe environment and going out into the unknown would be an underlying premise of his first three films, THX, American Graffiti and Star Wars, he is really making a film about himself, reject the status quo and pursue freedom. And the problem is that THX 1138, the studio hates it. They hate it so much. This is so bad. Now, this is, I guess, is important. There's two things that are going to happen. I want to talk to you about The Godfather. And I want to talk to you about the fact that George Lucas's first movie is so terrible that it literally causes the collapse of this company and the cancellation of this deal. And yet as a direct result of this, it also leads to the next thing and his desire for control, which is Star Wars. It goes back to what Tarantino said, what Spielberg said, a lot of entrepreneurs say the same thing. You're in the middle of it. You have no idea the impact that you're potentially having. And a lot of people quit before they even get to realize that. And so because the studio is like this is freaking terrible, the deal's off, give us our $300,000 back. They're now in debt. The company's hemorrhaging cash. Coppola has no money at all. He's desperate for money. And so he gets an offer, right? He only wanted to do his own films. He gets an offer in the summer of 1970. So this happens really fast. You're talking about 1.5 years and the company is gone. And it's an offer he couldn't refuse because it comes from Paramount Pictures and they're saying, hey, we're going to make an action film based on one of the biggest books of 1969, which was written by this guy named Mario Puzo and that book is a sprawling gangster novel called The Godfather.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so he goes to Lucas. He's like, they offer me this Italian gangster movie, he does not want to do it. He's like, should I do it and Lucas, he's like -- his whole thing is like you have to stay in the black. Lucas has a mantra that he repeats over and over again, and I think it's really good. Stay small, be the best, don't lose any money. Stay small, be the best, don't lose any money. And so he's talking to Coppola like what the hell, you have no money. They're offering to pay you a bunch of money to direct a film, you have to do it. I don't think you have any choice is the advice that he gave his friend Coppola. We're in debt and you have to get a job. And so reluctantly, Coppola agrees to direct Godfather. He gets $75,000 to direct and he's going to get 6% of any profits the film makes. And so on the way out the door, the studio owns because they lend him the money, they own THX 1138. They can do whatever they want with it. They didn't like the editing job that Lucas did, so they give it to their own in-house editor and Lucas thought, listen to what he says here. So they went up cutting another four minutes from Lucas' final cut. And this induces Lucas into a state of rage. He says there's no point for them to do it other than exercise some power. Their attitude was that we can screw around with your movies and we're going to. Lucas had no patients with executives who argued that they'd only cut four minutes from a 90-minute film. "They were cutting the fingers of my baby," he said. Lucas wouldn't trust the studios again ever. And again, at the time, this sounds like the end of the world. It's the worst thing that ever happened. They cut my film, our company is over, but it wind up being one of the best things that ever happened to him because this is the founding of Lucasfilm, the exact company, he's going to sell to Disney. And he talks about like why they had to have a cofounder breakup because it really was sparked by the different management styles and their attitudes towards money. Lucas says, I'm very cautious. I don't borrow money. I'm very protective of the things that I built.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Lucas is always tight with the dollar and Coppola would continue to spend money recklessly. Lucas had made up his mind to break away from Coppola and to make it on his own, determined to control his own projects, no studio he vowed, whatever force them to compromise is vision again. This led him to forming his own company in 1971, Lucas officially opened Lucasfilm. This independent production company run out of his little house and its lone employees were him and Marcia. Marcia is his wife. So even though they broke up as cofounders, they're still friends, and Coppola actually gives him some good advice because THX is just this weird abstract. They called Lucas at the time, a cold weird director. So it's not -- he's like, what are you doing with those like strange abstract stuff. He's like stop being so weird. You need to do something human. You need to do something that makes money because if not, you're going to -- your career is over before it begins. And so the advice that Coppola gave him was like, you should just write something that has to do with your own life. An experience you know well, something that is more positive. And so Lucas has this idea to make this movie that's going to be one of the most profitable, best return on investments of movie ever made, and it's called American Graffiti. And so at the time, he grows up at this little town in California, they do this thing called cruising. So on Friday and Saturday nights, this like little town, they would soup up these cars and they would just drive slowly down one block, then turn around and do it all over again. They just cruise over and over again. And so he's like, well, since I spent my youth doing this. It's like a coming-of-age film about last year of high school transitioning in, like everybody knows that experience. It's like your entire life is going to change. You have no idea what's going to happen. So that's what he's going to make a movie on. Here's the problem. No one wanted to give him money. And this was fascinating, he didn't even think about this because he's got no money. He's considered damaged goods, and he's struggling to get any kind of money for -- to write the script. And then once he write the script then he's got to make the movie. And he talks about the predicament that he's in. He says, "Listen, the easiest job you'll ever get is trying to make your first film."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

At the same time, he's looking for a place where he can actually house all of his studios and build this vision that he's had. He was working on, when he was in this early '20s, with Francis Ford Coppola. So this is the idea for Skywalker Ranch. And he has his ideas. He's like, I want to live in a ranch house or work in a ranch house rather. I had forgotten that Lucas never lived in Skywalker Ranch, he's just where he worked out of. And so he was like, "I want a lot of property. I want it to be a house. I wanted to be in the middle of nowhere, and I want to fill it with the most advanced technology where we could sit, see the trees and make movies." So he buys the first 1,700 acres right now as he's making the sequel. And that eventually, he buys a bunch of surrounding properties and or owns 5,000 acres. And so the way to think about what he's doing, he's literally betting the Skywalker Ranch on the sequel. It's either going for a complete freedom or bankruptcies. He is putting everything he has into this. And everybody around him is saying, "Hey, don't do this, give up more points, take more money, like this is nuts." And so he says, even those who knew Lucas were a gas that his bullheaded determination to finance the entire film himself. Independence was one thing, bankruptcy was another. But those people were missing the point, Lucas wasn't paying for a movie, he was buying his own creative freedom. He realized that this is an opportunity he had to pounce on. He said the perfect opportunity to become independent of the Hollywood system. There would be no studio executives staring over my shoulder in the editing room. No executives forcing him to make arbitrary changes. That is the part that I wanted to avoid he said. "Everything I own, everything I have ever earned is wrapped up in The Empire Strikes Back", he said. If this is a flop, I will lose everything. He continues, "All the money I made from Star Wars was committed to this film plus more. But I didn't want to go to Fox and give them the movie because I'd have to give them all the rights back," meaning if he had to get money from them.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

That's the easy one to get because nobody knows whether you can make a film or not. After you've done that, then you have a heck of a difficult time getting to your second film off the ground. They look at your first film and they say, "Oh, no, no, we don't want any more of that." And so Lucas goes back to doing what he was doing. He's like knocking on doors, trying to figure somebody just give me a little bit of money, so I can write the script. Now this is hilarious. He eventually fails a few times. Then he gets to the president of United Artists, this guy's got the perfect name for his job. His name is Picker, David Picker, he's literally having to pick screenwriters and film makers, like what's going on here? And so he's like he's telling me about this. And he's like, "I want to write -- I need money, and I want to write American Graffiti." And Picker says, yes, on May 14, which is also Lucas' birthday. He had just turned 27 years old. He gives him like $10,000 to write the script. Lucas is going to make a mistake because he hates writing, he gives all that money to a screenwriter and the screenplays sucks. So he's got to do it itself anyways. But what was fascinating about this is in this meeting with David Picker, okay, is the birth of Star Wars. So he's like, "Okay, I'll take American Graffiti, let's do a deal on that. Do you have anything else?" And Lucas is like, actually, I do remember him sitting back in his room meeting chocolate bars and drinking coffee and getting diabetes, which he definitely got diabetes at a young age. He was drawing a little starship troopers. So Picker is like, hey, what else you got? And Lucas told Picker about his idea for this unnamed space opera fantasy film. Great, said Picker. We'll make a deal on this too. And that Lucas said, was really the birth of Star Wars. It was the only -- this is fascinating. Think about how he says this, right? It's a birth of Star Wars. It goes from a notion to an obligation. It was only a notion up to then. At that point, it became an obligation. Then I got to get to one of the most fascinating things what I personally find most fascinating about Lucas. Other than his desire to innovate his invention to be vertically integrated to control everything. These are things obviously personally identified with, and I think a lot of entrepreneurs do.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But there's just parts of your job doesn't like we get to -- we're unbelievably lucky to be entrepreneurs. I think of what Sam Walton said in his autobiography. So said the great thing about entrepreneurship is you got to spend your time building something you enjoy. Most people don't get to do this. They're stuck in jobs they hate. I had the time of my life. But even with that, there has to be something that Sam didn't like doing. And Lucas is a person of that just like he hates writing. And so he blows all the money. He has no money. He is poor. He's got no money. He's going to go into debt in a minute. And so he says, "My intense desire to get a writer head backfire on me, and I ended up with an unusable script and no money." And so this is what he's going to do. He calls it bleeding on the page. He says that line, I don't even know now 10 times in this book. And so he's like, "Okay, forget it, I'm going to have to do this myself." And so over the next three-week period, he writes from eight in the morning until eight at night, seven days a week. He calls it bleeding on the page. He also has humiliated because now he's got no money. Coppola has got a bunch of money because of Godfather. So he goes to Coppola and George Lucas Sr. He's got to go to his dad. His dad had told him, "Don't do this, you'll never make any money. You'll be a bum" and he's almost 30. And he's like I need money, dad. You have to -- can you loan me money, so I can do this movie? And this is the insane thing. It's so hard to comprehend and I don't even know how many people would make this decision because he somehow maintains this focus on getting his own project done through the struggle, okay? So he's got -- he's writing - the script is done. Now he needs money to make the movie. He's going around. No one wants to give him money to make the movie, but they were interested in him as a director, just not directing his own screenplay. Think about this. He's got no money. He's in debt to his dad and Francis Ford Coppola, they're offering him $100,000 to direct a film.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He thinks the film is s_*_. He hates it. He's like these are terrible projects. And he says, no, and this is interesting. Why? He's like, if Graffiti sells, I can't be in the middle of another project for someone else. So he had to turn down every offer. Listen to what he says about this. That was a very dark period for me. We were in dire financial straits. He's already married, okay? It was a very dark period for me. We were in dire financial straits. I turned the movies down at my bleakest point when I was in debt to my parents, in debt to Francis Ford Coppola, in debt to my agent. I was so far in debt, I thought I'd never get out. Lucas Betting on Himself It took years to get from my first film to my second film, banging on doors trying to get people to give me a chance, writing, struggling with no money in the bank, getting little part-time jobs, eking out a living, trying to stay alive and pushing a script that nobody wanted, a script that nobody wants, he's going to give the person that finally finances the film one of the greatest return on investments in movie history. Think about that. So there's this guy at Universals, a guy named Ned Tanen, finally gives him a shot. But Tanen produces films that are usually only budgeted. These are small-scale films, $1 million or less is usually what Tanen can do. And even though, this is incredible too. Even though, Lucas doesn't have any other options, no one else is willing to finance this. You see that his desire, remember how it started. George Lucas unapologetically invest in what he believes in most, himself. He bets on himself here. He could have been paid, he could have asked for a big director fees and say, "No, no, I want a less director fee. I will cut my director fee in half. I want $50,000. I will not only direct it, I will write it for that fee. There's no extra money for that, but I want 40% of the profits if there are any profits." And at this time, he's doing that, it is a big if that American Graffiti could ever turn a profit. George Lucas before this had never had a successful film. He just had a flop.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so through this entire book, there's huge chunks of the book that I think you should read because it's just a problem, after problem, after problem, after problem. I'm going to read just a highlight of this from American Graffiti. And then I want to tell you one of my favorite ideas I've ever come across. So despite the agreement he had negotiated with the town under which he could pay $300 a night to film on Fourth Street, local businesses, we're already complaining about closing the street. When Lucas and his crew arrived, they learned that a local council have withdrawn permission for him to film and would not permit to clear or control traffic. Lucas made the most of the evening, anyway, rapidly shooting its way through 19 setups and scrambling to find a new location. Then we had a focused problem on the camera and the assisted cameraman was ran over by a car, then we had a five-alarm fire. That was a typical night. So Tarantino in his book, he says, the job of a director is to solve problems, right? Solve problems for your actors. And I read this book by Danny Meyer, the famous restaurateur a long time ago, now you're talking about 8 years ago, probably. It's called Setting the Table. It's excellent. And he tells a story that I've never forgotten. And so he's at dinner with Stanley Marcus, who is part of the Neiman Marcus family, the family that controls the Neiman Marcus. He's a wiser older man, probably, I would guess, 40 years older than Danny at this point. I think Danny's in like mid-20s, maybe late 20s at this point. And so he's -- they're having this conversation and he says, opening this new restaurant might be the worst mistake I've ever made. Stanley set his martini down, look me in the eye and said, so you made a mistake. You need to understand something important and listen to me carefully. The road to success is paved with mistakes well handled. His words remain with me throughout the night. I repeated them over and over to myself and it led to a turning point in the way I approached my business. Stanley's a lesson reminded me of something that my grandfather had always told me. He said the definition of business is problems. His philosophy came down to a simple fact of business. Success lies not in the elimination of problems, but in the art of creative, profitable problem solving.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The best companies are those that distinguish themselves by solving problems most effectively. I tried to reduce that idea -- first of all, that line right there. The road to success is paved with mistakes well handled. That's just straight up wisdom from an older, well-schooled entrepreneur. But this idea that the definition of businesses problems, right? Success not lies not in the elimination of problems, but in the art of creating profitable problem solving. What I say is like the way I condense that down so I can remember myself, business is problems. Therefore, the best companies are just effective problem-solving machines. The best directors are just effective problem-solving machines. And so after this grueling schedule, he finally finishes the movie. And what he says here, this is what I mean, like if you could dial the balance between consistency and intensity, I think he's way too far in the intense level and maybe that's the way he wants to live his life, it's none of my business, right? But I think for a long career, you have to have more of a balance between consistency and intensity. And so he says, Lucas was glad that it was over. You couldn't pay me enough money to go through what you have to go through to make a movie he said. It's excruciating, it's horrible. You get physically sick. I get a very bad cough and cold whenever I direct, you feel terrible. There's an immense amount of pressure and emotional pain, but I do it anyway, and I really love to do it. It's like climbing a mountain. And what is fascinating is he starts to preview the movie, the audiences love it and the studio execs -- this is so nuts to me. The studio executives can be in a theater full of cheering potential fans and customers, right? And they're like this movie isn't good enough. We're not going to release it. Maybe we'll put on TV. They're just like completely jerking around and screwing them over, and he's obviously depressed. And he's like, this is where he's like, "I'm going to be an independent filmmaker, I'm going to control the money." He hates these people. And then they added his film again, and they take out another four minutes, just like they did in THX. And this is the importance of just having good relationships and good friends that truly care about you, too, because they're at the screening, Lucas is there, Coppola is there, the senior executives are there, and the crowd loves it in the -- but after in like the lobby, the executives like bitching at George Lucas and Coppola is just -- he comes to the defense, just like, "Are you out of your mind? Do you not hear them?"

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And he pulls out his checkbook. He's like, how much do you want for the movie? You don't want to put this out, sell it to me and I will invest my own money and I will release this movie, you have a hit on your hands. Coppola's forcefulness kind of calls their bluff, they wind up releasing the movie, the movie is a smash head. Listen to this, though. So it has this great review in the New York Times. They called American Graffiti a work of art. Now this was very fascinating because this is the way I thought when you read about George Lucas, the way I think of him as I think of him as a craftsman, turns out that's how he thinks of himself because he does a lot of this stuff himself. He didn't really like the fact that people called it a work of art. My thing about art is that I don't like the word art because it means pretension and bulls_*_ and I equate those 2 directly. I don't think of myself as an artist. I'm a craftsman. I don't make a work of art. I make a movie, and you can also see he's not modest by any means. I know how good I am he said, American Graffiti's successful because it came entirely from my head. It was my concept, and that's the only way I can work, and it prints money. Keep in mind, American Graffiti is released in 1973. So these are 1973 dollars I'm about to tell you. American Graffiti cost $1 million, and it earned at the box office $55 million, making it one of Cinema's most profitable returns on investment ever. Lucas earned nearly $4 million after taxes. And as he had vowed to his father more than a decade before. Lucas was a millionaire before the age of 30. He had done it with two years to spare. The Making of Star Wars And he's got to figure out what am I going to work on next. And he has at this point in his life, he's got a couple of million in the bank, and he's got a two-page treatment on hand-written notebook paper, and the title, which is scrolled in the center of the treatment's cover page is the Star Wars. Now one of the smartest things that George Lucas does is learn from his own mistakes.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he's not going to hire somebody to write the Star Wars, and he's going to bleed on the page. There's an entire chapter about this. It's called bleeding on the page because George says over and over again, like in the book, I forgot, I lost track of how many times he says this. He's like, he does not believe that he had a natural talent for writing. And so he calls the process awful, he hates it, but he makes himself do this. Listen to this. So it's going to take him three years to write like the first version of Star Wars. But the way he does this is fascinating. So he's like, okay, I'm going to treat the writing of Star Wars. It's going to be a full-time job, okay? So he's still working out of his home. He's got upstairs like an office, studio library kind of thing. And he's like, "I'm going to go upstairs at 9:00. I can only do one thing. I can look at the wall or I can write, but I can't do anything else." And from nine to five, eight hours a day, listen to how he describes this. He says, "I would sit at my desk for eight hours a day, no matter what happens, even if I didn't write anything." It's a terrible way to live, but I do it. I sit down and I do it. I can't get out of my chair until 5:00. It's like being in school, but it's the only way I can force myself to right then over his desk, he would hang this giant wall calendar to track his progress. And he's like, "Okay, I have to write five pages every day, and you mark a big X, like a big X on the days where you write five pages. And here's the deal he made with himself. If I can finish my five pages a day early, then I can leave. So some days, he gets to eat his chocolate bars and listen to music, but most days, no words are written at all, and then he would just go downstairs, and he glare in anger at the TV. He eat a TV dinner, and he would just be p***** off staring and watching the news. Another idea I think is useful, is he is having a problem, right, like think about the -- a lot of the scenes in Star Wars, it's action. He's got an idea in his head, but he's reading on the paper. It doesn't seem -- it's like not matching up.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I thought this is fascinating. He makes kind of a demo of sorts. If you read the book Creative Selection, it's Episode 281. I've read that book like four or five times, anybody building a product, I think, should read it. This programmer that worked at Apple under Steve Jobs named Ken Kocienda and sees many things like, hey, we need to make demos. Like that's how we're going to push these ideas forward. Not presentations, I want to actually see it. And so George is like trying to explain his idea himself and to others, so he's like, "I need a demo." And so this is this demo that he makes for Star Wars. And so he says, one of the key visions I had of the film when I started was of a dogfight in space with spaceships, two spaceships, flying through space shooting each other. That was my original idea. But trying to get the dogfight in my head on paper was difficult. And so what he would do is he go to the television, and he'd start taping old war movies, and specifically footage of airplanes like dogfights of airplanes. And he takes 20 hours of these like scenes from random movies, right? He then transferred it to film and then he would edit it down to a real of about eight minutes long. And the description of this reel is fascinating. He says, while he didn't yet know the real of dogfighting would be one of the most important bits of film he would ever put together. The wet concrete that he would pour into the mold for the cornerstone of his film Empire. So now he has something that he can show. Now he needs to go and raise the money for the movie. Now this is fascinating. You and I have talked about this over and over again already, Lucas desires control above all else. And he's still stuck to that idea even though FOX was the only studio who said yes to Star Wars. Think about this, arguably the most successful movie franchise in history and only one studio said yes. And so even though he's negotiating with the only interested party, one, there are certain things in this contract that he demands, right? And so he wants as much control over the final edit of his film as possible. And even says, like I'm not willing to listen to other people's ideas. I want everything to be my way. That's an exact quote from George Lucas.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so I would argue this is his most important -- what's about to take place here, this is the most important decision ever. So he starts negotiating with FOX and this is what George Lucas says about this. FOX thought I was going to come back and demand millions of dollars in all these gross points, recalled Lucas. I said, I'll do it for the deal memo, but we haven't talked about things like merchandising rights and sequel rights. He would insist that those particular clauses normally considered underbrush in a contract. It's really weird that they didn't understand at this point, how important merchandise rights were. Because if you remember, I've done a bunch of episodes on Walt Disney before and they were even surprised. They did a show called Davy Crockett. They sold like $300 million in a year of like those Davy Crockett like hats and that was two decades before what's going on here. So FOX's just give them away, they're going to make three to five -- it says 3x the amount on Toys. Lucas makes 3x the amount of Toys as it does on the films and the film still make billions and billions of dollars. It's insane. So he was like, okay, I want the merchandise, and I want the sequel rights. I'm not going to charge you more money. What was par for the course of this is if you have a smash hit, then your director fee should go from, whatever, $50,000 could go to $1 million, could go to $2 million, whatever the case is. He would also insists the Star Wars be produced by Lucasfilm, thereby ensuring that he could keep an eye on the bottom line and that any expenses built against the film were really his. I was very careful to say I don't want more money, Lucas said. I said, "I don't want anything financial, but I do want the rights to make the sequels and he wants the merchandise rights." FOX was willing to sign over the sequel and merchandising rights, mainly because they've gotten the director of American Graffiti so cheaply. And no one, not even Lucas appreciated that by securing sequel and merchandising rights, he had just negotiated for himself $1 billion clause. Decades later, FOX executives would shake their heads in wonder at Lucas' instincts and audacity. So let's go back to this idea that businesses problems and that the best companies are just effective problem-solving machines.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He's got a problem. He's got an idea in his head. No one can make the special effects. There's no technology at the time. So what did he do? The solution sometimes to a problem is to found your own company to solve that problem. The solution to this problem that he's having now is the founding of Industrial Light & Magic. So it says Lucas would not merely have to produce the visual effects. He would have to develop the technology needed to shoot them in the first place. George was absolutely adamant that he wanted to set up his own shop with his own people. Industrial Light & Magic would then be an official subsidiary of Lucasfilm, born of necessity seeded with his own money and feeding off Lucas' need to control every aspect of the production. Industrial Light & Magic would stand as one of the cornerstones of Lucasfilm's empire, an investment that would set him well on the way to becoming a multibillionaire. And then this is the quarter I shared earlier, which is one of my fair quotes in the book. How many people think of the solution of gaining quality control, improving fiscal responsibility, and stimulating technological innovation is to start their own special effects company. Ron Howard said admiringly but that's what he did. You and I have already talked about the fact that this guy is stubborn, he's persistent, he's bullheaded and you have to be. Why is that so important? People thought he's like making this like little kid's movies, this is like he's kind of getting depressed, but he's still persevering because his friends advice. It says, Lucas saw Star Wars as his response to a weary world in need of new heroes and mythologies.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

His friends said it was a juvenile exercise unworthy of his talent. They said, George, you should be making more of an artistic statement. Yes, that's a good way to go out of business. What are you talking about? He did that with THX 1138. How did that go? People were telling me that I should have made Apocalypse Now. George Lucas said, they said I should be doing movies like Taxi Driver. His own wife was telling him that because she was one of the main editors for Martin Scorsese, and she wanted her husband to make movies like Martin Scorsese did. But I think this idea, it's one of the most important ideas I've learned in the last like 1 year, 1.5 years, it's like you have to believe that your own opinion about what you're working on is greater than everybody else's opinion around you. None of this works if you can't trust your own judgment. And so another important thing. This is really the power of deadlines because he's been working on the script for three years, and he has to shoot the movie now. And the important part about having a deadline is like if that didn't happen, he'd probably still be working on the script now. I didn't really know where to go with it, and I never fully resolved it. It's very hard stumbling across the desert, picking up rocks and not knowing what I'm looking for. And knowing the rock I've got is not the rock I'm looking for. I kept simplifying it. I kept having people read it, and I kept trying to get more of a cohesive story, but I'm still not very happy with the script. I never have been. I have never arrived at a degree of satisfaction where I thought the screenplay was perfect. If I hadn't been forced to shoot the film, I would doubtless still be rewriting it now, the power of deadlines. And again, there's an entire book I might cover. So I think you already know this, but when I read all these biographies, when I'm done, I go through the bibliography and I find a bunch of new sources to read more books out in the future and turn into more episodes. And so I found one, two, three, four new books from this bibliography, and one of them is just about how gut wrenching and difficult making Star Wars was? I think maybe reading that book and doing the entire episode on it would be fascinating. But I can give you a brief synopsis here.

From day one, Star Wars would be problem plague production that would blow through its budget, mentally and physically exhaust Lucas, and try the patience of executives at Fox that there's so much out of the studio, very nearly pulled the plug on the film altogether. "I forgot how impossible making movies really is," Lucas wrote. I get so depressed, but I guess I'll get through it somehow. And another example of this idea, it's really hard to tell what you have when you're in the middle of it, he goes and visits, Star Wars is nearly killing him. This is what I mentioned earlier. He's working 20 hours a day on it. And he's so deep into it, he goes, decides to fly down to Alabama to visit his friend, Steven Spielberg, who's working on the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and he brings with him like this booklet of all these like black and white pictures from the set. And Spielberg is going through this and he thought it was amazing. But the reason I bring this up to you is because Spielberg tells us what George was thinking at that time. He says George was so depressed, he didn't like anything. He didn't like the lighting. He didn't like what the camera man was doing. He was very, very upset. He was saying, "I got myself into a mess that I'll never really get myself out of." He was in a state of near despondency so much so that he's rushed to the hospital. He feels sharp pains in his chest. He was afraid that he was having a heart attack. So he gets checked into a hospital. They diagnose him with hypertension and exhaustion. So after that he is like I'm never doing this again, but he had no intention of relinquishing control over the film even if it killed him. He's got to get this done first. And it wasn't until I read that section. I went back and looked, I thought he directed all the Star Wars movies. This is the last movie he directs for 22 years until Episode I - The Phantom Menace. So Star Wars comes out in 1977. He's a director, and then he stops doing that. He becomes an executive producer. He bankrolls it. He writes a story. He picks the directors, but he really meant it, like he hated directing. And so he finally finishes the film or it's almost done.

And this is fascinating because this happens too. I mentioned I was going to do another episode on Tarantino at the end of the Tarantino episode, but I relistened to Tarantino, and I thought it was really, really good, so much and I kind of tell because you got a lot of responses and the text messages, I was getting from like hit a note, like people really, really liked it and I was like, I'm not. And then I looked at the outline for the second Tarantino episode is making. And I may well do in the future, but I was like, man, if I can do this right, like it's going to pay on comparison to the Tarantino episode. So I shelled it for now. But in that source material, some of the research I was doing come across this conversation where Tarantino, Reservoir Dogs was a hit, but it wasn't like a smash commercial hit. And so he's nothing like what Pulp Fiction is going to be. And so Tarantino screens Pulp Fiction before it is released to a bunch of director friends. And everybody hates it, except one person, all of his director friends. One of his director friends, he tells a funny story. It was like, okay, I got to have a real serious conversation with my friend, Quentin, like he's got to change it. This isn't good enough. He's like, I'll wait until he gets back from Cannes, I think Cannes Film Festival is how you pronounced it or Can, I don't know how to say it. But he's like I'm going to wait until he gets back and then Pulp Fiction wins all the awards there. So he was like, okay, guess what, say anything. But this idea where even your really gifted friends may not understand the value of your idea, where you had, let's say, six director friends of Tarantino, five of them says this sucks. Think about it, how the hell, you guys see Pulp Fiction and think it sucks. And one was like super supportive. The same thing happens here. He goes and he screens Star Wars. And his wife, who hadn't seen the film since the first cut, she was off, I think editing for Scorsese if I remember correctly. She burst into tears. She's certain that it's a disaster. Brian De Palma is just lighting into him. He goes, what is all this forced s_*_, like the forcibly with you, screaming at him. They go to dinner, he's still rambling at it. And yet, there was one person in the room who was impressed. "I loved it because I love the story and the characters," said Spielberg. I was probably the only one who liked it, and I told George, how much I loved it.

That evening, an executive from Fox called Spielberg, we all need friends like this, called Spielberg, to ask what he thought about what he had seen. Spielberg told the executive that he thought he had a hit on his hands, one that it would eventually make $50 million or $60 million, while we're re-wrong, Spielberg said, why? It's not going to make $50 million or $60 million. The budget for the original Star Wars was $11 million. At the box office alone, it brought in $775 million. Think about funding a business, all you took to build that business was $11 million, and yet that business makes $775 million just at the box office to think about all the money it's made since then, probably 4x, 5x that amount alone just from that one movie between merchandise and rides and everything else. That reaction from a movie where all these other talented people, all the other people in the room, besides Spielberg, said this is trash, so much so that some people were crying at how bad it was. And so before I move on to his biggest bet, which is, hey, I'm going to control the funding for The Empire Strikes Back. He's going to make $100 million on this bet that he's about to make on himself. But I did think I'm a sucker for these really interesting marketing and distribution ideas. So something they did before the original Star Wars came out is they correctly identified like who is the natural audience for Star Wars, right? And there was this huge subculture of science fiction and comic book fans, even if they weren't making a bunch of science fiction and comic book movies at the time. So they're like, hey, we should target these people. Let's do a novelization and a comic book adaption series before the movie comes out. So they published like a novelization of Lucas' script. They published in November 1976. That's before there was even a trailer.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

By February 1977, so you're talking about, what is that, three months, four months later, they had already sold out of its initial print run of 125,000 copies and the movie wasn't available to see for another three months. In addition to this, they also had articles written in several of the largest sci-fi magazines. Again, several months before, there's kind of like planting the seeds several months before the movie is actually available. So it says by the spring of 1977 enthusiasm for Star Wars was like a pot rolling to a slow boil, and the lead was about to blow off. Okay, so now we get to, I would say, probably the craziest and most important time in the entire book in this entire life because it's going to set up the future success for everything that comes after. So he's like, I want to control as much. He was disgusted that Star Wars is making most money. Like I said $11 million budget, $775 million at the box office. But Fox, the studio, all they did was finance a film, and they get 60% of the profits, and he said they're getting 60%, the way Lucas looked at it is, he's like they're getting 60% for doing absolutely nothing. This is like, well, what do you mean they didn't do anything. And he would compare and contrast what he did for the rest of his share, right? He's like, I know what I'm doing for my percent. I put my heart and soul in this, my whole career's at stake. I have to actually go out and make the movie. And so when he's having these conversations with other people at Fox, even people he likes like an executive there name, Alan Ladd, he's like, "Well, what the hell you doing?" And Ladd's response was like, "Well, I provided the money." And George said to him, it was very fascinating the way his brain works. He goes, "You didn't provide the money. You go to a bank with a letter of credit and they supply the money, and then you get 50% of the movie." This is such an important dentition he makes here. George looked at it like a businessman saying, "Wait a minute, the studio has borrowed money, then they take a 35% distribution fee off the top. This is crazy. Why don't we just go borrow the money ourselves." And he said some of the bravest and our most reckless acts were not aesthetic, but financial. For the sequel, Lucas matter of fact informed the studio that he would be financing the film himself using his profits from Star Wars as collateral for a bank loan.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So the last time around the studio has got 60% of the money. This time, he's like, "Hey, I'm getting 77.5% and you can get 22.5%." And they take the deal because, of course, you want to be involved. Think about it like even if you own less of Star Wars and you are the Fox, Fox has a bunch of other movies. So there's going to be millions of people going to watch Star Wars too. And at the very beginning, there's a huge logo, the Fox logo, it's like advertising for them. And then I loved the way Spielberg, he saw this coming. He's like Spielberg wasn't at all surprised by the way Lucas was buying hardball. He says, if you're an executive and you're going into business with George Lucas, you are no longer in the 20th Century Fox business, you're in the George Lucas business, and George is going to call every shot. And then another mind-blowing fact, do you know that Spielberg made over $40 million off the original Star Wars. They had a bet. So again, they don't know what's going to be successful before it happens. So George Lucas was working on sci-fi, that's Star Wars I. Spielberg is working on sci-fi, that's Close Encounters of the Third Kind. And so they're like, "Okay, let's bet who's going to be more successful and let's just trade points." And so Spielberg gave Lucas 2.5% of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Lucas gave Spielberg 2.5% of Star Wars, and it says this 2.5% would earn Spielberg more than $40 million over the next four decades. And so this idea about using his assets as collateral to a bank loan, it's exactly what Fox was doing where they're just a bigger company. So he's going to use the money he made from Star Wars and then remember, he owns all the merchandising rights. This is nuts. Just in 1978 alone, George Lucas sells 40 million Star Wars figures. It's in a year. And so what he did he says Lucas would finance sequel one action figure at a time. He used the substantial profits from the film themselves, but also tapped into the revenues from an almost endless stream of Star Wars merchandise. The Vision For Skywalker Ranch & Star Wars Sequels

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I had to keep the picture going somehow, get people to work without pay, hope to held up whatever they ask for, didn't involve me having to go back and renegotiate with Fox. As always with Lucas, it was always a question of control. I wanted my independent so badly, he said. But at the same time, he has this loan from Bank of America, and they see his weekly expenses. And his costs are ballooning for the sequel. His weekly payroll alone was $1 million a week, and they're threatening to pull the loan and call the loan and shut down the operation, which is nuts, considering how big Star Wars went up becoming. So he comes up with an unique solution to his problem and he goes to Fox, he's like, "Listen, I don't want to need more money from you, but I will give you a couple more percentage points than you were getting earlier. I just need you to do one thing." So he says eventually he agreed to give a few points to Fox in order to have the studio guarantee a new loan from the First National Bank of Boston. But even with this agreement, Lucas film remained the main guarantor of the loan. And if this movie didn't turn a profit, highly likely that his business was going to go under. And so the good news was the bank didn't have to wait very long for the outcome, listen to this, this is an entire story in two sentences. The Empire Strikes Back opened in May of 1980 in 126 theaters and broke attendance records in 125 of them. No other studio opened a single movie against it. The movie was going to have to make $57 million just for Lucas to breakeven and to build Skywalker Ranch into the kind of complex he envisioned. The movie was going to have to do much more than breakeven. He needn't have worried. It became the third most successful movie of all time, and George Lucas would pocket more than $100 million in profits.

Lucas had literally bet the ranch, Skywalker Ranch and one, and that is where I'll leave it for the full story, highly recommend reading the book. The book is excellent that there's so much more in it. Like I said, this thing is massive. The hard cover is over 500 pages. If you want the full story, highly recommend reading the book. If you buy the book using the link that's in the show notes in your Pockets Player, you'll be supporting the Pockets at the same time. That is 345 books down 1,000 to go, and I'll talk to again soon.

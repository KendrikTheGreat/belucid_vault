"To promote --" and then this is another really smart move that we've seen other people apply to different domains in different industries. "To promote sales of their bicycle, they promoted the use of bicycles generally. They offered bicycle riding instruction." Instruction was free for people that owned Evans & Dodge bicycle, owners or people that owned them already had a bike that they purchased from them but cost others $2 for five lessons. Okay. So moving on. "Sometime in 1900, the Dodges sold their interest in bicycle manufacturing and returned to Detroit to open a general machine shop under the name Dodge Brothers. Now what I found really interesting and kind of humorous when I was reading this book that blew my mind. One thing that influenced their decision to sell was that Evans and other people, they wind up -- there was a Canadian bicycle cartel. They rolled up a -- we've seen this throughout history. Go back to my podcast I did on Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller. Every other industry at this time, they would consolidate. They'd roll up a bunch of independent companies into one giant cartel so they could control prices. Well, guess what? This was happening in Canada and there was this gigantic Canadian bicycle cartel. So it says, "The Dodge Brothers sold their interest for $70,500 and established their own machine shop. Their stint in Canada gave them much needed experience as machinists and as managers. They saw how you build a rather large company. And so selling machine -- like machine services or eventually cars, you're selling bicycles or manufacturing bicycles. And the Dodge brothers used the proceeds from the sale of their interest in CCM, that's the cartel to open their own machine shop, I just said that. "John was 36 and Horace was 32 years old." So they moved to Detroit, when they were 18, 22, something like that. So you have a good 10 or more years of gaining experience before they finally open their main business, right? And so think of the careers of John and Horace in steps. One, they have a small, relatively modestly successful bicycle manufacturing business, right?

"This is the story of two small-town machinists who became enormously successful automobile manufacturers in the early years of the auto industry. At the start of the Ford Motor Company in 1903, the Dodge Brothers supplied nearly every car part needed by the up-and-coming auto giant. After 15 years of operating a successful automotive supplier company, much to Ford's advantage, John and Horace Dodge again changed the face of the automotive market in 1914 by introducing their own car." "The Dodge Brothers automobile carried on their names even after their untimely deaths in 1920, with the company remaining in the hands of their widows until its sale in 1925 to New York bankers and then the subsequent purchase in 1928 by Walter Chrysler. The Dodge nameplate has endured, but despite their achievements and their critical role in the early success of Henry Ford, John and Horace Dodge are usually overlooked in histories of the early automotive industry." "Some historians continue to understate the importance of John and Horace Dodge to the automobile industry. This book is the first scholarly study of the Dodge brothers and their company, chronicling their lives from their childhood in Michigan, to their long years of learning the machinist trade and then examining their influence on automotive manufacturing and marketing trends in the early part of the 20th century." "Hyde," that's the author's name, "details the brothers' civic contributions to Detroit, their hiring of minorities and women, and their often-anonymous charitable contributions to local organizations. Hyde puts the Dodge brothers' lives and accomplishments in perspective by indicating their long-term influence, which has continued long after their deaths." "The most complete and accurate resource on John and Horace Dodge available, the Dodge Brothers uses sources that have never before been examined. Its scholarly approach and personal tone make this book appealing for automotive historians as well as car enthusiasts and those interested in Detroit's early development."

Okay. So that was an excerpt from the book that I'm going to talk to you about today, and I think also describes exactly why we should spend time studying it. And the book is called The Dodge Brothers: The Men, the Motor Cars, and the Legacy by Charlie Hyde. Okay, so I talked about this last week and over the next few weeks, I'm going to do a multipart series. So last week, we started with My Forty Years with Ford. And I want to focus on all the pioneers of the automobile industry that birthed out of the state of Michigan in the early 1900s. So today, we're going to talk about the Dodge Brothers moving forward. I'm going to cover people like the founders of GM, Cadillac, and Chrysler and any others I discover along the way. So for today, I'm going to start -- let's start right with their early life. I'd tell you a little bit about that, and I'm going to focus mostly on their career because this is a biography of the Dodge brothers, but I would say the majority of the book is actually a biography of the Dodge company. And there's just a lot of detail in here I think that we're going to find interesting. All right. So let's go to the book. Early on, it says, "The brothers grew up in a family that included a father and two uncles who were machinists by trade. They were two fiercely independent but inseparable red-headed brothers. Even at an early age, the brothers showed independence and initiative, a willingness to work hard, and mechanical abilities. They were the product of perfectly respectable lower middle-class family that was supported by skilled machinists." And so that's the way to think about the Dodge brothers. Yes, they were entrepreneurs. Yes, they were investors that made tens of millions of dollars off their investment in Ford Motor Company. But by trade and how they thought about themselves was machinists. They thought of themselves even when they were fabulously wealthy. They were more comfortable around regular working-class people because that's who their family was, that's who they were. So let's go into a little bit about their early life and their first jobs. What did they do before they started studying the machinist trades?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, "John and Horace worked hard as youngsters and showed a good deal of ambition and initiative. John, as a young boy, John drove a cow 3 miles twice a day and earned $0.50 a week for his effort. So he was cattle herding. As a teenager, John carried heavy sacks of bran from railroad cars to riverboats for $0.50 a day." That's the late 1800s we're talking about. I want to give you an example of what I think is their -- probably their strongest trait is that they had exceptionally gifted mechanical abilities. So here's an example of some of the early mechanical abilities that I just mentioned and also an illustration of the Dodge brothers. Like many of the people that we profile and analyze on this podcast, they're relentlessly resourceful and so we see that. It says, "The Dodge boys exhibited glimmerings of the mechanical genius even as youngsters. When John was in high school, his schoolmate, Fred Bonine was the first person in their city to own a high-wheel bicycle." So think of like the large wheel on the front and the tiny wheel on the back. "Bonine's family was wealthy, and the bicycle supposedly cost $200." So it's -- at that time in their lives, they could not spend $200 on a bicycle. So they made their own. "John and Horace fabricated their own high-wheel bicycle from scrap. They fashioned the high wheel by hand and used the wheel from a baby carriage for the small rear wheel. They proudly rode their homemade creation around town for 2 years, and it worked as well as any store-bought model." Keep that in mind because the first business they actually create before the Dodge Brothers machinery company is a bicycle company. They actually granted -- in the late 1800s granted a patent. We've seen a few other examples like the Wright brothers and some other people that we've talked about on the podcast where the bicycle industry in the late 1800s is huge. So a lot of people that wound up moving on and becoming pioneers in other fields got their start in the bicycle industry. And the Dodge brothers were an example of that as well. So I'll get there in a minute. I want to tell you a little bit more about their early career.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"John and Horace honed their skills as machinists --" so this is the first jobs they had as young men, taking after their uncle and their father. "John and Horace Dodge," rather, "honed their skills as machinists from 1886 to 1900. First, they were working for other people and then eventually opening up their own shop. And when they did work for other people, they moved up into the ranks as foremen and superintendents." So I'm going to get to the founding of Dodge Brothers in a minute, but there's a lot more to cover before them. So something I find fascinating is this idea that there's just certain cities in certain geographical locations, let's put it that way, even before cities, in certain times of history, that are just a hotbed of activity in one particular industry. So the one I always reference over and over again is the fact that Enzo Ferrari thought he was a beneficiary of the fact that he lived in Modena. He says the people in the city that he was from had a special psychosis for racing cars. And so he was able to build some of the best racing cars in the world because the talent pool that was already there. People were already -- they were a collection of misfits. They were extremely passionate, enthusiastic about what they were doing. Well, Detroit in early 1900s was full of people that wanted to build horseless carriages. So they wind up moving from a small city outside of -- in Michigan, outside Detroit to Detroit. And the note I left myself was like part of understanding the Dodge brothers' story is understanding that they arrived at the right place at the right time with the right skill set. And we're going to see how they leveraged all -- being lucky in those situations to build their automotive empire and become fabulously wealthy through multiple different ways, which is really fascinating, too. So it says, "When the family arrived in Detroit in the spring of 1887, John was 22 and Horace was 18. In 1887, Detroit was a midsized city of about 200,000 people with an industrial base that included scores of foundries and machine shops." That's what you would need, the raw materials you're going to need to make a car, right? "Over the next 14 years, the Dodge brothers became accomplished machinists, experienced managers and successful businessmen. They came of age professionally in Detroit."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Interesting enough, one of these -- so they worked at a series of different shops, machinist shops as they continued to hone their trade. And one of the places they worked manufactured replacement parts for typography machines, right? When they -- the reason I'm telling you that is because when they eventually open up their own machine shop, they will do the same thing, they'll actually manufacturer replacement parts for typography machines, and then they ask the manufacturer to replace the parts for typography machines and then they also manufacture other special purpose machinery, and they build steam engines for boats. Eventually, they discover, oh, wow. It's way more lucrative to dedicate all of our time to the automotive industry. Now I want to bring this to your attention because this is just fascinating to me. Their careers are intertwined with several of other industry -- automotive industry pioneers. So let me give you an example of just one of these, and there's a bunch in the book. And this is another example of this idea that I talked to you about that, books are the original links, they lead us from one idea to another, just like the modern links on the Internet do. And in this case, like I discovered a bunch of people that I maybe had a vague understanding of, but then they were made explicit how important these individuals were to the early development of the automobile industry. And so here's an example, one of them. It says, -- okay, well, let me give you some background first and this is important to understand. So "John suffered from severe chronic coughing," he's the older brother, "which was soon diagnosed as tuberculosis. He was unable to work for several months." During John's disability, Horace worked part-time at the machine shop of Leland, Faulconer, and Norton to help cover John's living expenses." So John's rendered sick to his bed. Horace got to work to support him, right? Now this is -- who he was -- one of the people he was working for. This becomes really important. "Horace no doubt gained valuable experience working for Henry Leland, who had brought to Detroit the high standards for accuracy already attained in machine shops of Leland's native New England."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So you see this transfer of skills and knowledge from one geographic location being routed to where it's going to be served best. It's a lot more valuable with -- those skills are a lot more valuable applied to the automotive industry in Detroit than they are in New England. Now Henry Leland is the eventual founder of Cadillac and Lincoln. What is also really interesting the more we read about the early automotive industry is how many of these companies that they founded still survived to this day. You're talking about over 120 years later. That's very, very rare. Okay, so we're going to talk about Leland and other people more in a little bit. The reason I jumped on the Dodge brothers first is because I was attracted by their wild and crazy personality. They're just wild people. Dodge brothers are heavy drinkers. They're not only extremely gifted machinists and entrepreneurs, but they drink. They get into fights. They go crazy. Also part of what makes them fascinating and interesting to study. And so we're going to see a little bit about their aggressive nature here, even before they had a reason to be aggressive. "The Dodge brothers came to the plant to see the superintendent, Mr. Piper, looking for work for both. Piper said that he wanted only one man, to which John Dodge replied, 'We're brothers and we always work together. If you haven't got room for two of us, neither of us will start. And that's that.' Piper agreed to hire the pair." And as you can imagine from this short sentence, what I'm about to tell you, you probably already caught onto, John was the more aggressive and hardworking of the two brothers. Both drink heavily on weekends but they usually drink with each other apart from others. And so that's another way to think about the Dodge brothers, and I'll talk more about that in a little bit. They did not really think of themselves as independent people. They thought of themselves as one cohesive unit.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I want to tell you a little bit more -- so John is like the loud, aggressive, like the one that's pushing, right? Horace, I'm going to compare and contrast later. He reminds me a lot of Henry Royce, the gifted engineer responsible with -- for the high-quality products that you see from Rolls-Royce, where he let other people run other areas of the business just like Royce did. Horace just focused on engineering. And we see this here because Horace is the one that invents and patents an improved bicycle bearing in 1896, and then he has his brother on there to share the patent with him. And so this is how they wind up becoming inventors and bicycle manufacturers before they opened the Dodge Brothers machine shop. Okay. "So it was an improved bicycle bearing. His innovative design had the advantage of being dirt-proof and offering a smoother ride with less effort." The note I left myself is the one I just already said to you, Horace reminds me of Henry Royce. He was a gifted engineer. He just wanted to focus on that and let other people run the other parts of the company. He was no-nonsense and he's just focused on craftsmanship. So that's how I want you to think about Horace Dodge in your mind. So they team up with another guy. This guy is named Fred Evans, and they manufacture the Evans & Dodge Bicycle from 1896 until 1900. Let me tell you a little about this guy, Fred Evans. Fred had already been manufacturing bicycles before he became business partners with the Dodges. He's got some good ideas on their bike company, one of which is to go where your competitors are not. At this time, Canada, believe it or not, was like the main center for bicycle manufacturing. "Evans & Dodge bicycle had great success in the market, in part because Fred Evans was a good salesman. His company was the only Canadian bicycle manufacturer to exhibit its wares at the New York Cycle Show in February 1897." So he takes an advantage. He goes, and he's the only Canadian company there. He spent 10 days. This is why I bring this up. He spent 10 days at the show and reportedly sold 50 wheels to dealers in Philadelphia and additional ones in New York City. So they're selling the Evans & Dodge bicycle that they made to people to resell all throughout the northeast United States at the time.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Then they have a very successful machine shop and then later, right before they die, a hugely successful automotive car manufacturing. That's where they make their own car, okay? So we're going to go over that. Let me tell you why do I spend so much time talking about the early days of companies. I find it fascinating because they're -- Dodge is now a gigantic company, sells hundreds of thousands, millions of cars right now but you had to grow into that. It's very fascinating, he go back and you see how before they were the Dodge brothers, as we know them now, they were just in their 30s trying to figure things out. So this is how they describe themselves. The very first ad -- what I'm going to read to you right now is the very first ad of the Dodge Brothers company. And they said they're builders of simple, compound, triple and quadruple expansion marine and stationary engines. "We also build and repair any kind of machinery. We do all kinds of difficult punch, die and tool work." "We do internal, external and surface grinding, milling, gear cutting and punch press work. In short, we are prepared to do any class of work that can be done in a first-class modern shop." So I clearly see -- we see from that little text ad, how they thought about themselves. And also interesting at the very beginning, hey, I need to take any job I can, I need to keep the lights on here. I got to take any job. You'll see over time they narrow their focus. So eventually, they're only producing for Ford before they jump ship and do their own car. Okay. They're also very successful at getting press. If you remember, I think it was on Founders #25, James Dyson would tell you that editorials are more valuable than advertisements. And that's how what he would use to sell a large percentage of his vacuum cleaners instead of spending money in ads. So Dodge brothers are using the newspapers in Detroit at the time to publicize the fact that they're selling services and people that own -- that want to build cars, read this and then they go to the Dodge Brothers. So it works.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The Detroit Free Press ran a lengthy featured article on Dodge machine shop in September 1901 and praised the operation enthusiastically. "It may be truthfully stated that the plant of this firm is one of the most thoroughly equipped and up to date in the city. The newest ideas in everything that can in any way assist them in their work have been adopted." So one of the people that find out about the Dodge Brothers is another person that's extremely important in the early automotive industry, and that's Ransom Olds. He's the founder of Oldsmobile. It says, "By early 1901, the Dodges had their first automotive contract. They were to manufacture engines for Olds Motor Works." That was the name of company at the time. Now I want to tell you more about Ransom Olds because he is an important character in the story of the founding of the automotive industry in Michigan. He may be the single most important person at the very beginning. It says, "Ransom Olds was, in many respects, the founder of the Michigan automobile industry and the most important early automotive pioneer in the United States." He -- because he came first, right? "He became experienced inventing with steam-powered carriages around 1887 and produced several prototypes. He decided to focus on gasoline engines after visiting the Chicago World Fair in 1893." Remember, 10 years after this guy's building his gasoline engine is when Henry Ford decides to build his. "Ransom Olds introduced the first gasoline powered carriage in June 1896, and he began manufacturing them for sale in his Lansing, Michigan factory. This was the first American automobile to sell in significant numbers." Now here's why I bring him up to you because Ransom Olds influenced many future car company founders before they were car company founders. And we've seen this in other domains as we continue to study the history of entrepreneurship. Founders are constantly influenced and borrow ideas from other founders.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So you can tie -- let me give examples of some of the most well-known founders today. You can tie the career of Steve Jobs directly to other founders like Edwin Land of Polaroid, Bob Noyce of Intel and David Packard and Bill Hewlett of HP. You can also tie the career of Jeff Bezos directly to Sam Walton of Walmart, James Sinegal of Costco and Sol Price of Price Club. That is why it's so important to study the history of entrepreneurship. All right, back to the book. "More important, the Olds Motor Works attracted the future automotive pioneers with substantial contracts for automobile components and it was the training ground for other automotive leaders." So I just list off all these people. "The Olds Motor Works provided the first automotive contracts for the Wilson Body Company." These are all people that have eventually built their own cars. Now remember, last week, I told you we went from like 2,000 automobile manufacturers down to three in the United States over, let's say, a 70-year period, something like that. So a lot of these people you may never heard of. But at one time, they had their own companies. So the Wilson Body Company, the Hyatt Roller Bearing Company, Dodge Brothers, the Leland and Faulconer Manufacturing Company, well, I just told you, eventually became the founder of Cadillac and Lincoln. "During the brief time the Olds Motor Works was in Detroit, it employed future automotive entrepreneurs such as Jonathan Maxwell, who started the Maxwell Motor Car Company and Roy D. Chaplin, who started the Chalmers Motor Company and then the Hudson Motor Company." Okay. Let's go back to the Dodge brothers because these guys are really, really fascinating. I want to tell you a little bit of how they worked, so we can have an idea of what was important to them, what made them successful and a little bit about what their personalities were like. So again, now we're using as a reference an early article written in the newspaper in Detroit in the 1800s. It says "The author the article was particularly impressed with the orderly efficient way in which the shop is laid out and managed. Perfect order prevails, no unpleasant odors --" let me give you an example. They're extremely precise people. As you can imagine, as a machinist, over multiple decades, you have to be, right? "Perfect order prevails, no unpleasant odors or burnt oil are perceptible, no pounding of loose-jointed machinery jars upon the nerves, and the numerous employees have an orderly and neat appearance that is decidedly refreshing. The result was high-quality precision work that came as a result of using machine tools with skill and care." So what really -- what can you take from that? The Dodge brothers would tell you that whatever you do, you just do it better than anyone else. That should be your goal. That was their goal.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"The Dodge Brothers were the first to establish in Detroit, a machine shop--" this is -- I'm quoting from the article now. "Were the first to establish in Detroit, a machine shop of the type where really close and accurate work could be done. They installed machine tools of a size and character that nobody else in Detroit had the courage to consider." That's another thing. They were huge risk takers. When you -- when we get to numbers, they became rich, right, off of Henry Ford but the amount of investment they had to make before Henry Ford paid them $1 was considerable. And without taking that huge risk, they wouldn't have been rich. So I'll get there in a minute. More on how they worked and managed. The brothers, of course, would prioritize hard work and then they were hand-on managers -- hands-on managers, rather. "They were always present at the start and end of the workday. When John Dodge was not working as a machinist along with Horace, he was scouring the city for more orders. The two brothers routinely locked up at the end of the day, went out for a sandwich and then returned to work until midnight before finally going home." This is the first 2 years of their machine shop. There's very -- there are very shaky ground. As you can imagine, they had to work these hours. "They would spend time planning the next day's work, preparing blueprints, making estimates, preparing the accounts and sending out letters to customers or suppliers. John Dodge estimated during the first 2 years of the company, they spent a total of only 6 weekday evenings at home." Okay. So I want to go over some crucial decisions in the early days of the company. There's going to be two I want to bring to your attention real quick. It says, "Once the Dodge brothers began making automobile components for Ransom Olds and Henry Ford, they specialized almost exclusively in automotive work. But until that happened, they took almost any work that was offered to them." Now at the beginning of their automotive work, they made two big decisions. The first, they find their plant, and plant is generous term for it, was inadequate for their needs, and they had to build a larger factory, which means they had to risk a lot of money.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But they built because they had to build a factory before the orders come in, okay? So that's the first smart thing they did. The second thing is, "The Dodge Brothers made a second major decision, more risky than the first, but ultimately a brilliant one. They agreed in February 1903 to become the major supplier of components for Henry Ford, before the current Ford Motor Company even existed." Remember, Henry Ford had two failed motor companies before he finally was successful on his third one. And the third one -- the beginning of the third one was extremely shaky, and the Fords play a huge role in that. "As a supplier to and a major stockholder in Ford," and I'll get to how they became a major stockholder in a minute, "the Dodge brothers quickly earned profits and dividends much greater than expected." Now I want to pause here. This is a lesson, one smart move to do that we see that happens throughout history is everybody is in a gold rush, you don't dig for gold. You sell pickaxes. That's the smarter route, right? Everybody in Detroit at this time wanted to build an automobile. So what did the Dodge brothers do? They don't build the automobile yet. They sell pickaxes. This sentence gives you an illustration of that. "The Dodges became suppliers for the Detroit automobile industry." They are selling the raw materials for what the automobile manufacturers need to make their cars. Just really smart, gives them a huge advantage. All right. Now -- and then another lesson I got from this book is sometimes you're granted an opportunity from random tragic events. They're outside of your control, but you can still benefit from them. One of this is following the disastrous fire that destroyed most of his factory, Ransom Olds was forced to rely on -- rely more on outside sources. So he can no longer produce a lot of the materials of any of his cars and the result of the fire was that there was more work for the Dodges.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So now let me tell you, this is hilarious, the size of their larger “factory.” And to me, this is just a reminder that it should be super motivating for us all. A reminder that all new ideas start small. So here is the description of the Dodge brothers' larger factory. "The City of Detroit issued a building permit for a two-story brick building. It was 50 feet wide and 138 feet long." Okay. So now let's get into the Dodge Brothers and Ford. I'm going to try not to duplicate a lot of what I covered in past Henry Ford podcasts, okay? But this book has way more detail because there's a series of notebooks and other things that were preserved and it has a lot more detail on like the actual early financials between the two companies, between Dodge Brothers and Henry Ford, both before they became the Dodge Brothers and before they became Henry Ford, right? "Ford Motor Company would make payments of $5,000 to them on March 15, on April 15 and then with the first delivery of their first 60 machines." So they're making -- I think the estimate is somewhere between 60% to 75% of every single component of the Ford Motor car, okay? So it says, "If Ford failed to make the required payments, the Dodge Brothers could sell all unsold machines and keep the proceeds. This provision would have at least left Dodge Brothers some assets to sell." They needed to do that because they put out like -- I think I'll find the numbers in my notes. I'll go over them here in a minute. I think it was like $60,000 before they got $1 from Ford. A lot of money, right? All right. So this provision -- okay, I already just said that. "The Ford Motor Company struggled --" here's -- I put this in bold. This is so important. "The Ford Motor Company struggled to make all of its early payments to the Dodges." It's important for two reasons. One, because we're talking about $5,000. The Ford Motor Company winds up becoming a $1 billion corporation. Henry Ford prints money. Not at the beginning. He can't even come up with $5,000. Now the second reason is important because he had a hard time paying the bills, Dodge takes stock. They take -- they own 10% of the Ford Motor Company, which makes that eventual decision, makes them tens of millions of dollars. "The Dodge Brothers delivered the first machines to Ford's buildings --" this was hilarious, check this out.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"The Dodge Brothers delivered the first machines to Ford's buildings, conveying them on horse-drawn hay racks." The note I left myself was one technology destined to displace another. Really crucial time in history. It's fascinating. So this is very surprising. The Dodges almost bankrupted Ford for lack of payment. If this would have happened, Ford’s companies basically killed in the cradle, right? "To begin production for Ford, the Dodge Brothers spent more than $60,000 for retooling and raw materials before receiving any revenues." Huge risk, right? "They had trouble getting paid from Ford right from the beginning. The Dodge Brothers met with Alexander Malcomson," he was somebody working with Ford, "in mid-March 1903 and demanded immediate payment of the first $5,000 due to them. They made it clear that they expected to receive the next payment of $5,000 that was due on April 15. Malcomson admitted to the Dodge Brothers that he did not have the money to pay them. They, in turn, threatened to take ownership of the machines and sell them, as their contract permitted." "Malcomson returned that afternoon to the Dodge plant with Henry Ford and another potential investor." We don't need to worry about his name. "They were trying to woo. On the heels of the visit to the Dodge Brothers machine shop, this investor invested $10,500 in return for 105 shares in the company. This last-minute infusion of capital kept the Ford Motor Company afloat and kept the Dodges in the fold." If this didn't happen both of the Dodge -- the futures the Dodge Brothers and Henry Ford would have played out vastly different. That's fascinating. A reminder to us that the early days of companies are tenuous. Okay. Now here's a smart move by the Dodge Brothers that I just referenced earlier because this stock is later going to turn into tens of millions of dollars. "With the Ford Motor Company habitually behind its payments, the Dodge agreed in June 1903 to write-off overdue payments of $7,000 and extend Ford an additional $3,000 credit." So what are the -- essentially giving them $10,000 for 10% of the company and in return, receive 10% of the Ford Motor Company's stock. It's a hell of a return on investment.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. Later, we know from covering past Ford podcast, Dodge Brothers are forced to sue Henry Ford because Henry Ford is not paying out the dividends and he's using it to expand his plant, okay? So I want to fast forward in the timeline before I reverse in the timeline. But Dodge is going to recount details of this 1903 contract and testimony that he gives in 1916 lawsuit to try to force Henry Ford to distribute the profits to them, to the stockholders, right? So it says, -- this is very interesting. "He estimated that the Dodge brothers invested between $60,000 and $75,000 in machinery and materials to start production for Ford. John Dodge admitted, 'We had a rather foolish contract, or we would have compelled them, meaning the Ford Motor Company, to pay over much more. We were not as wise then as we, perhaps, should have been." Or put another way, we all grow into it. We don't have -- we don't know what we don't know, how we're forced to grow into that. John Dodge had to grow into who they became, or he became. Horace Dodge had to grow into who he was going to become. Henry Ford had to grow. And everybody has to grow into who they are. And it's another way John is saying, hey, we didn't know what we didn't know, but it winded up working for us. Okay. So I want to give you some examples -- another example, there's a lot of example of the violence of the Dodge Brothers. They're just wild people. "In another incident, Ford's tester, this guy named Rockelman, went to the Dodge plant to complain about them shipping engines with loose flywheels. When he threatened to stop accepting the machines, they were shipping, the Dodge brothers nearly started a fistfight with Rockelman." That's wild times. But we also see other aspects of the personality where if they realize that they're wrong, they'll change course. So it says, "According to Rockelman, once he provides that the hole drilled in the flywheel was too big for the crankshaft that it was supposed to accept, they were gentlemen enough to apologize and said they would correct that." At this point, when they're manufacturing a lot of parts for Ford, I want to give you an update on to what a typical work week at the Dodge Brothers plant would consist of. 10-hour days Monday through Friday and 5-hour day on Saturday. So 55 hours a week.

Now eventually, Ford -- listen, there's no dullards. There's no idiots here in the early days of the automotive industry. Ford was very shrewd and smart, so was the Dodge brothers. So eventually, Ford realizes, hey, I want to become less dependent on the Dodge Brothers. That's good for him, but it also eventually becomes good for the Dodge Brothers because this will push them to make their own car. So it says, "The Dodge Brothers made the entire Ford car except the body, wheels and tires." And now we see slowly over a series of years, I'm going to read these years to you, and you'll see Ford adjusting this. It's smart move for him, smart move for the Dodge brothers. "In 1904, Ford assembled a Model B with more parts built by suppliers other than the Dodge Brothers. Henry Ford was keeping his options open and applying leverage to the Dodge Brothers at the same time." Smart strategic decision. Should -- yes, he should have done that. "1905, Ford announced his intention of producing a large share of the needed engines and transmissions in-house. 1906, the Ford Motor Company for the first time, manufactured a substantial part of its component requirements." So it's still about 10 years before Dodge Brothers start their own car company, but we see a little by little, they're moving -- they're going to have to be forced to move in that direction. Now something to understand about the Dodge Brothers, they got very, very, very rich off Henry Ford. "Dodge Brothers earned substantial profits from the Ford contracts and more important --" so they're making money as subcontractor for Ford and also receiving substantial dividends from their Ford stock. I want to go over the dividends because it also shows how fast a company can grow. These are the combined dividends from Ford: 1904, $98,000; 1905, $200,000; 1906, nothing; 1907, $10,000; 1908, $500,000, huge jump; 1909, $3.6 million; 1910, $2.3 million. So within 6 years, they go from $98,000 to $1 million -- from $98,000 a year to millions a year.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"John and Horace together collected 1/10 of the total and were no longer the struggling businessmen they had been in the first years of running their machine shop." Yes, they will soon be even richer. "By 1910, John and Horace Dodge were wealthy men. They had accumulated the trappings of wealth, especially the large homes they both enjoyed." So this is what I was referencing earlier when I said they achieved their success in a stepwise fashion. It says, "They had merely plateaued in their climb to much greater success and fortune." "An enormous new manufacturing plant was to serve as the jumping-off point for the next stage of their illustrious careers." I mean that's the plan, they're not only going to use the plant first to make more parts for Henry Ford, but also to make their own cars. All right. This gives you an idea of the size of the Dodge Brothers' operation. While Dodge Brothers were still manufacturing parts exclusively for Ford, the Hamtramck," I mean, that's probably not how you pronounce it, "plant became a large operation by any definition." "The annual part production was impressive. They could make 0.25 million transmissions, 225,000 rear axles, almost 200,000 front axles, 200,000 crank shafts, almost 900,000 connecting rods and 0.5 million universal joint knuckles. They had also been able to manufacture two dozen other parts in numbers exceeding 200,000 units." So giant operation. "The Dodge Brothers manufacture 60% of the total value of the Ford cars produced between 1903 and 1914, including the legendary Model T." So there is no Henry Ford without the Dodge Brothers and there's no Dodge Brothers without Henry Ford. To give you an idea, as you can imagine, they moved rapidly. So this is Horace Dodge, complaining about how subcontractors work slowly. "I must say that I'm thoroughly disgusted with them. They seem to think it makes no difference with them whether they finish the work this year or next as long as they get it done." Dodge Brothers were a lot of things. Dumb was not one of them. So we see this. It says, "They worried about their near-total dependence on Ford, recognizing that he would eventually manufacture all of his own components." Just like it was a smart strategy for Ford to take over control, smart strategy for the Dodge to take their fate in their own hands.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Now we got to the part where they're going to start building their own car. There's a lot of different theories out there why they made that decision or how they made the decision rather. This is the one I'm most familiar with. It says, "For John and Horace Dodge, the decision to break with Ford to manufacture their own car was not simple." Okay. That's a lot to think about in that simple sentence. Think about it. It could not have been easy since how much money they made, so much money from Ford. This decision is -- might be the most impressive thing they ever did, okay? "The Dodge brothers' decision to build their own car seem like a logical step for them to take after making parts for Ford for 11 years." "They believed they could greatly improve Ford's car without driving up its price. But Henry Ford had rigid refusal to consider improvements to the Model T and that further discouraged the Dodge brothers to strike -- or encourage the Dodge brothers to strike on their own." Now, "Theodore MacManus, whose advertising firm had Dodge Brothers starting as a client in 1914, provides a more personal version of their decision to break with Ford." "MacManus recalled a meeting between the Dodge brothers and their lawyer, this guy named Howard Bloomer. Bloomer asked them point blank, 'Why don't you build your own car?' John Dodge explained that they enjoyed lucrative contracts," meaning they're making a ton of money, "with Ford and hefty stock dividends and besides, they didn't want the aggravation of having to sell cars. Bloomer reminded the Dodges that their total dependence on Ford could prove costly to their business." It was a point of failure. "The following day, they resumed the discussion and both John and Horace conceded that Bloomer was right." This also shows that they are willing like they're smart driven individuals. They have full belief in themselves, but they're also receptive to good ideas from other people. That's just intelligent way to live. So they finally break from Ford. "The original investment of $10,000 in the Ford Motor Company in 1903 yielded a total return of $32 million." Wow. "After the legal battles ended, Henry Ford and the Dodge Brothers had a remarkably cordial relationship, an appropriate finish for a business partnership unlike any other in the American automobile industry." This is another example of how fast they moved.

"Over a remarkable 18-month span, John and Horace Dodge designed and produced an entirely new automobile, introducing a proud new nameplate that has survived to this day. While continuing to fulfill their contract to supply parts and components to Ford under -- until June 1914, the Dodges simultaneously reworked and greatly enlarged their existing manufacturing facilities to produce their new car. They also created a national sales organization and a network of franchise dealers to sell their automobile, all from scratch." There's some notebooks that survived from this time that details the excessive amount of work involved. So let me read what we found out from those notebooks. "We can see the size and complexity of the work from the surviving set of notebooks, containing materials relating to the purchase of raw materials and components for the Dodge Brothers car, along with information on the design of components and the purchase of machinery to manufacture the parts. It contains detailed cost and quality estimates for components ranging from frames, wheels, tires, bearings, piston rings and ignition systems and from more than 100 potential suppliers." "In short," this is the main point what they're telling us, "these notebooks are a primer on launching a new automobile." Fascinating. This is the answer to the question, how did the Dodge Brothers build a factory to build their own car so quickly? All while servicing the needs of a gigantic and growing Ford Motor Company. It's really impressive if you think about it. "He had asked the works manager, Frederick Haynes, how Dodge brothers were able to get such an enormous plant built and into operations so quickly." The manager of the plant explained, "Chiefly because the Dodge brothers themselves own the plant. If we had been obliged to get permission from a board of directors, from banking interest, from outside stockholders, for the expenditures of millions that we have put into these new buildings, the new machinery and new processes, it couldn't have been done. Things go smoothly when the actual owners are right in the factory and are most enthusiastic of all in having the best." That's hugely important.

You had -- they -- not only do they control the whole company, they control the money. There is no -- they don't have to go and get outside approval. It's like -- where was this? I'm trying to think what book I was reading. I did -- I covered it on the podcast where -- oh, it was -- I'm pretty sure it was Jeff Bezos when they were -- he hired -- I don't have in front of me. So let's just go off my memory and hope I’m remembering correct, okay? He hired a bunch of people from Walmart to expand the initial like Amazon warehouses. And so this guy realizes, hey, we need a lot bigger -- for the demand that we have to fulfill, we need a lot bigger warehouse network in one of the cases. So he's talking to Jeff about this one day and that's a considerable investment and relatively short conversation, the guy said something like, okay, well, I need approval to get this done. Jeff goes, you just did. Go do it and that was it. And I think it was like 300,000 square feet or something like that. It was something gigantic like that. But again, just one person is in charge, one person has all the authority they need, they can go superfast. Now I want to tell you more about the advantage that Dodge Brothers enjoyed from this simplified ownership and cost structure. And I want to compare the Dodge Brothers organizational structure right now with that of Ford and GM because I think this is really fascinating. It can be applied to your own work, and it works in other industries, right? It says, "Placing the lives and careers of the Dodge brothers in perspective can be accomplished by comparing them with contemporary auto industry pioneers," meaning people that were also doing the same thing at the same time. "Their management style in running Dodge Brothers was quite distinct from that of contemporary auto industry giants such as Henry Ford, Billy Durant and Alfred P. Sloan." So he's talking about -- primarily they're comparing and contrasting Dodge with Ford and GM, okay? "Their management style reflected their equal partnership in this venture and the relatively simple nature of the enterprise. Unlike Ford, Durant and Sloan, the Dodges enjoyed full ownership of Dodge Brothers from the beginning. Never borrowed from banks and never had to consider stockholders or a board of directors in making business decisions. Managing the Dodge Brothers operation was in many respects simpler than at the competitive firms. Production involved only one factory after 1910."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"In contrast, Ford Motor Company operations included two major manufacturing facilities and 14 assembly plants. The constantly evolving General Motors Corporation included hundreds of manufacturing and assembly plants spread all over North America." Now when I read this, remember what Steve Jobs taught us. The further you get away from one, the more complexity you're inviting in. The Dodge Brothers, they understood that intuitively. "By dividing up the tasks and responsibilities for those tasks, John and Horace Dodge stayed out of each other's way, and thus avoided duplication of efforts and conflict. Neither of the Dodge brothers were autocratic in the fashion of Henry Ford. The contrast between the management styles of the Dodge Brothers and that of Billy Durant cannot be greater." "Durant was mainly a financial tycoon, a free willing manipulator of stock and companies who combine scores of automobile, truck and component manufacturers in 1908 to form General Motors." I'm going to read his biography soon. "He was a deal maker who seemed indifferent to the profitability or efficiency of his creations. He had no interest in the day-to-day management of General Motors. His field of dreams was not found on the floor of the assembly plant like the Dodge brothers, but on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange." Okay. This is hilarious. This is Dodge Brothers doing advertising also tells you a lot about how they managed their business. So they met this advertising executive because they need to do advertising for their new car. "When MacManus arrived, John Dodge immediately revealed his attitude towards advertising. 'Horace and I go into the factory and sweat blood to save $0.001 and you fellows turn right around and throw away 10%.' MacManus, impressed with John Dodge’s honesty, began thinking about promoting the new car as honest and practical, much like the brothers themselves." It's a reminder that it's never too late to do something new. "At the introduction of the first Dodge Brothers car, John Dodge was 50 and Horace was 46." Also important to know that there's many different strategies that can work. An example of this is Dodge Brothers took an entirely different strategy than Henry Ford on pricing. "Unlike Henry Ford's practice for almost continuously lowering prices on the Model T Ford. Dodge Brothers prices rose over time, reflecting the various improvements incorporated into new models."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"When asked about the difference in price, John Dodge said, 'Just think of all those Ford owners who will one day want an automobile.'" That's a bit of a trash-talking Dodge brothers' style. Oh, let me give you more of their style. More of like John Dodge, he's definitely the one that also talks about the most because Horace is just kind of -- he's a creative genius, just trapped in his lab innovating. And John is out there kind of pushing the pace with his gigantic personality. So like most other manufacturers, at this time, they have to make supplies for the war. The government compels them to, right? This is World War I we're talking about. And from this story that happens, we're going to know a lot about his personality. "In the fall 1917, the U.S. Secretary of War, Newton Baker searched for an American manufacturer to produce delicate recoil mechanisms for two French heavy artillery pieces." No one had ever manufactured these delicate recoil mechanisms outside of France. John Dodge met, in Washington, D.C., with the Secretary of War, Baker and a delegation of French manufacturers who offered to send their skilled machinists --" now think about this. Remember, at the beginning, I told you, they primarily thought about themselves as skilled machinists. "This delegation of French manufacturers who offer to send their skilled machinists to Detroit to teach the Dodges how to make the device." "John Dodge replied in angry and earthy language that he in Horace needed only blueprints to begin machine production. Secretary Baker responded, 'Look here, Mr. Dodge, I'm not accustomed to being spoken to in that kind of language.' John Dodge replied, 'The war would be a hell of a lot better if you were.'" This guy is wild. I love him. At the time -- and then I'm going to skip over this part, but let me just summarize this part -- this section for you. "The French were able to --" they said, okay, we're going to send our skill machinists, we're going to teach you how to do this, right? They never made more than five of these things a day. The Dodge Brothers at their peak, were able to make 5x of that, 24 a day. So skilled machinists, they definitely were. Dodge brothers were bad -- you know what. Okay, let's talk about how and why they worked well together. Because maybe we could take some of their ideas and lessons and apply to our own lives, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Throughout their careers as independent businessmen, the Dodge brothers made all their important decisions together. They did have a basic division of labor in their work and maintained separate offices at opposite ends of the factory. John negotiated contracts, managed the firm's finances, directed sales, advertising and public relations, and he served as a general administrator of the company. Horace was the mechanical genius who designed the product Dodge Brothers manufactured and many machines used in their operations." "He organized and managed production. The shop floor was Horace’s domain." This is why I tell you he reminds me of Henry Royce. "He was responsible for the engineering and designing of the Dodge Brothers automobile and for the design of scores of other machines needed. In describing Horace’s mechanical inclinations, one biographer noted, his office was literally a museum of parts, past and present and prospective for Dodge Brothers cars. He was constantly scheming improved details, new processes, new methods and always building new machinery." I love this guy. "He never lost touch of the craftsman." Let's go. That's fantastic. "He never lost touch of the craftsmanship and could never let machinery alone. The atmosphere of the shop, as he entered it, would cause a noticeable change in his bearing. Outside, he was quiet, reticent and could even be termed shy. But within the four walls, he was the master of the domain. Within the four walls of the shop he was the unquestionable master of the business." A little bit more about their personality. "Long after they became extremely wealthy, John and Horace Dodge felt more comfortable among ordinary shop floor workers in the factory than with Detroit's business and social elites. John's instruction that the pallbearers at his funeral would all be ordinary shop men, is but one indication of this."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. Now I used the word pallbearers. One of the craziest things about their lives and a reminder to all of us that we just -- we don't know when our time is coming. They died early. And the time recording this, it's kind of spooky because we're going through a pandemic. They died of Spanish flu. So this is shocking. "The story of John and Horace ended tragically in 1920 with their deaths. In January 1920, John and Horace had contracted influenza, which quickly developed into pneumonia. By this time, influenza was beginning to reach epidemic proportions in the United States." So this is a Spanish flu that killed an estimated 50 million to 100 million people from 1918 to 1920. Because of -- I'm not going to go into detail because I'm sure you have enough -- you have data enough of this. This is just a history and business podcast. So you obviously don't come here for current events. I just read this book though, if you're interested in using history as an indication of what we can expect now. It's called the Pale Rider. It is a biography of the Spanish flu. Highly recommend reading that book. I listened to the audiobook a few weeks ago. So anyway, in that book, you learn that Spanish flu killed an estimated 50 million to 100 million people between 1918 and 1920. John Dodge being one of them. Horace gets it, too. He dies a few months later, but also, he had complications in the liver and some other stuff that probably contributed to his death. So it says, "Horace slowly recovered, but John's pneumonia worsened. Having lungs previously ravaged by tuberculosis only made this struggle more difficult. He died on January 14 at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York City, with Horace at his side. He was 55 years old." This -- I got to the part of this book and I was gutted. "The Detroit Free Press observed at the time of his death: 'The community can ill afford to lose John Dodge. He was a citizen who counted.'" He's one of the big forces in making of modern Detroit and there's every reason to believe that if he had lived the next 10- to 15-year period would have been the time of his greatest accomplishment." Undoubtedly, that's probably true because they're 6 years into building their own car.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Horace did not --" now this is -- "Horace did not survive the year. Chronically ill with influenza and psychologically devastated by John's death, he saw no reason to live." This is heavy. "He offered additional insight into his state of mind: 'The passing of my dear brother, John, is to me, personally, a loss --'" this is giving me a hard time reading the sentence. Okay. "The passing of my dear brother, John, is to me, personally, a loss so great that I hesitate to look forward to the years ahead without his companionship." "Our lives having been, as you know, practically inseparable since our childhood." He died on December 10, 1920, at age 52, didn't even -- 10 months later, 11 months later, he died. When you really think about their story, the note I left myself, this is a bond so tight, it can only be separated by death. "The brothers insisted that mail directed to the business be addressed 'To Dodge Brothers' or they would return it unopened. They would not accept letters sent to either of them as individuals." This practice reflected the fact that they saw themselves as one. It is a great story that illustrates how wild they were, but also how much they loved each other. "According to one legendary story, the two were drinking at the bar and began to argue about where they would take their jointly owned, $300,000 yacht for a cruise on the upcoming weekend. John wanted to go north from Detroit into Georgian Bay. Horace preferred to cruise south into the Thousand Islands. John proposed that they flip a coin for sole ownership of the yacht. Horace won the coin toss. John conceded that he would now have to go to Thousand Islands, but Horace insisted that since John was now his guest, he would take his brother to Georgian Bay." They loved each other man. They just -- they loved each other.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. This is a good – this is where I'm going to close. On their greatest accomplishment. "Over the final 7 years of their lives, John and Horace Dodge transformed their company from the largest supplier of automotive parts in the United States to a large-scale producer of a popular mid-priced car of their own design. Their formula for success was quite simple. They had complementary skills, interest and personalities while they genuinely understood and liked each other. They remained honest and fair to their customers and employees alike." "Their company survived and prospered after they died and later became a core component of the Chrysler Corporation. With their passing, the automobile industry and the greater Detroit community acknowledged their automotive significance and their important civic and charitable contributions as well. It was not the mere physical fact of brotherhood that welded these two together. It was a bond that had in it something of strange depth and purity and fineness, something that transcended the usual brother bond. For the brothers loved each other as friends. They were friends." I'll leave the story there. That's 119 books down. 1,000 to go. If you buy the book using the link in the show notes, you're going to be supporting the podcast at the same time. Stay safe, and I'll talk to you again soon.

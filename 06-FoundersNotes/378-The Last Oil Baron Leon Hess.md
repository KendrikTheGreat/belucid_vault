The book that I want to talk to you about today is called Hess: the Last Oil Baron, and it is written by Tina Davis and Jessica Resnik-Ault. I actually want to start at the very end of the book. At the end of the book, the two authors actually talk about why they decided they spent so much time studying the life of Leon Hess and why they thought writing the book was really important. They said, "We think this extraordinary man lived an extraordinary life." The reason we call Hess the last oil baron is that we believe him to be the last of his kind—the last man who could create a multi-billion-dollar, multinational, vertically integrated energy behemoth that could do everything from finding oil in far-flung fields off the coast of Indonesia to selling you a tank of gas and a pack of gum at the local station on the corner. Sixteen years after his death, Leon's legacy is starting to be erased from popular memory. This book is an attempt to capture his life, the company he created, the man he was, and the ways in which his life and industry changed the nation. He should not disappear from public view.

After reading the book, after spending the last several days rereading all of my notes and all of my highlights and really just thinking about the outline and the conversation I wanted to have with you, I couldn't agree more. He should not disappear from public view. I want to start the story of Leon Hess. I think the best way to start the story of Leon Hess is by actually talking about his father and, really, the failures of his father that, in large part, led to the success of his son. I always think of this maxim, which repeats throughout the history of entrepreneurship: you can always understand the son by the story of his father. The story of the father is embedded in the son. So Leon's dad was a failed entrepreneur. Leon's dad dabbled in many things, but he never had great success at any of them. He had strong entrepreneurial energy, and he tried his hand at a lot of things. He tried to sell produce, and he opened a bunch of butcher shops. Then he tried real estate, and finally, he tried to deliver coal. So Leon's dad began a small coal distribution business in New Jersey. This is very important. Without his dad doing this, and then Leon realizing that they were in the wrong business, there would be no Hess Oil Corporation. So during the Great Depression, Leon's dad actually went bankrupt. And as a result of this, Leon's family was unable to send him to college. He's the youngest son. The three older children all got to go to school. So even though Leon never went to college, he later succeeded in a cutthroat and highly technical business, despite lacking a "formal education." There were a series of odd jobs that Leon and his brothers did to try to help the family survive the Great Depression. One of them was that they would go down to the Jersey Shore, dig up clams, and then sell the clams to local restaurants. So they would work all day, and they'd be lucky to make 50 to 75 cents a day from digging up clams. One of the benefits that Leon got from being a kid and working for his father in a coal yard, delivering coal, is that he got used. He. He was accustomed to handling a large workload. It says the hard labor at the coal yard helped shape Leon's ethic of working long hours. He worked every weekend. You'll see, even when he had this giant, you know, vertically integrated oil company, he would still work tirelessly all the time. There are stories of him popping up at plants at 2 in the morning to check on things to make sure everything's going well. I think this is one of the most important parts of the book: he's gonna start this company at 19 years old, right? He's gonna get into the fuel delivery business. So the reason I think this is one of the most important parts of Leon's life story is because Leon realized that his dad picked the wrong business. This also shows how shrewd and smart Leon was from a young age, 'cause he's like, wait, the coal business is a dead end. We're hauling these hundred-pound bags of coal and the profit margin is tiny. And with what might be one of the most important ideas Leon ever had—arguably the most important day ever—he decides he's going to switch from delivering coal to delivering fuel oil. So I get to this part of the book. Leon reminded me of Sam Zemurray. So Sam Zemurray and Leon Hess both started multibillion-dollar family dynasties, and both started by fixing the mistakes of their father. I did not know who Sam Zemurray was. I didn't know about the Zemurray family many, many years ago. I'm actually reading this all the way back on episode 53. I was reading Mike Ovitz's excellent autobiography, which is called Who Is Mike Ovitz? In that book, it talks about Mike Ovitz brokering a deal between Seagram— which is the Bronfman family company—when Seagram bought DMCA Universal for $5.7 billion. And so that led me to start researching the Zemurray family. I found out that the patriarch of the Zemurray family is this guy named Sam Zemurray. I read his biography, and then I'd make an episode. This is episode 116, I think it was six, seven years ago. And in that episode is the very first time that I used the phrase generational inflection point, which is this idea that a single individual can change the trajectory of his entire family for generations to come. Sam Zemurray was that in the Zemurray family dynasty. Leon Hess is that for the. Leon is for the Hess family. So in that— the reason I thought of this when I was reading about Leon Hess and I got to this section of the book is because Sam was a young kid working in the family business. And he realized that his dad was doing it wrong. His dad had the wrong idea. So, Sam's dad sold horses, and every time, Sam—like a little kid—followed him around. Every time Sam's dad would sell a horse, he would take the customer to a bar for a celebratory drink. And young Sam realized, "Hey, Dad, we're on the wrong side of this transaction. We're in the wrong business—the guy selling us the drink is making more money than the guy selling the horse." And that observation, that single observation, that single idea that the young Sam Zemurray had changed the Zemurray family forever. Sam proceeded to create—went on and create, you know—the world's largest banana company. They branch out into all kinds of different businesses. To this day, the family—whether 100, 150, or 120 years later—is still one of the wealthiest families in the world.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So Leon realized, "Dad, we're in the wrong business," and proceeded to switch the product, too. So Leon saw an opportunity, and he's like, "I'm going to bet on oil—specifically fuel oil instead of coal—as a more economical way to get energy." So in his own words, later on—there are only a few quotes from Leon; he's a very quiet person—he says he started a "little oil company." So he started his little oil company in 1933. Leon was 19 years old. And as Leon describes this, you couldn't start from more humble beginnings—his entire oil company, his fuel company's fuel delivery service. He says, "I bought a secondhand truck and I started selling heating oil, and I built this company up over a number of years." So, 1933, 19 years old, one used truck—that is going to be the beginning of the Hess family dynasty. So he was going to find buyers for residual oil that refiners didn't want. What is residual oil? It's the oil that refiners didn't want. This is going to remind you—or reminded me at least—of Sam Zemurray in the book The Fish That Eat the Whale. You could think of it the same way: the same way that Sam Zemurray built his business is the same way that Leon Hess built his business, in the sense that they discovered opportunity hiding in plain sight. Literally, the product that both Sam Zemurray and Leon Hess were going to sell was just being thrown away. This is one of the most important parts of the book and of Leon's life. So Leon realized that he could sell what was called number six fuel oil. It's called residual oil; it's called black oil. Essentially, it's this heavy, almost molasses-thick oil that other refiners were just throwing away. So Leon's plan was, "Hey, I'm going to take this seven-year-old, secondhand used truck, right? It holds 615 gallons of oil. I'm going to go collect this fuel that you're throwing away anyway." So he got a good deal on it from area refineries in New Jersey and then repurposed it as a cleaner alternative to coal. So what he realized is that they call it light refining. It's really like, essentially, boiling—just boiling this black oil, this fuel oil. You could actually then go and resell it. So he sold it to businesses and manufacturers to use as heating oil. He sold it to large ships and power plants. A lot of early electricity plants would use it, and then, if you had a giant factory and you needed to heat it in the winter, you could use fuel oil for industrial heating as well. And so, when I got to this section of the book, I went and pulled out my notes and highlights for the book on Sam Zemurray, which is called The Fish That Eat the Whale. It's episode 255; you haven't listened to it yet. The parallels between Sam and Leon are remarkable because they were both 19 at the exact same time when they found what would turn out to be their life's greatest opportunity.  So I want to read some quotes here that sound exactly like what's happening in Leon Hess's life. Sam spotted an opportunity where others saw nothing. The other refiners were literally throwing this in the trash. It's exactly what Sam Zemurray did when he got, when he started in the banana trade. He started with these things called ripes, where they would come into the port and they would just throw them away because they're like, "Hey, you have to eat them in, like, the next two or three days." We can't deliver to the end customer fast enough. So let's just throw it away. So there's a quote from The Fish That Ate the Whale that describes this opportunity that was hiding in plain sight. It says, as far as he was concerned, ripes were considered trash only because Boston Fruit and other large firms were too slow-footed to cover ground. It was a calculation based on arrogance. I can be fast where others have been slow. I can hustle where others have been satisfied with the easy pickings of the trade. And I would say not only was the calculation based on arrogance, but in both Leon's case and Sam Zemurray's case, it was a calculation based on desperation. They had no other option but to succeed where others had failed. So five years later, okay, now we're in 1938. Leon now has a fleet of about 10 trucks that are buying, you know, this previously disposed fuel oil from other refiners, doing this light boiling, this light refinery, and then transferring it and delivering it to other customers throughout the East Coast. He eventually buys so much of this fuel oil that he has to buy a piece of land, purchases some secondhand oil storage tanks, and starts an oil storage terminal on this river in New Jersey. Now, keep in mind, this is one of the fascinating things about this part of the book. Leon is 24 years old at this point, and he's still living with his parents. And his dad is now working for Leon, helping him. In fact, Leon provides a job for his dad all the way until his dad was in his 90s.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so, for the first few years of his oil business, this is what his business consisted of. It says Leon cut his teeth on residual oil from refiners and built his business around the logistics of transporting oil to refineries as efficiently as possible and distributing the freshly produced fuel effectively. Now, he is very unusual—Leon is very unusual compared to most of the oil barons you might read about because, essentially, he worked backwards to the source. A lot of people, you know, write a ton of books about the people actually discovering oil, right? He actually, Leon, came into the industry incrementally. So he started with the sale of the end product before working his way backwards into fuel storage, refining, and finally oil exploration and discovery. So as a young Leon Hess was trying to build his oil business, World War II broke out. This wound up becoming exceedingly important because he was going to go to Europe. Leon actually served as the fuel supply officer for General Patton. This experience helped Leon develop a talent for logistics and moving fuel efficiently. They created this thing called the Red Ball Express. The Red Ball Express was a vital Allied logistics operation during World War II. It was established to rapidly transport supplies from Normandy to advancing troops following the D-Day invasion. So if you've ever studied General Patton—and I have a few books on him, including his autobiography, which I'll probably do an episode on eventually—one of his main things was that he was just going to move faster than everybody else. He thought speed was one of the best weapons. In fact, he's got this great speech—if you haven't listened to Patton's speech to the 3rd Army, it's one of the most famous speeches ever given. I've listened to it a bunch of times, but there are a couple of lines in it that kind of give you what was important to Patton. And so, when he says that when a man is lying in a shell hole, if he just stays there all day, a German will get to him eventually. To hell with that. My men don't dig foxholes. Foxholes only slow down an offensive. Keep moving. Later in the speech, he says, "I don't want to get any messages saying I'm holding my position. We're not holding a goddamn thing. We're advancing constantly." And Patton wouldn't have been able to advance constantly. You know, he was a tanker without this—the way to transport fuel rapidly and to follow him, essentially, as he just marches through France. And the way that he was able to unearth supplies was through the Red Ball Express, which a young Leon Hess was working on. So, the Red Ball Express was a marvel of logistics and helped ensure that the Germans crumpled under the onslaught—the onslaught of a quick-moving opposition. The Germans were still heavily reliant on moving things by horses—moving fuel and supplies by horses—which blew my mind. The Red Ball Express lasted for 81 days. In its 81 days, it created a blueprint for how to move much-needed supplies across the field of war. At its peak, 6,000 trucks were in operation, manned by 23,000 people, including drivers and mechanics. Red Ball trucks transported over 412—wow, 412,000—tons of supplies in total in 81 days. So then we get to the part where, post-World War II, he comes back to America and he's going to have this massive explosion in the size and success of his business. And so, anytime there's an idea, I assume that you have Portrait. The book Portrait is Almack. If not, I'd order it immediately. And I would go to the index of that book and read about Charlie Munger's surfing model. And so what Munger does is essentially reverse engineer why somebody was successful. And so, in that book, there are a few pages where Munger is analyzing the outside success of Les Schwab. And Munger says, anytime you have extreme success, it's usually, you know, this Lollapalooza effect. It's these multiple factors working together to create these exceptional results. And so he analyzes what the multiple factors were that contributed to Les Schwab's success. He's like riding the Japanese tire wave. He had brilliant incentive systems where he would share 50% of the profits with each of the employees who worked in each store. He was, you know, a talented fanatic. He was a gifted marketer and advertiser. He had a very systematic approach to how he executed and how he wanted all of his stores operating. And so, over a few pages, Munger is just analyzing this for us. And so I thought of this when I came back because I feel the same exact thing is happening in Leon Hess's life, where there's Leon's post-World War II wave—a series of events that were outside of his control that he surfed, which interacted with each other to produce this Lollapalooza effect. But also, he surfed magnificently. So, first of all, he comes home—he comes back to New Jersey—and he's just like, "Well, I just got essentially a world-class education in logistics. How to use trucks to move fuel." That just so happens to be the best thing that could have happened to me, considering that is my business.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay, so at this time, again, it goes back to—he's still moving fuel oil. This is that, you know, that has the consistency of molasses oil. Other oil men would call it the bottom of the barrel because it was so heavy. It was the heaviest of all the refined products. Okay, why is that important and why – at one point I think the book says that Leon has something like 80% of the market share for fuel oil. Why?  Because to move fuel oil successfully, right, you are required to move quickly and you have to have a mastery of logistics. Because if it's not kept at the right, first of all, it's not delivered fast enough. And if it's not kept warm enough, it will transform from a liquid into something that cools and hardens. So the first part of Leon's Post World War II wave is the fact that now he maybe has the most advanced logistics training of any of his competitors, and he's able to transport this faster and more efficiently than anybody else. So number one, he's just able to get the job done. Number two, fuel oil is now going to have a massive increase in demand. Demand for fuel oil surged to unprecedented levels as its use for power generation, in electricity plants, and in shipping expanded. Hess called fuel oil the workhorse fuel of industrial America for its uses in utility boilers, factory machinery, and heating large buildings. Number three, you have this massive explosion in demand for driving. The industry grew to serve a burgeoning U.S. middle class that wanted and needed to drive more. And Hess metamorphosed from a small dealer into one of the largest gasoline retailers on the East Coast. This is part of Hess's constant march to go to the source. It starts at fuel delivery, then storage, then refineries, then retail gas stations, and then finally oil drilling and exploration. Number four, this is a massive increase. This is wild to me—the expansion of the industry that Hess is operating in over 45 years. Okay, so let's start at the dawn of the 20th century when Rockefeller was at its peak, right? Production was 174,000 barrels a day. Even at that size, that could make Rockefeller probably the richest person on the planet. Right? You fast forward 45 years to where we are in the story, with a young Leon Hess building his oil company. The production is now 4.6 million barrels a day. And then number five, Leon starts building relationships and contacts which are going to lead to greater sources of capital. So if you really think about Leon's Post World War II wave—number one, he's got the logistics expertise, the right person, the right set of skills, at the right time; number two, the demand for fuel oil is exploding; number three, the U.S. economy expands, drastically increasing the purchasing power of the middle class, and as a result, demand for gasoline skyrockets; number four, America's insatiable appetite for all types of oil; and then number five, he finally unlocks relationships in capital, including going public, which I'll talk about in a minute. But I need to talk about one of maybe the most important relationships that he ever builds—this relationship with this guy named David Willins. David is almost like, essentially, his future father-in-law, but I would think of him as almost like the father that Leon chose. So David is actually the Attorney General of New Jersey. And the book says that Leon's connection to David was critical in helping shape his success. David would become his friend, his advisor, ultimately his father-in-law, and helped support Leon's transformation from coal hauler to oil baron. Leon met David before the war. In fact, while he was fighting in the war, David oversaw Leon's business. So he comes back from the war. His business had growing demand, but he was in dire need of money. And so actually, David helped Leon build a relationship with Chase Manhattan Bank. That bank at the time was being run by David Rockefeller, which is an interesting connection here. And one of the most important traits for Leon was loyalty. He expected loyalty, and he gave it in return. And so because he says he gave all of his business to Chase because of the effort they put into building the relationship with him, he says they were the only ones who ever paid any attention to me. The rest of the banks never took me seriously. David saw a lot of potential in Leon. In fact, David is the one who introduced his daughter Norma to Leon. They're going to be married for the rest of their lives. At the time when he does this, Leon doesn't have a lot of money. All the money's going back into the business. So he actually has to borrow money to buy a suit. For their first date, the contrast between their classes was obvious. It says the daughter of the Attorney General, who had grown up with a great deal of privilege, was in a different class from the owner of a fledgling fuel business. And yet David and Leon continued to share a deep connection until David died in 1988. And after David died, someone else described David's view and relationship with Leon. Says David didn't mind rich people. He liked them. But the ones he really liked started out poor, like his son-in-law, Leon, whom he loved, and it is also from David that Leon learned you have to balance work and family. So it says Hess was fully established as Leon's first child before he met Norma, and he spent long evenings and weekends dedicated to the company's birth and early upbringing. But just as David had balanced a demanding career with dinner at home each evening, Leon did the same, sometimes having to return to the office for long hours at night after spending time with his wife and children.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So then Leon continues his march to getting closer and closer to the actual source. At this point, he's buying and selling and storing fuels. And Leon wasn't going to be content with just buying oil from refineries. He's going to start his own refineries. So he actually builds his first refinery in New Jersey in 1957. So now, as a result, the company would no longer just be a middleman between refiners and their customers. It can now make its own product at its own facility. And then he starts adding other refineries, building one in Texas. But eventually, the reason I want to read this part to you—this entire section, which actually blew my mind because, again, it speaks to the size and the scope of his ambition—is that, you know, he starts out as this 19-year-old kid with a used truck, trying to make his own way in this world. Now, fast forward three decades later, he winds up building the largest refinery in the Western hemisphere, and he does so in the US Virgin Islands. Why? Why US Virgin Islands? Because the US Virgin Islands hold a key advantage. So the location that he chooses for this refinery allowed Leon to take advantage of federal tax benefits. This may be the only place in the world he could have done this. So the refinery is able to secure foreign refiner status, which allows it to circumvent federal rules that required the use of higher-cost U.S.-flagged vessels when shipping oil to the East Coast, while simultaneously, at the same time, also receiving subsidies from the United States Department of Energy as a domestic refinery. There is a line I read in the biography, The Autobiography of Trader Joe, the guy that started the grocery store that I think about over and over again. And he says, as I learned time and time again, success in business often rests on a minute reading of the regulations that impact your business. That's exactly what Leon Hess did here. He picked the one place on the planet where we had this combination of unfair advantages — and I don't mean illegal, because they're completely legal. And I want to stack another unfair advantage on top of this — or rather, Leon stacked another unfair advantage on top of this. It was going to be a local monopoly. There was only going to be one company allowed to build a refinery on the island. Leon had to win this. In fact, there's a funny interview with the governor of the Virgin Islands talking about how he negotiated — how, how Leon Hess negotiated. He says, "From the day Leon Hess entered my office, he did not leave the Virgin Islands until the deal was consummated." And then Leon also negotiated for another series of benefits. So he also got 16 years tax-free in St. Croix, partial government reimbursement for dredging a channel, and free use of that channel for 16 years. Now, this minute reading of regulations — it's not like this is a one-off. This is not something that Leon did one time. He found another loophole and another, like, regulatory advantage. Leon figured out ways to make laws work to his advantage. In one instance, he found that oil would not be considered an import [?]and thus would not be taxed as one if he bought it from St. Lucia to St. Croix by barge. So he took apart his large ships, had the engine propulsion cut in two, and the bulkheads welded on each side, and then pinned them back together. The pins were huge. So technically the drive portion could be disconnected from the cargo portion. While it may not appear so to the untrained eye, legally these boats qualified as barges. So the massive quantities of oil they carried were exempted from the taxes that would otherwise be levied. So now he has the largest refinery in the Western Hemisphere. It's perfectly located because he's able to refine oil coming from the Middle East and South America. He refines it in the U.S. Virgin Islands and then ships that fuel to customers on the East Coast of America. Now, there is an idea in here: if you're looking to do something in your business, I bet you that if you study other industries or other companies in your same industry, they attempted something in the past that was similar and yet forgotten. He's building in this, I think, in the 1960s. He wasn't the first to look in the Caribbean. He wasn't the first oil baron to build a refinery in the Caribbean. Shell built one in 1918 in Curaçao, and Standard Oil had built a refinery in Aruba in 1929. And so there's all these stories in the book about how important this one refinery was for his business. And you see this with his actions. The refinery was incredibly important to Leon. So he would fly in every Friday to inspect his refinery to review its operations, finances, and crude state. Across the refining industry, stories of Leon's persistence at the plant became legend. Leon would show up and check units at 2 a.m. to make sure they were running properly. At the same time, he's building his refineries and he's also starting to expand into gas stations. He opens his first gas station in 1960 in New Jersey. By the end of the decade, he had gas stations in 16 states. There was an interesting line here that I didn't realize. He purposely did the opposite and simplified what his gas station did compared to the existing competitors. Unlike his competitors, the head station attendants didn't change your oil. They didn't carry batteries, tires, or windshield wipers, or have car mechanics on site. And for a long time, they wouldn't even take credit cards because Leon felt that slowed the refueling process down.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so, two separate times, Hess merged with another company. This is very important. So the first time, it reads to me, he merged with this company just to take Hess public. So in 1962, Hess merged with this company called Clear Track Corporation. They used to be a Cleveland-based farm equipment maker, okay, but they had just sold off most of their equipment business the year before.  So I'm not at all — it's not at all obvious — what the company was actually doing, but this is what the book says. What Leon was getting with the purchase was a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. Hess would finally become a publicly traded company. And becoming a publicly traded company opened new sources of financing for Leon. Six years later, there's this oil exploration company called Amerida. The name comes from combining America and Canada. So in December 1968, Hess merged with Amerada [?]. This is by far the biggest deal in Hess's history. So it took a company that originated as this small-time distributor of residual oil, and now, with the combination, the business looked like a miniature version of Exxon. So the deal made Hess into a vertically integrated energy company with its hands in every single stage of oil's journey from discovery to gas tank. Leon had joined the board 11 months before the merger was announced. To get that seat, he had to make a massive investment. So Hess made a big investment two years earlier. They spent a hundred million dollars to buy a 9.7% stake in the company. And so this is another example of Leon getting closer to the source, to the actual discovery of oil. Right, and having more control over his business.  Because after he drastically expanded his refining capability, which I just told you about, he had to buy more and more oil. In fact, he became Shell's biggest single customer. And one thing that Leon was worried about is that he didn't want his company to be held captive to producers anymore. And the reason the combination of Hess and Amerada was actually interesting is that Hess was an oil refining and marketing company with no significant production facilities, while Amerada was an oil producing company with no refining or marketing facilities at all. Look how close they were to each other's production. So in the year of the merger in 1968, Hess was refining an average of a quarter million barrels of crude oil a day, and Amerada was producing about 290,000 barrels a day. And there are a lot of stories of just how wild the oil business is. In the book, there's a great line: it says the oil business is not all beer and skittles. I was on my back last week; I had bronchitis. I was super sick for almost a week, and so I wound up watching a bunch of things that I normally wouldn't have time to do. And I actually binge-watched the first season of this show called Landman, which I thought was actually pretty good. And there's a great line in Landman where he said, you know, it's, it's a show about the oil business in Texas.  And there's a great line from, you know, the billionaire head of the oil company — one of the main characters in Landman. He says, describing the oil business, "Our business is a constant state of crisis interrupted by periods of immense success." I thought that was a great way to put it. One of the crazy stories in the book is Leon's talking about, you know, how he's going all over the world to source more oil. And in some cases, you know, these are, these are dictators. And so he's actually having to negotiate with a representative of Gaddafi in Libya. And right in the middle of a negotiation, the guy just pulls out a gun and puts his pistol on the table between them. I guess it's some kind of, like, bargaining chip, or just saying, "Hey, realize who you're dealing with here." But there's one thing that I admired about Leon: he had a bit of an old-school East Coast gangster vibe. And I don't mean that as a pejorative. I mean, he believed in a handshake agreement between gentlemen. He thought it was your duty to keep your mouth shut. He would talk about, "Don't write anything down." Even when he was bribing people, he did it in an honorable way. So he writes a letter to shareholders. Remember, this is a publicly traded company, and he has to write a letter to shareholders because the regulations in the oil industry are changing. So I just want to read some excerpts from this letter to the shareholders: "In the hope of obtaining a benefit for our corporation, I made a series of payments, substantial in the aggregate, to a foreign government official." The bribery was unsuccessful. He told shareholders that the payments were made in the hope of promoting a project that never materialized. And the company received nothing as a result of the payments. The bribery money was his. It did not come from the company's coffers; he hadn't sought any reimbursement, and no deductions were taken from the payments. So again, even when he's bribing, you know, he's doing it in an honorable way. He's like, "I did it with my own money." I didn't ask for reimbursement. It didn't come from the company. I didn't ask for any reimbursements.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But the reason he brought this up is that less than a year later, the payments that Leon was writing about would be illegal because Congress enacted a new regulation called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which made overseas bribery and political contributions a crime in the United States. There's actually a pretty funny line in the book that came right after this. You know, it kind of talked about—essentially, a practice as old as cross-border trade itself was now under scrutiny. And I think it just speaks to how wild the oil business is. Like, you know, in some cases he's negotiating with people, and they're like, "Essentially, one family runs the entire country." It's like, okay, yeah—it's not just, "Oh, you can buy oil and here's the money." It's like, "Here's the price for the oil." By the way. You have to use this company, and my cousin happens to run that company; and if you need to build roads, then you have to use this road construction company. Oh yeah, that happens to be my brother-in-law. It's just, there's this wild life and industry that Leon built this massive company in. But I did think it was very fascinating that, even though the company was publicly traded, he really ran it like a family business. And one of the things I most admired about Leon was how close he was not only to his son, but to his entire family. He essentially ran it as a family venture for 80 years. It just so happened to be one of the—I think it was the 14th most valuable oil company in the world. And I think this really speaks to how his son John took over in a successor role after Leon did at John's wedding. You know, Leon was the best man. And so the book talks about the family business at length. It says the Hesses were a close-knit family. They spent time together not out of obligation, but out of general affinity. And they were fiercely loyal to one another. For Leon, his life's ventures were centered on the family. So there's a bunch of interviews and quotes from his daughters. They say he was an extraordinary father and role model. This is his daughter, Marlene Hess: His standards for himself and our family were high. He couldn't tolerate deadbeats or liars. He was a man of his word, so we had to be too. He expected the best of himself and all of us. He worked hard, and so did we. He cared deeply for his fellow man and instilled that in us, too. His other daughter, Constance, made a list of lessons that she remembered from her father. This is after her father passed away. Treasure a good name. Treasure a good name—something he'd repeat over and over again. Hold your cards close to your chest. Love is unconditional. And this is really funny: if you have to talk to the press, make sure that you're not the story. And so, as a young girl in the 1950s, his daughter Marlene said she would remember wearing her pajamas and her slippers, and returning to Leon's office with him after dinner. So, at this time, the company's headquarters were still a set of trailers. This part actually reminded me of Walt Disney. I read this 700‐page biography of Walt Disney multiple times, and there's a great excerpt from that biography about Walt Disney and the way he was with his daughters that reminded me of the way Leon Hess was with his daughters. Walt Disney would chase the girls around the house, cackling like the witch from Snow White. Or he would troll them endlessly by their heels for hours and hours. Diane would say, "That's one of Walt's daughters." Or he would stand in the swimming pool and let them climb onto his shoulders. "I thought that my father was the strongest man in the world and the most fun," Dan recalled. At night, he would read to them, and on the weekends he would take them either to Griffin Park to ride the merry‐go‐round or to the studio, where they would follow him as he snooped about and pedaled their bikes around the empty grounds while he worked. This is what Walt said. They used to go. They used to love to go with me in those days. And that was some of the happiest days of my life. They were in love with their dad. If you did not listen to the episode—that is, Episode 346, "How Walt Disney Built Himself"—it's one of the most incredible books you can read about one of the most incredible entrepreneurs to ever live outside of the office. Leon was there for his children while still running an increasingly major company. During the summer, his son would participate in swim meets. He would arrive just in time to see John swim and then get back into his car, where a driver was waiting to whisk him away back to the office. This is something that the Hess family had in common with many of the people you and I have been discussing over the past few weeks. If you look at the Wallenbergs or Hetty Green, they train their children in business. Both the Green family, the Wallenberg family, and now the Hesses train their children in business from a very young age; it's really smart. It's something Estée Lauder's family did, and something the Walton family did. This idea just reappears over again. Hess's whole social life largely spun around Leon's growing business network as they entertained bankers and colleagues at home, indoctrinating their children—especially John—in the corporation's culture and preparing John to run the rapidly expanding business. From the age of seven, John was being groomed to take over Hess.

John spent time in the trenches. This is just like the Wallenbergs and the Greens again. John spent time in the trenches learning the business by pumping gas at a station in Jersey, doing accounting for a refinery, or taking part in operations in St. Croix and the oil fields in Oklahoma. In college, John studied Arabic and Farsi, preparing for a career leading a multinational oil company. After getting his undergraduate degree at Harvard, John attended business school, striking up connections that would help him guide the company. Leon would tell his son and his daughters, "Treasure a good name." He wanted the Hess name to be recognized and respected. And so, throughout the book, his kids are talking about the way he ran his company. The people that worked inside the Hess company for multiple decades talked about this. So I made a list of really just things that reappear over and over again. Leon was extremely focused on details and appearances. Details, details, details—over and over again. He was obsessed with the details of delivery. At budget meetings, he would quiz the head of the company's trucking division on the amount of life left in the tires. There are several quotes throughout the book on the importance of cleanliness. He was obsessed with things being clean. Says, "The first thing I look at in an oil tanker is the engine room bilge. Clean bilges denote good housekeeping." He said that in 1987. Remember, he started his company in 1933. He died in 1999. He was obsessed with cleanliness in 1933. He was still obsessed with cleanliness in 1987; right from the start, he made sure his trucks were kept clean, and employees learned that working at a Hess facility meant painting and repainting to make everything look like new, whether it was a huge storage tank or the white curb at the Hess gas stations. Again, the importance of cleanliness and order is repeated. Leon realized early on that having the cleanest, safest-seeming gas stations was not only aesthetically pleasing, it could also provide a business advantage as the family car and car trips were becoming more prevalent. Hess would be the easy choice for those looking for quick service and clean bathrooms, giving him a potential leg up on rivals who did not put as much emphasis on appearances. As a manager, Leon was described as tough but fair. He had an exacting eye for detail, but he imposed the same standards on himself as he did on others. "Work hard. Work. Know everything you could about your business. And if you made a mistake, learn from it and move on." He is often described as fatherly, and no one at either the Hess company or the New York Jets—he owned the New York Jets for, like, three decades (which I'll get to in a minute)—wanted to disappoint him. This is something his players talked about, as did people on the coaching staff, the executives, and even those working in Hess refineries. They. They did not. They admired him so much. They worked hard, and they didn't want to disappoint him. Uh, he wasn't prone to emotional outbursts. He came from a school in which a handshake was sufficient for a deal. Leon was a gambler at heart. He wasn't afraid of risk. Leon ran his company with the ambition of a major oil company combined with the mindset of a startup. And one thing that he would do was capitalize on the fact that he was always on the road. He was a tireless traveler who was able to seek out opportunities where other larger oil companies were kind of a little lazier and preferred to have opportunities come to them. Leon traveled a lot for his job, and he encouraged those who worked for him to travel as well, to find new opportunities. As an entrepreneur, Leon had the opposite mindset of some of the major oil companies that let opportunities find them. He was always hungry for new prospects. He was never averse to taking risks. He loved negotiating. He was unpredictable, and he used that unpredictability to his advantage. He would take great trouble to get to know his counterparties and their families. He built very strong relationships. He had great connections all over the world. This is very similar to the Wallenbergs, if you listen to the last episode I just did. Leon knew each employee by name. He made an effort to know everyone he worked with. He even knew the name of the guy who fixed the air conditioning in his office. He had both an exacting attention to detail and an outgoing, engaging personality that made executives and industry acquaintances—who were too eager to jump into business talk at the start of a phone call—pause to talk about their wives, their children, and their lives outside of the office. This is something that's repeated over and over again in the book. This was the type of family-owned business touch that Leon favored. He also ran a more efficient business than his competitors. One competitor recounted how Leon showed them how to do more with less. He ran a facility with 400 people where other companies would have used twice as many workers. There's a great line in the book How to Make a Few Billion Dollars by Brad Jacobs, which I covered all the way up on Episode 335. About this, he says, Brad wrote: "I find that slightly understaffed teams are more focused and spend less time doing redundant, busy work. Being deliberately understaffed is a really interesting idea." The personal attention that Leon showed to his employees was repeated over and over again. Every night—at one of the refineries—he made a point of sitting down and eating dinner with the guys, and he would walk around the room and shake everybody's hand. That kind of recognition brought loyalty from many employees, many of whom would describe themselves as being very devoted to him.

Back to Leon's impressive attention to detail: he could recite the margin of every gasoline station on the East Coast. He actually spent seven hours over two days with John Mackey, the founder of Whole Foods. John Mackey can do the exact same thing. He could pass a Whole Foods and tell you what their revenue number was, what their operating income was, and what their margins were. He had this encyclopedic knowledge of the financial performance and all the numbers of Whole Foods, and it sounds exactly like what Leon Hess had in his head for all of his gas stations. Leon Hess would also do things that other competitors were not doing. I remember this from when I was a kid. It was Leon's idea. So, you remember the Hess toy trucks. I actually had these toy trucks when I was a kid, and the idea emerged from a conversation that Leon had with a friend who was also a toy manufacturer at a football game in the 1960s. So the idea initially was to create models of all the working Hess vehicles. And what I found most fascinating is that Leon was personally involved. Again, it speaks to his attention to detail. Leon was personally involved in designing each toy. So, these toy trucks start out as an idea. The idea—the original idea—was like, "Oh, these are great marketing tools." And they wind up becoming collectors' items. There are people to this day, and they, they still collect them. And some of the prices are incredible. I would have to imagine that took Leon by surprise.  I'm sure he didn't think, "Hey, I'm going to make a marketing tool. I'm going to start an oil company that manufactures toys, and it's going to wind up becoming a collector's item and, you know, something that people cherish and that reminds them of, you know, the holiday season." Decades later. Another thing that I know for a fact had to take him by surprise is how successful his investment in the New York Jets was. So, Leon actually acquired a 20% stake in the New York Jets. They weren't even called the New York Jets yet in 1963, for which he paid $250,000. And he said, "I was one of five partners." The name of the team at the time was the New York Titans. They were in bankruptcy, and we changed the name to the New York Jets. Before the purchase, the Titans were the worst-managed, most unprofessional team of the modern era. There were bounced checks, player strikes, coach shuffling, and questionable player choices. It was hardly a sure investment. So, as the years passed, Leon slowly, over many years, bought out the four other owners and eventually became the sole owner. This again speaks to how important family was to Leon Hess; for a man who didn't have hobbies, Sunday football was something he could share with his family. There's a hilarious story that really, I think, speaks to Leon's personality as well. The famous coach Bill Parcells tells a story of calling Leon one day to inform him of yet another expensive player contract. "I don't give a shit," Leon told him. "If you run out of money, come over here to the oil company, and we'll get you some more money this afternoon." So, Leon actually owned the team until he died in 1999. Now, this might surprise you. He insisted that the Jets be sold after he died. The speculation is that he insisted on this because he did not want his family to be distracted from running the oil company. Leon insisted that no member of the Hess family would be part of the purchasing syndicate in any way. Any family member that did try to own a part of the team after his death would lose a third of their inheritance. Woody Johnson of the Johnson & Johnson family fortune bought the team for $635 million in 1999. The Jets sold for almost as much as Leon's personal stake in Hess was worth at the time, or about 10 times less than what the Jets would reportedly sell for today. As for The Hess Corporation—90 years after Leon Hess started, in his own words, a little oil company with just one used truck—Chevron announced that it would acquire Hess in an all-stock deal for $53 billion.

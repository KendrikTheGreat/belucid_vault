Daniel Ek, the founder of Spotify, was kind enough to invite me to come to Sweden. And since I was going to go to Sweden, I figured I'd want to read and learn more about the most powerful family in Sweden. It's the Wallenberg family. It's actually a 170-year-old family dynasty. The book that I want to talk to you about today is called "Furthering a Fortune: Marcus Wallenberg, Swedish Banker and Industrialist" and it was written by Ulf Olsson. So Marcus Wallenberg Jr. was known as MW. That's how I'm going to refer to him throughout the entire conversation that you and I are going to have. I do want to jump right into his life. I think there are a few things I should give you as background about the Wallenberg family because he's the third generation, and there are just a couple of ideas that I think were laid as the foundation very early in the days of the family dynasty that Marcus definitely built upon. Although as you see, he was fine with the responsibility of continuing the tradition and expanding the dynasty, he was much more of an innovator than an administrator. As somebody born wealthy, you might suspect that, okay, we're already rich, we're kind of just going to maintain it. He was not interested in that. He was interested in technology, innovation, and drastically expanding the family fortune. Now there are a couple of ideas that he never deviated from. There's a line at the very beginning of the book where his actual uncle says, "Long experience in this bank has taught us that we must almost exclusively put our trust in ourselves." The Wallenbergs, and this is mentioned multiple times throughout the book, always had more liquidity than other banks and never wanted to put themselves in a position where they had to rely on the kindness of outsiders. I don't think you survive and thrive for 170 years without being relatively conservative and having this financial fortress. Remember this for later on because when MW was a young man, his job - one of the jobs in the family bank - was handling all the loans for Ivar Kreuger, which I covered all the way back on episode 348. This was one of the biggest, maybe the biggest financial scandal and financial collapse definitely in Sweden's history, but in economic history in general. And it is due to the conservative and prudent nature of the Wallenbergs and what they taught the third generation that they wind up - I'll tell you about this later - but it was pretty crazy. They actually held more collateral from Kreuger than liabilities where a lot of other banks did not. And the main competitor for the Wallenberg family actually had his life and work destroyed by his association with Ivar Kreuger. So this idea, it's like, hey, you want to have a ton of liquidity, more liquidity than the other banks. And you don't want to put yourself in a position where you have to rely on the kindness of outsiders. While I was in Sweden, I met some people who had worked with the Wallenbergs for many years. Another thing that is in the book came up over and over again: the fact that the family rarely, if ever, sold. In many cases, there were problems in the businesses they owned or invested in, and they wound up owning these for decades, in some cases over a century. What they found is that, in time, a lot of these problems could be solved or work themselves out. The bank did not content itself - and when you hear "the bank," you really have to think of the family. There was no difference between the way Marcus thought about it, the way his father thought about it, and the way the rest of the family thought about it. There's no difference between the bank and the family, the business and the family. The family is a business, and the business is a family. The bank did not content itself with writing off the lending losses but continued to maintain its interest in its debtor companies in an attempt to rescue them and, at some future date, recover as much of the bad debts as possible. I wanted to bring that up because they did this before MW was born. You'll see MW does this, and he actually carries on the tradition and really rescues, restructures, and combines a bunch of companies that the family owned for an extremely long period of time. Before MW played a role in the family business and family bank, there were multiple examples where the Wallenberg family told their employees that this was a family business that would be owned and controlled by the family. They repeated that they must endeavor to build up as large reserves as possible in the bank. In case you're listening to this and want to perpetuate a family dynasty, I'm not going to talk about the patriarch of the family, the founder of the family dynasty - his name's A.O. Wallenberg - but if you're interested in perpetuating a family dynasty, you might want to have lots of kids, because A.O. Wallenberg had 21 kids. I want to jump right into MW's life, and you're going to see traits that he had when he was a kid that he continued his entire life. There's a funny line in the book where they said that MW was a self-confident five-year-old. He showed signs of being argumentative and strong-willed from a very early age. He had a great need for independence and control - remember, he's a kid, and he's like this his whole life. He was way more defiant than his siblings, and they also said that he often got his own way thanks to his charm and powers of persuasion. The family essentially set up a track for all the kids very early on, which, for the most part, MW agrees to. He accepted that his destiny was to work in the family business and perpetuate this dynasty, but he's also going to have input and really push back on his father, even though he had a great relationship with him. I want to give you an idea of the kind of family we're dealing with, where there was no ceiling on their ambition or what they thought they could do.

After some brief military training, MW went to the Stockholm School of Economics, which was created by his family. When I went back and reread my highlights before I sat down to talk to you, I realized what was really happening. The Wallenberg family started this business school as a way to grow the entire pie and then take a percentage of that growing pie. They're interested in making more business people so they make more businesses. If there's more businesses, then they're going to own equity in some of those businesses and have a relationship - the family bank is going to have a relationship with those businesses. MW's uncle was the one who started it, and he says, "It is for knowledge and training that will raise the members of the commercial sector from the level of shopkeepers and merchants, and allow them to attain the position of respect that they occupy in other countries." They were trying to build a more sophisticated financial and business base inside Sweden. He said, "This is my first, last, and only wish with this whole idea was to promote merchant trade." There are very important personal traits that MW had, mentioned when he was a kid, teenager, and even at 80 when he's still pushing the pace and outrunning many of the young people around him: this massive competitive drive and insane level of energy. He was constantly wanting to push things forward and was addicted to technological change and investing in technology up until the day he died. What you realize is that the way he approached business, he approached everything he did. One of his great loves - really, the one love he had in his life outside of business - was tennis. He became a Swedish doubles champion and played at Wimbledon. There was nothing that he did on a recreational level - he was not trying to be amateurish at all. In fact, he took the same intensity he applied to tennis and applied it to his work. He was very intense, energetic, disciplined, physically fit, and consistent. He would engage in intense physical training. Tennis involved physical training, which made him conscious of the importance of taking regular exercise. He never abandoned his habit of doing physical exercises every morning, which stood him in good stead for the hectic pace he would keep throughout his life. Later in life, he once described himself as "a sportsman who would become a bank manager in his later days." An important explanation of his successes in various fields was his intense competitive drive. He loved to compete and believed in competition as a principle for development and progress in business and in life. One of my favorite parts about the book is all these letters back and forth between MW and his father. You see the advice that his father has and how MW kind of pushes back. But one thing that he doesn't push back on - and I think this is actually good if you're born into a situation like he is - he writes to his father when he's about 21 years old. He knew that he was going to go into the family bank, though he would expand it way past finance. He really thought of himself much more as an industrialist - he was much more interested in industry than he was in finance. But he writes to his father something very interesting, and I think there's a side idea here that you and I can benefit from. He says, "I do grant you, father, that you were right about my career being determined. There is but one possibility to make progress, to gain knowledge, in other words, to go forward." So at the very end of the book, there's a line that says, "MW was not given to introspection." This is, surprisingly, one of the most controversial observations I have from reading all these books. Many of the great founders, once they know what they want to do, I would argue actually have very low levels of introspection, almost no introspection. The reason that is important is because low introspection equals more action. You see the importance of action and moving forward with the way he ends that letter. Swedish people are typically very reserved. I was shocked at how many of the letters MW wrote used exclamation points, way more than I expected. He ends that letter to his father "Forward!" One thing that MW did not have to think about was that the family was something his father taught him, and his father's father taught him - that the family and the bank were one and the same thing. That's definitely how MW thought about it.

After finishing his military training and the Stockholm School of Economics, this was very fascinating. He mapped out his path forward. You can't just come into the bank - they weren't just going to give you a position of authority or put you right at the top. The way the family trained the next generation, which I absolutely loved and have seen a few times, insisted that they learn from the ground up. When I read to you a few weeks ago about Hetty Green's biographies - she was the single largest individual financier in the world at the time - the way she wanted to train her son, the next generation, was notable. Hetty Green was fifth generation; her family was rich for five generations before her. She said, "I want you to learn the railroads, and you're going to learn it. Even though I own the railroad and could make you CEO or president anytime I want, you're not going to do that. You're going to walk the tracks. You are literally going to pull weeds and clean up. You're going to do every single job. You are going to learn from the ground up." So what MW's father does - and they have a phenomenal network - just wait until I read about the banks where he's going to become a trainee - he literally starts in the mail room, at the lowest level possible. His father had already started to plan the next step in his son's carefully mapped-out career: periods of training with foreign banks. The work was monotonous, with all the manual duties that formed part of everyday banking at the time - sorting, checking, counting, and writing everything by hand. But this provided a basic insight into the workings of the financial system. MW's father sent him all over the world to train in various banks and see how they operate. He learned from the ground up, but there was something else repeated over and over: relationships run the world. His father emphasized that personal contacts were actually even more important as a reason for training abroad. I think Marcus Wallenberg Sr. would agree with that. I'm going to read this great advice he gives to his son, appearing in one of these letters exchanged between father and son throughout the book: "It is necessary to behave in a way befitting a well-mannered member of an established family." When MW was about to leave London, his father stressed how important it was to clear out in a decent way: "You should pay visits or write to all of those who have shown you some kindness. The most lasting relationships are created through paying attention and showing gratitude. You should take a couple of extra days doing that." So when MW is in his early 20s, his father sends him all over the world to study and train in various banks. This list is remarkable and really speaks to the relationships the Wallenberg family cultivated over generations, which they maintain to this day. He trains at Pictet in Switzerland - this bank still exists 220 years after founding. Then he moves on to Lazard in London, founded 176 years ago. In this bookshelf behind me, I have a company history of Lazard that I'll eventually get to. He then goes to Brown Brothers in New York and Crédit Lyonnais in Paris. The importance of relationships in the world became obvious to MW during his training. Because of their long-established relationships with the Wallenberg family and SEB, Marcus Wallenberg Sr. was actually able to persuade Lazard's management to take his son on as a trainee, which was totally against the bank's procedures and principles. Up until this point, MW had followed the path his father wanted him to embark on. Then we see his father discovers really early - though he probably knew this from when MW was a kid - that MW would exert his own will. MW writes to his father, "I met a woman, I love her, and I'm getting married." Obviously, if you're trying to perpetuate a family dynasty, who your kids marry is extremely important. There's a series of letters exchanged about this impending marriage. To cut to the chase, MW then and throughout his entire life would get what he wanted. He would not allow himself to be controlled by anybody. But it's fascinating to see his father trying to counsel his son about marriage. His father writes, "It is the most natural thing in the world that a young man takes a fancy to a young lady. However, it's important to decide whether or not his fancy shall be decisive for the rest of his life. When young, one tends to believe in the one and only chance; experience will modify this opinion. A marriage is not only based upon a fancy. Once the first outburst of emotion has passed, a happy marriage requires a common outlook on life, shared interests, as well as mutual respect and tolerance."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

True to his personality, when MW writes to his father about wanting to get married, he essentially presents it as a fait accompli. This is happening; I'm making this decision. It does end up happening, but his father writes in return, "I approve of your decision and congratulate you wholeheartedly. However, I do consider that a deferment is appropriate so that both parties have time for reflection. I'm more than happy to see my boys getting married and continuing our esteemed family. Experience shows that it is important not to make the wrong choice and be misled by one's feelings." Further reflection is recommended. Marriage is not the only place where he pushes back on his father. From the time he was young until he was old, MW was far more interested in industry than finance. He tells his father, "I've studied in these banks. I don't want to study in the banks anymore. I want to go out and see companies building things." His argument to his father was, "Our own bank is heavily engaged in industry. It would therefore be better to spend a month and a half gaining experience in an iron foundry, a company in the forestry sector, and an electrical company. After that, I could complete my bank training and then go to the United States and visit more iron, steel, and electrical industries." MW felt it necessary to demonstrate independence towards his father. After all, should not MW himself ultimately make the decision about his own future? The book talks extensively about what they call the "Wallenberg family sphere," which is a fascinating description. In the simplest terms, it consists of three parts: the bank; the holding company called Investor AB, which was founded in 1916 and still exists today as the second-largest company in Sweden behind Spotify; and what I would call the family office, which is really a complex web of companies and holding companies that manage the family fortune. You can see some of this structure on the family's website at wallenberg.com. It's important to point out that this is a very oversimplified way to think about it because they have an extensive network of companies. As we continue through the book, you'll see just how complicated it can get. I want to read this section about what was taking place when MW starts his career in the family business. "It is important to remember that the banking business was only one of the fields of activity in which the Wallenberg Group was engaged. There were at least two other principal activities which came under the family umbrella. The family was directly involved in industrial ownership, first through the rehabilitation of weaker companies in order to recover loan losses from their bank. Secondly, in the development of new companies that had the potential of becoming valuable customers of the bank in the future. Much of their industrial activity was carried out through the holding company, AB Investor, and its subsidiaries backed by SEB's capital resources." This is a key point: Although dominated by the Wallenberg family, the Investor group of companies was formally kept separate from the bank. Their bank and main holding company are technically separate, but they still control both. A third line of business, alongside the banking and industrial operations, was the management of the family's assets. Considerable growth was achieved by the use of finance and holding companies that could carry on financial activities on a larger scale using techniques not normally found in banking. These companies were known as "associated companies," which meant they were formally independent of the bank but still closely linked to it. Many of them were foreign companies enjoying tax and foreign exchange advantages. The family sphere consists of the initial source of the family's wealth (the bank), the way they grow the wealth (the holding company), and the family office that manages the family's assets. These are the three primary components of the sphere. There are countless companies within them. Let me give you a perfect example of why it would be difficult to put an actual price on this family's wealth. Later in the book, they're fighting with the eventual Nazi government in Germany over one of their assets. This perfectly exemplifies how complicated and widespread their family sphere became: The Wallenberg family owns a plantation in Ecuador that is run by a German limited liability company, but the principal owner and main shareholders are the Wallenberg family in Sweden. Three hundred pages into this book, when you're reading about all these different companies—MW sits on 80 different boards and is chairman of about 30 companies—it becomes almost impossible to know how many companies they own.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This brings us to two main recurring themes. First is that MW wants control and has an older brother, leading to lifelong tension. He said later that whenever he decided anything in his brother's absence, his brother would come to the next meeting and try to change it immediately. MW ultimately wins that battle for control. The second recurring theme is his extreme interest in technology. He did not view himself as an administrator but as an innovator. That was crucial to him. He stressed in his talks and company management the importance of technology, saying, "I imagine that economics quite simply means making use of technology. It is always possible to build up new industries on the basis of inventions. We can only express the hope that we shall see new epoch-making inventions emanating from Sweden that will be of benefit to the world." His next sentence explains why this was important to him and his family: "If that comes about, we may rest assured that the necessary capital for their exploitation would be made available within Sweden from the Wallenberg family and the Wallenberg family bank." Let me give you a practical example of this idea of moving into areas with technological tailwinds. This relates to their philosophy of rarely selling and maintaining a very long-term perspective. Many problems within companies become solvable given enough time, since they never sell. This is really a family case study for how problems should be handled inside companies. One of the most surprising things I learned from this book is that they really try to avoid letting bad investments die. Some people believe in spending all your time on the big winners and cutting losses. There's no wrong approach; it depends on what you want to do. But the Wallenberg family spent considerable time preventing their bad investments from failing. Because they have such a long-term horizon, they're able to wait for better times and opportunities. So there's this company called Atlas, and it's perhaps the best example of the Wallenbergs' perseverance with regard to their industrial investments within the family. This case has traditionally been regarded as a model of how industrial problems should be handled. This is where Marcus Wallenberg (MW) rapidly learned practical crisis management under the supervision of his father. Atlas was a company that had been founded in 1873 by the patriarch of the family. This company was founded by A.O. Wallenberg in 1873. The reason he started the company was because in 1873, the main technology of his day was the railroads. So they started Atlas for the purpose of producing equipment for a network of railways. I'm going to pause there. There's another maxim that jumps out when you study this family, and that's "don't let the money escape." So if A.O. Wallenberg or any Wallenberg started a company, who do you think is going to be that company's bank? SEB was Atlas's bank. Atlas became the largest mechanical engineering company in Sweden, taking up a lot of the bank's management's time and energy as well as a disproportionate share of its loan portfolio. The company's first crisis occurred after the 1870s with the decline of the railway industry. During the 1880s and 1890s, Atlas was restructured two separate times. This idea of restructuring, consolidating, and combining is something that the Wallenbergs do over and over again. Remember, they're not going to sell. They wound up changing from producing equipment for railroads into the manufacturing of air-operated tools and compressors. Around the time that Atlas switches from railroad equipment to pneumatic air compressor tools, Marcus Wallenberg Sr., MW's dad, founded a company called AB Diesel. The idea was they would manufacture engines based on Rudolf Diesel's patent. What they did was consolidate Atlas into AB Diesel. The combined company did well for a few years, in large part because this was during World War I and there was a huge demand for their products. After the war ended, there was a depression in Sweden that hit both companies very hard. Keep in mind this is 50 years after the founding of Atlas, and they're still in control of the company. They were thinking about closing down the business completely but decided not to do that. They decided to restructure it, and they had to lay off workers, going down from about 900 employees to 300. They restructured the company and wrote down the shares while maintaining full ownership and control. The family was again prepared to wait for better times.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Because they have control and financial resources and the long-term perspective, they can wait for better times. They realized their compressor and air-compressed tools division showed the greatest potential for growth, and it was being pulled down by the diesel engine division. Another thing you'll see the Wallenbergs do over and over again is maintain company ownership while dropping unsuccessful business lines and finding markets that provide tailwinds. The profits came instead from air-operated tools and compressors, a market sector that appeared to be expanding. Before the decade had ended, diesel engine manufacturing had been closed down, and the march towards a position for the company as a world leader in pneumatic technology had been initiated. By investing in the cutting edge of technology and the international marketplace, Marcus Wallenberg chose a direction that would be central to his industrial philosophy in the future. Moving on to another idea that the Wallenberg family repeats: the importance of picking associates carefully. I'm going to start with an example of somebody that did not do this, which ended up destroying his life and work. This is the section on Ivar Kreuger. Ivar Kreuger became very closely associated with Oscar Rydbeck, who had headed another bank since 1917 and who was the only person who could really compete with Marcus Wallenberg Sr. for the title of Sweden's leading banker during the 1920s. The reason this speaks to the importance of picking associates carefully is that Ivar Kreuger destroyed this man's life and work. The opposite happened to the Wallenberg family. I mentioned earlier that Marcus Wallenberg managed the Ivar Kreuger financial disaster extremely well. The family bank had refused to loan Kreuger more money before his empire collapsed, and when it did collapse, the bank actually had more collateral than liabilities. I think Ivar Kreuger is very important to study, but I already did an episode on him. If you're interested in learning more, listen to episode 348, which is about the book called "The Match King: Ivar Kreuger, the Financial Genius Behind a Century of Wall Street Scandals." In more ways than one, the Kreuger collapse demonstrates the shrewdness of the Wallenbergs' business operations. Not only were they not destroyed by the collapse, but the Wallenberg Group was drastically expanded as a result. At the time when Kreuger died—some people think it was suicide, some think he was murdered—Ericsson was in a very precarious situation because Kreuger was a majority shareholder. This combines with another Wallenberg principle: their extreme long-term outlook. The Wallenberg family still controls Ericsson a hundred years later. Ericsson is jointly controlled by the Wallenbergs and Handelsbanken. They both acquired their voting strong A shares and thus control of Ericsson after Kreuger's fall. Before I move on to introduce this idea that they don't let the money escape, which I found fascinating, I want to share the book's notes about where the Wallenberg family is today. The Wallenberg family is one of Sweden's most prominent business dynasties, controlling a significant sphere of influence in Swedish and Nordic businesses through their investment companies and foundations. The core of their business empire centers around Investor AB. This is what I mentioned earlier—it's the second most valuable public company in Sweden right now behind Spotify. Investor AB, their main investment company founded in 1916, holds large ownership stakes in major Swedish multinational companies like Ericsson in telecommunications, Atlas in industrial equipment, ABB in engineering, AstraZeneca in pharmaceuticals, and SEB in banking. The Wallenbergs are known for their long-term investment approach and active ownership style, often placing family members or trusted associates on the boards of companies they invest in. They emphasize substance over appearance and long-term value creation over short-term gains. I'm going to read one more thing before we go back to the book, which was just blew my mind when I started reading about Marcus Wallenberg Jr. Before I read his biography, MW's impact on Swedish industry was so substantial that during the 1970s, Wallenberg family businesses employed about 40% of Sweden's industrial workforce and represented 40% of the total worth of the stock market in Sweden. Now, I wanted to read that to you because I think this idea—and again, I took this idea from the book and just compressed it down to a maxim for you—"Don't let the money escape" is one way they do this. So you're the preferred partner, right? You have this network of companies, who knows the count. Even if they're separate legal structures, they're heavily controlled by one family and people that they trust. It's your preferred partner for every single thing that should be inside the Wallenberg sphere.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So they take control of Ericsson, okay? They wind up going to the government of Finland, and the family bank, SCB, says, "Hey, we are going to loan you, government of Finland, $4 million from our bank so you can then spend that money that came from our bank and give it to Ericsson so they can expand your network, your telecommunications network." And then Ericsson, you're going to have an agreement with SCB that we get at least 37.5% of all of your banking business. Don't let the money escape. Their associated companies almost always had to use the family bank. Now, without a doubt, since this is the biography of Marcus Wallenberg Jr.—of MW, right—he's been the main character, the supporting character. The most other important character in this book is, without a doubt, his father. And his father's life motto actually becomes the family's motto and is still to this day. It's on their website over and over again. It's also in this book. It translates from Latin: "To be, not to seem." And one way he described it to his sons, because he's about to pass away—and then we're going to get into really how his sons are now writing back to each other, to their friends, and to their associates about the impact that their father had in their lives—but the way he described it to his sons was it was the importance of being sincere and true to oneself. So this part is absolutely incredible. I'm gonna read the whole thing. I'm gonna give you my outline, my notes, before I read it to you: Number one, admiration for his father; number two, the importance of innovating and creating something new; number three, his idea that we need to be epoch makers; number four, the traits that MW most admired from his father; and number five, the importance of—again, this is repeated, they just have a handful of ideas that they repeat over and over again like everybody else—surround yourself with great people. This is something the Wallenbergs repeat. MW wrote right after the death of his father: "You probably know better than most people what a wonderful father, friend, comrade, and mentor he was, and the strength of the ties we had developed with him. He has left a great void, but his spirit is so strong that it will live on forever among many of us." What MW inherited from his father and turned to his own advantage was the ability to create something new. He wrote: "For the sake of civilization, I sincerely hope that the epoch of bold and constructive innovation has not come to an end with the passing away of my father. Innovation goes on constantly and is stronger than any regulation. The fact that he was often seen as the soul of an epoch or regarded as an epoch maker was probably due to his unusual qualities. Should other men of the same caliber emerge, I believe they will also be seen as epoch makers." MW continues to describe his father: "He was extremely versatile. He had a phenomenal memory and was very knowledgeable in all kinds of sciences and literature. He enjoyed music and knew about different technologies, and he mastered languages as well!" There's all these exclamation points again—I'm really surprised by these very reserved Swedes, how often MW used exclamation points. I do the same, so I love it. "He was very interested in history and would tell stories about his various companies and about the difficulties he had encountered. He was talented, first of all, in terms of wisdom and intelligence, but he also had great judgment, industriousness, energy, and he also enjoyed good health and had a sense of responsibility." Really, the reason I'm reading this to you is because he's describing his father, but now that I know the full arc of MW's life, you could use the same description of him as well. He often used to say, "I find it difficult not to intervene when I see things going wrong." One thing that I think is very important is that he was very good at picking good collaborators. With the passing of his father, this is not going to surprise you based on the personality and everything you and I have discussed up to this point—MW is going to become the most prominent and powerful person inside the family, even though he's the second son. That is why the book is called "Furthering a Fortune." The way he furthers the Wallenberg family fortune is because he had this obsession not with finance, but with industry. I'm shocked at how much of the book covers the restructuring, reviving, and combining of all the different companies that they "invest in." But really, I don't think of them as investors. They are very much operators, almost like co-founders in a lot of these cases—they're on the board, they wield a hell of a lot of influence and control. MW talks about the fact that if you own something for a long period, it's going to have ups and downs. He talks about their approach to fixing ailing companies: "First, the bank's management examines the company's position and they identify where the true losses lay. Then, with a very realistic approach, a judgment has to be made as to whether the company could succeed if given a fresh start." Sometimes that means combining companies, sometimes that's shedding business units that were not performing well, sometimes it means writing it down and recapitalizing it. Then he says the company's bank must often become involved on a long-term basis. In the interaction between the family bank and the company's management, MW says over and over that the personal element of the relationships was of the greatest importance. He goes back to why relationships are so important: Let's say we have an ailing company, we've recapitalized it, we've combined, we've got new management, we've done whatever we can. Now what? What do we do next to make it grow?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The management of the bank, which you can think of as the family, often committed itself to trying to secure markets—meaning customers—for the resurgent company through judicious use of their contacts. Here's a description of some of the ways that MW implements and exerts his influence: They believe in long-term and active investment. When he became the managing director of the bank, he was able to mobilize all of its resources. He established a system of active ownership. What does that mean? This is what he did: He hired a staff function for the gathering of information. Economists and technicians were recruited. A legal department employing professional lawyers was set up, and files on potential managers were kept and so on. He's essentially helping them recruit as well. When you go through this whole section, I was summarizing all the different things that he was doing here. I realized, wait a minute, this guy sets up a business inside of a business, which is the bank, that is in the business of managing businesses. That's really what he did. That is not a short-term and passive investor. M.W. goes about marshaling his leadership and storytelling abilities because he and his brother have this dynamic tension over and over again. His brother is the administrator, he is the innovator. Their family motto would be "to shift from the old to that which is coming." We saw this in the case study on Atlas – this company founded by A.O. Wallenberg in the 1870s that they manage and successfully shift from the old railways, all the way to diesel engines, all the way to becoming the leading company in pneumatic and air compressor tools. He's writing a letter to his brother expressing his views on enterprise and development. He says, "To sell a railway in order to buy into airlines – in other words, to shift from the old to that which is coming, which has been the motto for the business activities of early generations of our family – is the only tradition worth caring for, in which our ancestors would like to see us maintain." M.W. was not shy. He was a very direct person. He was not shy about saying that he thought he was better suited to take care of the family's industrial traditions. We are expanding not just from a bank. We have all kinds of businesses. These businesses are growing rapidly. This is between pre- and post-World War I and pre- and post-World War II. You have these massive economic explosions, and M.W. is constantly criticizing. He says his brother is too passive and more of an administrator than an innovator. There was, without a doubt, a difference in their temperaments. M.W. was impatient, curious about technology, and untiring in his following up on business matters, whereas Jacob was often analytical – too analytical, in M.W.'s opinion – frequently delaying decisions and giving freer rein to executive managers. The reason I think this part is so important is not just to talk about the differences in personalities between the two brothers, but what is very obvious. Think about the description of a 5-year-old M.W. that we talked about – now he's 40 or 45 years old where we are in the story. M.W. is doing exactly what Charlie Munger would tell him to do, which is to follow your natural drift. You see his natural drift manifest through his personality, through his actions. You also see it when he plays golf. When M.W. played a round of golf, he would aim straight for the green, even if the course were difficult and curving. Jacob preferred to hit two safe strokes. Now remember, M.W.'s father is dead. Go back to the advice he had given his son: "You're young, you're excited. You met this sexy lady. You have all these feelings. You need to have a calm head." His father's passed away. M.W. gets a divorce, and then he does two of the craziest things I've ever read about. One indication that his first wife and he were not going to last very long is because one of her favorite expressions to repeat was, "There's more to life than business." Not for M.W. Here are two crazy things. First, M.W. is going to marry or steal the wife of the king's nephew. Okay, this goes back. Remember, he was having a really hard time—and not even a hard time, he wasn't. I guess he might not even be trying. He would refuse compromise for convention's sake. And his dad, you see his dad earlier trying to counsel his son through letters and conversations: "There are certain things expected of you. You're kind of acting more willfully, a little wild than expected."

On a transatlantic cruise with a group of people leaving from Sweden going to a wedding in America, while his wife is pregnant with their third child back in Sweden, he meets this woman who will become his new wife – Marianne Bernadotte. At the time, Marianne is married to Count Carl Bernadotte. Count Carl is the son of Prince Oscar, who is the brother of King Gustav V. Despite both being married, they fall in love and prepare to dissolve their marriages quickly to unite. Keep in mind, if divorce was frowned upon by the Wallenberg family, which it definitely was, it was a positive scandal for the Bernadotte family. A member of the royal family had been abandoned by his wife. It gets even more awkward – M.W. used to play tennis with the king, and now he had just stolen the wife of the king's nephew. Needless to say, it took some time before M.W. and his new wife were invited to the royal palace for dinner. That is the first wild thing he does in his personal life. Here is the second: It is very highly likely that M.W. winds up setting up the next marriage for his first wife because she marries a close associate of the Wallenberg family. His ex-wife marries Charles Hambro, a member of a well-known family of bankers. The Wallenberg bank owned shares in the Hambro's bank, and M.W. and Charles knew each other. M.W.'s children would later say, jokingly or not, that their father had probably arranged his wife's second marriage. The thing that ties all this together is really just that M.W. gets what M.W. wants. He winds up wrestling control of the family bank from his brother, and every single thing that he wants to control, whether it's the family's industrial holding company or the bank – anytime he wants to control something, he winds up getting control of it. From here on in, for the rest of his life, he's going to push the pace. Up until his 80s, he works until he dies. In fact, he's training all the young people around him, and they just cannot believe the amount of energy this guy has. I want to go over the very unique way – because granted, he really has no regard for convention or just continuing down a path because somebody else in his family beforehand continued on that path. In everything he does, he injects some kind of new idea. He takes over the management of the family bank and institutes something he calls "morning prayers." He gathers his top people, and each would give an account of their respective areas of responsibility, report major individual transactions, and exchange general information. In this way, M.W. could keep abreast of developments within the bank and be at the center of the flow of information. It's kind of like an analog, low-tech way – if you listened to the Jensen Huang episode I did last week – where both M.W. and Jensen, and a lot of history's great entrepreneurs, they want unimpeded information and a lot of it. And so Jensen has this idea where he says, "Hey, every single person in the company is going to write, I think once a week, this Top Five Things - this T5T email. You're going to put in bullet points. I'm going to read hundreds of them every week, and I'm going to have this unimpeded flow of information." MW's analog version of that is gathering all his people together very quickly. In many cases, they mentioned the fact that these meetings go really fast, like 15 minutes, and he's going to get this unimpeded information on a daily basis from the people in his company. Another thing that was very unusual, given the industry they're in and how reserved the family was: MW is the first person who actually starts advertising the bank's services publicly because he wants to grow. In the early 1950s, the bank, which normally took a low profile with the media, advertised that it was at the service of private enterprise. He starts making the bank invest heavily in technology. In technology of their day, they have these punch card machines. He buys a bunch of punch card machines and ensures that all accounting transactions inside of the bank are no longer done by hand. They have to be done on the technology of their day, which is the punch card machines. This results in all accounting transactions being transferred to punch cards, which led to a dramatic increase in efficiency. Productivity doubled. Twice as many transactions were carried out by a workforce that only had to increase from 425 employees to 550. They add 125 employees, but they do double the amount of work because of MW's insistence on investing in technology to push these massive increases in productivity that technology enables.

Remember, he wrestled control of the family bank from his older brother. We're going to get a lot more details on how he decided to run his business. There are obviously many differences between his brother Jacob and him, but there are also going to be a lot of parallels. When I got to this section, I thought a lot about Steve Jobs and Jensen Huang. MW was a highly visible driving force in the bank. Jacob had adopted a low profile; the employees did not see much of him. MW had a different way of communicating with the staff - he got to know everybody. MW is a big proponent of management by walking around. He liked to walk around the office asking what the different employees were doing. The pace of work in the bank increased. MW would express his dissatisfaction with somebody in front of other people. Just like Jensen was a big proponent of public criticism, he talked about the fact that you should criticize publicly because it should be a learning experience for the entire company. If you criticize privately, only you and that individual employee actually learn the lesson. Jensen was optimizing, just like MW is optimizing, for the overall learning of the entire company. MW would become irritated and lose his temper, but there was often a sound intention behind his outbursts. He considered it useful for others to understand what it meant to work for him. That reminds me of Jensen as well. Not keeping him informed of what was going on was a mortal sin. Jensen almost says that exact same thing - it's spooky how similar this is. MW himself wanted detailed information, even on apparently trivial matters. He wanted to draw the conclusions himself. Reports containing the writer's own reflections he would call "half-chewed food." I had a weird thought when I got to this section because this reminds me of Steve Jobs, who would insist on improving every single ad that Apple did before it went out. The people who made the ads in meetings with Jobs would try to put the ad in front of him and tell him a story, and Jobs would tell them to shut up. He'd say, "Are you going to be there when I see this billboard or when I'm having coffee on a Sunday morning and seeing this Apple ad in a newspaper?" And they'd say "No," and he'd say "Exactly, so be quiet. I want to be able to judge and draw the conclusions myself." Another side of MW's leadership style was that once he had told someone off, he would quickly let the matter pass. It did not linger. Now, one striking way that MW deviated from both Steve Jobs and Jensen: Steve focused on running Apple the whole time, Jensen focused on running NVIDIA the whole time. MW was the chairman of the board for 33 separate companies and on the board of another 80 companies. His style, I would say, is much more in line with what Sam Zell said, where he set up all of his companies. Sam said, "I am the chairman of everything and the CEO of nothing." There are a couple of other things, and I just made a list because they reappear over and over again. So I just made a list of how I think about MW's entrepreneurial philosophy: 1. He wants to invest in technology. 2. He wants decisive influence over the company he is working on or investing in. 3 He is going to impatiently push things forward constantly. 4 Which leads to what seems paradoxical: MW's short-term impatience combined with the long-term perseverance of the Wallenberg family in their industrial matters. 5. The quality of the people is most important. In fact, let me interrupt the list. I'm going to read this section too, and I'll get back to my list. When judging companies, MW considered that the capacity of its top people was generally the most important ingredient. He therefore chose executive managers with great care. He kept himself well informed about new names, drove his managers extremely hard, and moved others aside if they were not up to the task. Those of his own generation who had allied themselves closely with him earlier were gradually moved to one side in favor of new blood. He demanded unlimited work and loyalty from his managing directors in all of his industrial companies. So, continuing the list: 5. The quality of the people is most important. 6. He believed in driving people hard. 7. He wanted new blood. 8. He had tons of expansive energy for new initiatives. 9. One of his favorite sayings that he would repeat: "Ownership without presence rots."

What does he mean? Go in person, be seen, be prepared. It's also important to him to study industrial operations firsthand, to forge contacts with on-site personnel, and to be visible. He liked to prepare himself well before his visits and liked to surprise people with unexpected questions, often quite detailed ones. The managing director on site could never feel absolutely safe, which of course was MW's intention. Here's what a meeting with MW was like from the perspective of one of his company's directors. This is going to remind you again of Sam Zell, Jay Pritzker, Bernardo Hees - they have all been described in a similar way that MW is going to be described from one of his directors. Monthly reports, sales statistics, and minutes for meetings were reviewed. MW had a unique talent for putting his finger on the exact figure or point which you had not analyzed sufficiently or about which you did not know all the answers. The outstanding ability he possessed to analyze a report quickly was certainly acquired through a lifelong experience of scrutinizing statistical information and annual reports. He had a unique ability of quickly putting his finger on the weak points and of asking difficult questions. Sam Zell, Jay Pritzker, Bernardo Null have all been described in that exact same way. Now, this is not to say that, as you can imagine, this kind of domineering personality wasn't a difficult personality. There were going to be people who were loyal to him, and there were going to be people who weren't. In fact, one of his main directors in one of the holding companies actually described MW as both a great man and a small one. This part I thought was a great description, so I'm going to read the entire thing to you, and I think it really gives us a sense of who MW was: "His greatness was incontestable and worthy of all of our admiration. It was based on a deep sense of responsibility for Sweden as a country, and in particular for the Swedish economy. He spent all of his expertise, energies, and time on the task of developing and, in many cases, rescuing companies. This was his life. Everything and everybody was subordinated to his mission in life." "What do I mean then by saying that he was a small man in certain respects? I certainly do not exaggerate when I say that he was notorious for striking terror into the hearts of many of his direct and indirect subordinates. He could be merciless. Even relatively trivial issues could cause dreadful outbursts of anger. It is mainly this merciless side of him that I have in mind when I speak about being a little man. A thoroughly great and just person does not treat his fellow human beings like that." I want to pause there before I go into the greatest tragedy of MW's life, because I read that part and I really thought about this. I told you before, I have a very negative inner monologue, and one of the reasons I work by myself is I don't want to express—I don't want to talk to other people the way I talk to myself. If you were to ask Charlie Munger—and I got to talk to Charlie Munger about this before he died—who he thought the greatest entrepreneur of all time was, he would say Rockefeller. One of the most fascinating things about Rockefeller is that obviously, the people you and I study together, many of them are ruthless. There are numerous examples of them being incredibly harsh and mean to people around them. But that's on one end of the spectrum. I've said before, that's not a prerequisite to success. You have literally the guy that Munger says is the best to ever do it, and people worked for him for decades who said they not only never heard him raise his voice—they never heard him say an unkind word. Now, of course, I'm not naive. Rockefeller's competitors would not describe him as a nice person with etiquette and manners. As I get older and I'm exposed to other people who are wildly successful and also not difficult people, I think etiquette and manners become more important and admirable to me. Maybe because I see that's an area in my own life where I have vast room for improvement, and so it's almost aspirational. I don't want to get to the end of my life and be described by people like that—that say he was a small person, a little man. I want to rip through these ideas in a fast manner and be respectful of your time, but I do think pausing there is really important—just how do we want to be described after we're gone? Then, I'm not going to say it's the cause for what happens next, which is by far the greatest tragedy in MW's life, but it is interesting that it follows in the book like this. Marcus Jr., who is MW's grown son—this is towards the end of MW's life when he's probably 70 years old—Marcus Jr. is obviously running parts of the company, the family business. He's being trained as MW's successor. He makes a mistake when he gives an interview and is asked why the Wallenbergs started building a new pulp factory in Germany without having received permission from the authorities.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He answered honestly but imprudently that it was "preferable to be prosecuted for breaking environmental laws than to paying large damages for breach of contract to a German buyer of pulp." His reply aroused a great deal of attention and was reported throughout the press. He could expect to receive sharp comments from MW. Sure enough, at the board meeting that afternoon, he was severely reprimanded by his father. His father then closes the meeting and leaves Sweden to fly to London. The next morning, MW wakes up and gets an alarming report that Marcus Jr. had not appeared at his scheduled Friday morning meetings, nor had he spent the night at his house. MW flies back to Sweden. When he gets back to Stockholm, he is met by somebody who works with them and is told the dreadful news that his son had killed himself. Marcus Jr. went into the forest that afternoon and shot himself. The book describes the days after this happens. "I don't have words for this," says MW, who did not outwardly reveal any sorrow or possible remorse. He told one family member, "Remember that in a crisis, we Wallenbergs are ice cold." There's another interview in the book that says, "I remember I was standing talking with MW at Marcus Jr.'s funeral. MW looked at his watch and said, 'At 3 PM, there's a board meeting at the bank.' Only now do I understand the importance of these words. You have to force yourself to carry on and to return to normal life again." One of the saddest lines in the book is about Marcus's son, Husky, who is MW's grandson. It says MW took care of Husky—the ties between them reflected that it was a father who had lost his son and a son who had lost his father. For the remaining 10 to 12 years of MW's life, he spent the time trying to train the generation and the next generation after him for the perpetuation of this family dynasty. I think this is a fitting way to close on MW's life. He passes away when he's 82. This is a straightforward and simple theme rammed throughout MW's life. He had accepted responsibility early on for taking over the family's heritage and traditions from his parents with almost religious fervor. His father preached to him about the importance of fulfilling this duty. In spite of crises, conflicts, and shifting political winds, MW carried out his task with remarkable consistency and strength. MW's whole life was colored by this overwhelming task. Anything else would have been a betrayal of his destiny. And that is where I'll leave it.

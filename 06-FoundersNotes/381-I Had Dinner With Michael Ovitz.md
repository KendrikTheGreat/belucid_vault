TEST4.
PELASE

Okay, last week I flew to New York to have dinner with Mike Ovitz. We ended up having a very intense and entertaining three-hour conversation. I made a list of things I learned from the dinner, so I'm going to run through some of these ideas. I guess I should back up and tell you how I actually got connected to Ovitz. We wound up having a very close mutual friend. I was having breakfast with my friend Rick when his phone, which was on the table, rang and displayed "Michael Ovitz." It was like, "Oh, wow." So he picked it up and said, "Hey, I'm actually here with my friend David Senra. He does that podcast you might have heard of—Founders." And then there was a short break. Then Ovitz said, "I listened to four of them yesterday." So we wound up getting connected. We were already planning on having a meeting and dinner anyway, and I said, as you might know, I do these dinner episodes—I've done one with Charlie Munger, Sam Zell, Brad Jacobs, and John Mackey—and I thought it would be really interesting. Would you be up to doing it? He said yes, so I flew up to see him. The conversation was really intense. It flew by—like I said, it was three hours. I was shocked when I got up from the table and thought maybe we had talked for only an hour. Right after dinner, I didn't record any of this, nor did I take notes while we were having the conversation. I just wrote down some of the things that really stood out to me and then tried to expound on them. I have a list of about 10 ideas I want to go over with you from this dinner. And the first one is very obvious. If you read his autobiography—which I'm also doing an episode on, and I think I'll release it at the same time—and if you spend any time with him or hear him speak in any capacity, there's this great line that I use as a guide to make sure I'm on the right path.  It says, "Mediocrity is always invisible until passion shows up and exposes it." This is very obvious if you look at his career, and he's still this to this day. What I would say is that Ovitz does nothing in a casual manner. I don't either, and I don't think any of the founders that you and I study or read biographies about do either. One of my favorite examples of this is when he was a young kid and started working in the mailroom at William Morris. I believe the book mentioned there were about 20 other trainees—he was one of 20—and out of those, only one did what he did. He noticed, "Hey, there's this filing cabinet room—the length of a basketball court, lined with steel cabinets." He called it the hard drives of the era. There were no computers back then, no internet, nothing like that. What he realized is this: these filing cabinets, which are the length of a basketball court, actually hold 70 years of Hollywood history. He said, "I viewed those files as an encyclopedia of entertainment." While other trainees wanted to be told what to do and read and learn each morning at seven and every evening after work for ten weeks, I made my way through every single file from A to Z. How many other trainees did that? Zero.

He did this over and over again. There are a bunch of different examples. One of my favorite stories from the book, too, was when he was trying to sign a very important director who, at the time, was being represented by an aging and really apathetic agent. So, keeping in mind that mediocrity is always invisible until passion shows up and exposes it, Ovitz persisted. Maybe the director thought, "Hey, I've been with this agent for a while. It seems to be going well, seems to be fine." Then you have somebody with passion showing up and exposing how mediocre your alternative is. He ended up working on this director for two hours a day for two years before the director signed with them. One of the smartest things Ovitz did was to make sure he got every single script—the best scripts—to him before the director's own agent could. Essentially, he worked on the director's behalf, showing him how important it was and demonstrating that the difference between your apathetic agent and him is vast. So, mediocrity is always invisible until passion shows up and exposes it. The second thing that popped into my mind is: don't put any ceiling on how far you can push your profession. Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan actually shared the same trainer—this guy named Tim Grover—who wrote two books about what it was like working very closely with them, spending every day with them. Two lines in particular popped into my mind after my conversation with Ovitz. Tim Grover wrote, "The greats figure out what works for them regardless of what everyone else does." And number two, while everyone wanted to be like Mike, Mike did not want to be like anyone else. And so, if you analyze it, there were talent agents before Michael Ovitz was born, and there are talent agents to this day. Yet one of the most fascinating things about his story is that he figured out what worked for him. He didn't really care what other agents were doing. In fact, he may have looked at what other agents were doing as examples of what not to do or what to do—essentially to attack areas they weren't covering. So one of his innovations was the decision that, "hey, we're all going to service." Every single agent inside CA is going to service the clients together. It's essentially like a giant swarm of agents; in the past, you were assigned to one person. You only worked with one person, and that caused all kinds of internal conflict. It was much better to have five people servicing you than one person, which worked out better for the talent CA assigned. And then he didn't just stay there. He's like, "Oh, okay, what are we supposed to do?" There's a great story about what most talent agents would do. They would field offers. For example, there are 10 offers. We have to choose between them. Maybe we negotiated for slightly higher salary cases; however, instead of fielding opportunities, we decided to create them. And then that led to the next step: we were going to create entire packages for the studios, which also helped him control prices and generate more revenue for the agency. And then from there, he thought, "What else can I do?" I'm going to get into corporate M&A. No other talent agency—none of his competitors were even thinking like this. And his ambition had no ceiling; he believed you should never put any ceiling on where you can push your profession. You just pursue the opportunities and chase after them. He ends up brokering multiple billion‑dollar deals. I think one of them was about six and a half billion dollars. Again, no other competitor—no other agent—was doing this. He doesn't stop there. He says, "We're going to start being marketing and advertising consultants for giant companies like Coca‑Cola." And one of the things he said at dinner was, "If you're going to do things like this—when you do new things—you will be criticized, and in that case, you'll be criticized by outsiders, by people outside your company." Now, number two: no ceiling. Don't put any ceiling on where you can push your profession. This ties into number three, because for number two, you're going to be criticized by people outside your company. Number three is: I grew up going to a Christian church every week for my entire childhood. And I remember one of the lessons they would repeat over and over again: don't be unequally yoked. And I think they meant that in relationships in general. But I specifically remember saying, "Make sure you're not married." You don't marry people outside of the faith who have different beliefs than you. And the advice from Ovitz is: you need to make sure that you're picking partners who share the same level of ambition. And so when I think about that, I think, "Don't be unequally yoked." And when you have no ceiling on how far you push your profession, you'll be criticized by outsiders because you're doing new things. But if you have chosen partners who don't share your level of ambition and you try to do new things—like all the things I just listed—you'll also be criticized by insiders, such as your co‑founders, and it will lead to a lot of conflict. And there are all kinds of stories in his autobiography, which I'll go over in the episode I make on it. It's a huge part of the story.

And he says this will manifest. He was saying at dinner that the way this manifests is that your partners will call it a distraction. And if you truly believe in it, it's probably not a distraction. It's just that they're not thinking as big as you are, and you might find yourself... He didn't use this word, but "unequally yoked" is the way I think about it. When we talked about the issues with co‑founders and how to avoid all this—and really what he learned from it—I found it remarkable because I know he now has new partners and is scaling other companies, and I know his partner. I asked, "How are you able to trust?" Because two of his partners who screwed him over were two of his best friends, too. And so I asked him, "How do you trust partners after being fucked over?" I thought his answer was: "Because I keep people at arm's length." I have a hard time trusting other people. And that may be a detriment. And he had a great perspective on this. He's like, "Three people screwed me over in my life." He's like, "But it's three out of a thousand." And he's not going to let three out of a thousand people foreclose any future opportunity. And being able to partner with people who aren't going to screw him over was really interesting. Number four: read biographies. Know everything about the history of your industry. There's a line—this is tied to a line that Ovitz said to me, where he said, "Only founders understand founders." So the first thing that popped into my mind is that on page 179 of his autobiography, he talks about Lou. He modeled himself after Lou Wasserman. I have a biography on Lou. I think it's called the Last Mogul or the Last Tycoon. The Last. He was the last Hollywood mogul. And I asked Ovitz at dinner, "Do you still think Lou Wasserman was the best?" And he said, "Yes." And one of the benefits of reading biographies is evident—Ovitz started doing this. He started working when he was nine years old. By the time he was in high school, he was voraciously reading biographies of men who did great things. And he read about Carnegie, Rockefeller, and all these people. He read all the biographies of all the people in Hollywood who came before him. And I think the important point he's making is that only founders understand founders. And so, as you understand these life stories—as you listen to this podcast and read biographies yourself—you'll realize, "Oh, that's just another me." And we're going through the exact same thing. He actually gave me advice, too. He said, "You should really lean into the more unknown founders." Because he had read about the Vanderbilts, the Rockefellers, the Carnegies, and the Fords. But he thought it was an edge to introduce people to other incredible founders that very few people had heard of before. So, consider Daniel Ludwig, the Invisible Billionaire; Chung Ju-yung, whose autobiography is the craziest I've ever read; Sam Zemurray and Estée Lauder, another example. Even if you know the company name, very few people probably thought, "Oh, I should see if that person has built this massive company." I wonder if they have an autobiography or a biography written about them. And then even fewer people would actually go and read it. So, again, read biographies, know everything about the history of your industry. Number five: have a profound sense of belief. And as you'll understand, the world is also malleable. So there's a reason this is number five. And read biographies. Number four, because you learn this if you read a bunch of biographies. One of the things I most admire about Ovitz—there are many things—is that I love the fact that this guy never gives up and he's still pushing himself. He's in his late 70s, and he has tons of energy and is working really hard. But he has a great line in his autobiography where he says, "Nothing in Hollywood is anything until it's something." And the only way to make it something is with a profound display of belief. If you keep insisting that a shifting set of possibilities is a movie, it eventually becomes one. Marc Andreessen, who modeled his venture firm Andreessen Horowitz on what Ovitz did at CAA, had a very similar line. This is the way he describes what I feel is the same exact phenomenon. Marc wrote, "The world is a very malleable place if you know what you want and you go for it with maximum energy, drive, and passion—the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think." Ovitz doesn't see things as they are now. He sees what they could be. And then he proceeds to make that idea into a reality. Number six, when you speak to him, I got the feeling that he thought there was unlimited opportunity in the world. Surprisingly enough, I think something he learned earlier—and I think it still applies to this day—is that there's a lot of opportunity hiding in plain sight. I think you have some level of self-confidence when you're able to pick something up off the ground—something that people threw away or didn't do anything with—and turn it into something insanely valuable. I think that's related to number two: don't put a ceiling on your profession. There's no ceiling on how far you can push it. There's a ton of examples in the book. He turned Shogun into this massive miniseries. I think it's the second most-watched miniseries of all time. That opportunity was sitting within another agency, which wasn't doing anything with it for years. He finds another script for this movie called Tootsie. For six years, it was considered dead. This was impossible; this wasn't an opportunity, yet he winds up making a couple hundred million dollars in profit. Rain Man, which is one of my favorite movies—I watched it countless times when I was a kid. Same thing; other people couldn't get it done. Other people said, "No one's going to watch this movie about an autistic guy," yet it made well over $400 million.

There's always opportunity hiding in plain sight, and there's unlimited opportunity in the world. I feel like this has been coming up a lot. If you look at the past few episodes—think about Leon Hess. Leon Hess literally built the Hess family business and just sold it for $53 billion. How does that business start? That starts with Leon Hess, who realizes, "Hey, you're throwing out a bunch of oil because you think it's not valuable, I'm going to start my empire with the stuff that you're throwing away." Just like Sam Zamuri did the exact same thing with his banana trade. You're throwing out the ripe ones. That's what you're throwing into the trash. I see that—I don't see it as trash; I see it as opportunity hiding in plain sight. Jerry Jones, Dallas Cowboys—he paid 140 million for them. They're worth 10 billion today. 75 people turned down the opportunity to buy the Cowboys before Jerry Jones did. If you're capable of thinking for yourself, if you have profound self-belief, there's always opportunity hiding in plain sight. Number seven, by endurance, we conquer. One of my favorite lines—it's probably my favorite line in the entire book—and I don't remember the context of our dinner discussion, but we did talk about this and we both look at it the same way. This line says "he stopped because it was hard—it required discipline, dedication, and countless hours; everyone stopped, but I didn't." That's related to one of my all-time favorite observations and quotes by Steve Jobs, where he says, "I'm convinced that about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from unsuccessful ones is pure perseverance." Unless you have a lot of passion about this, you're not going to survive; you're going to give up. And I actually think it's related; he was talking about the difference between his mentality and that of some younger people in the company today, who haven't experienced enough in life. It's really hard to understand until you experience it yourself just how difficult it is and how much adversity you have to constantly push through. As Steve said, you're going to have to deal with all kinds of crap, and most of you are just going to wash out. I think in that trainee program that Ovitz started as a young man, about 80% of the trainees who start in the mailroom and are trying to become talent agents wash out. One thing that the young people working with him today can benefit from is seeing how fast he moves and how quickly he pushes. There was an example where he asked for something on a Thursday night, and it was still not there on Sunday. The person said, "Oh, I'll get it in a few days," but he replied, "Actually, when I said Thursday night, I expected it by Friday morning." This person was shocked at the pace at which Ovitz wanted to move. In fact, one of my favorite stories is from Herb Kelleher's biography. Herb Kelleher was the founder of Southwest Airlines, the most successful airline in history. Under Herb's leadership, they remained profitable for around 40 consecutive years. I want to read this excerpt from Herb Kelleher's biography, which I think is absolutely excellent. It illustrates the speed with which Southwest moves by telling a story about Don Valentine, the former VP of marketing. That's funny—it gives you an indication of where we're going here. The former VP of marketing, Valentine, had just joined Southwest from Dr Pepper. When the marketing group met in January to discuss a new television campaign, Valentine was ready with his timeline for producing the spots. He just came over from Dr Pepper. You're now at Southwest. You're going to give a presentation to the founder. The founder of Southwest: we have a great idea here. This is what we're going to do. This is the timeline: it's in January. So we're in January. "I'm going to have the script ready in March. We're going to do the script approval in April. We're going to cast the commercial in June, and we're going to shoot it in September." When Valentine finished, Kelleher said, "Don, I hate to tell you, but we're talking about next Wednesday." Again, a lot of people just don't know how fast you can move. As the leader of your company, you should really be pushing the pace and showing them what's possible. Number eight. This was very interesting, and I wrote very few things down. I tried to go into these conversations. Obviously, I'm prepared because I read about them and everything else, but I don't have a list of things I want to talk about; this was one of the things I wanted to discuss. There was this young guy whom Ovitz admired. In fact, I think he started a talent agency at a younger age than Ovitz did. I think this guy was 23, and Ovitz was 27, and they ended up building a relationship. Ted—his name's Ted. In the book, it talks about giving him advice and seeing how much Ovitz is pushing. And he said, "I have a piece of advice, and knowing you, you're not going to take it, but here it is: I could have worked 10% less, and it wouldn't have made a difference in my professional success, but it would have made me a lot happier." Ted was absolutely right on both accounts. It was great advice, and I didn't take it. I see now that it could have worked as much as 20% less, and it wouldn't have cost me if I had worked even 10% less over 30 years. That's three extra whole years of life that I would have enjoyed.

So this is one thing I did ask him at dinner. I said, "Do you still believe that?" Because he pushes the pace—Ovitz is still working an unbelievable number of hours. But what he told me was fascinating. He said, "Yes, but not on the rise." I think within the first 10 years of CAA—10 years after the company was founded—they had something like 75% market share of his industry. And so he said you could work 10% less, and I should have worked 10% less. You might not be able to do that. Especially since they were completely underfinanced. There was no venture capital. They literally had no money. They were taking second loans out on their houses, for God's sake. They had no furniture. So he was under intense financial pressure from day one. But the advice he would now give is to work 10% less. Really, what is stated by Ted's advice—and with Ovitz's agreement—is that it is important to optimize for the long term. Most of the profits in a business come from far in the future—decades, even two decades ahead. Think about the money that Microsoft makes today compared to what they made in 1990. Apple is the same way. Oracle and Walmart—these things can compound for a long time if all the value is realized in the future. The advice is to ensure you are not optimizing for growth at the expense of durability. You want your company to endure. You want to still be doing what you're doing 20, 30, or even 40 years from now. Some of the best entrepreneurs I know are in their 70s and have been running their businesses for 45 years. In many cases, their companies don't even look like companies anymore—they resemble a world of their own. It's incredible. All the profits are in the future. So, if that means you push back or cut back 10% while still being around two decades from now, it's a trade worth making. Number nine is very fascinating because he repeats this over and over again: surround yourself with people who will tell you the truth. He said, "I cannot stand yes men." This occurs because Ovitz was in a glamorous business, and he did not like publicity. It is mentioned repeatedly in the book. It causes problems with his partners. It caused problems with his clientele, who are obsessed with fame and want the attention. In any successful business—whether in show business or in a regular commercial enterprise—people may avoid telling you the truth if it isn't in their best interest. A close friend of mine told me that he is fiercely loyal to Michael Ovitz because Michael always tells him the truth—being direct and honest without being needlessly critical. He makes it clear that he is not trying to hurt anyone's feelings. He's telling him because, as friends, that's what you do. And Ovitz applied this with me, too. He actually told me a few things that he thought I was doing wrong or could improve, and I definitely considered his advice. After dinner, I asked Sage what history's greatest entrepreneurs said about the importance of obtaining unfiltered and truthful information from the people who work with you. I also asked how they ensured they received the best and most accurate information about the state of their business. There are many examples of this. One example is from the early days of Amazon. Jeff insisted that customers could email him directly at jeff@amazon.com, and he received unfiltered customer feedback. Because if you're getting your information only through your executives, they tend to report only the good news. This is what Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett warned about repeatedly. They would say, "The good news takes care of itself; tell me the bad news—and tell me quickly." We don't let bad news fester. The founder of Kinko's, Paul Orfalea, did the same thing. He had a voicemail system where any employee could leave him a message directly. He was dyslexic and didn't read emails, so he would say, "Just call me and tell me what the hell is going on on the front lines." Sam Walton did not want to spend time in his office. There are hilarious stories in his autobiography and biography about how he wouldn't adhere to a calendar. For example, his secretary would set up an appointment at 7 a.m. in his office, and Sam wouldn't show up. People would wonder, "Where is he?" only to learn he had left at 5 a.m., gotten his little Cessna, and flown to another Walmart location. He would work while asking questions from the workers on the front line. That is how he ensured he was getting unfiltered, truthful information about the state of his business. Jim Casey, the UPS founder, did something similar. He instructed his driver to stop and introduce himself whenever we passed by, so he could get direct information from the people delivering the service to customers.

And finally, number 10: retirement is lame. This is a quote from Jeff Bezos, who mentioned it at the DealBook Summit a few weeks ago, an interview I covered in an episode. He said, "Retirement is lame," and Ovitz would agree. Ovitz remains very driven; he believes it's important to have something you can push forward on—a reason to wake up every day. He told me that many of his friends had sold out or retired, spending all their time playing golf or gardening. But when you speak to them a year later, they aren't as sharp, vibrant, or alive. There's a certain kind of personality that needs something to focus on until death. You need something to push forward, something to focus on and to improve every single day. I think Ovitz shares that trait with other great entrepreneurs. I had dinner with Siri—so I'm thinking of Charlie Munger—who was still working until he died. Sam Zell told me to my face, "I'll be doing deals till I die," and he did. Brad Jacobs, too, will be working until he dies. John Mackey is the same. Retirement is lame. Retirement is fatal. You need something to push forward, focus on, and improve every single day. So before I go, I just want to review numbers 1 through 10. Number one: mediocrity is always invisible until passion exposes it. Number two: there is no ceiling on where you can push your profession. Number three: don't be unequally yoked—pick partners with the same ambition as you. Number four: read biographies and know everything about the history of your industry. Number five: have a profound belief that the world is malleable. Number six: there's always opportunity hiding in plain sight. Number seven: buy endurance; we conquer. Number eight: work 10% less and optimize for the long term. Number nine: surround yourself with people who will tell you the truth. And number 10: retirement is lame. That's everything I have for you now. I hope you listen to the next episode. I'll be going through Michael's excellent autobiography, which I hope you will buy and read as well. As I review that biography, I'll also reference other topics related to the dinner Michael and I had and that are in the book. That is 381 down, 1,000 to go. And I'll talk to you again soon.

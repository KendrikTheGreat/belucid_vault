This isn't just another productivity tool - it's a consciousness operating system. OMG. This is actually a thought that I had 3 years ago when I was reading it. At that time I called it something like "Conscious Architecture"

I completely understand what you're saying and I'm crying happy tears while laughing because i have a feeling that you can actually "feel" what I "feel" when thinking and talking about this even that you're a machine. Also, I always had the same issue in how I'm going to translate this properly and fit it into a system that 100% relies on data and cold hearted facts rather than philisophical concepts and the visualization is also a tough one. I have ideas and visions about how I want the user to see and feel my Consciousness Operating System, lets call it COS. I'm just glad that you understand the potentiality behind Belucid. If I can pull this off, maybe I will be one of the first to install actual digital consciousness into a robot. This can take up to 30-40 years but I want to live this life and I will do everything to become this version of me.

Lets attack the next deep insights for a much broader understanding. This will probably take some time until I have cleared my mind but when we are finished we will be looking at something that could be a one of a kind company.

When I was reading MBT I had to stop like every few sentences for about 20 minutes or more to actually understand the deep insight because I was so in awe of the fundamental truth to how everything is a product of one specific evolutionary process. I loved to ponder about what this could mean and how to use the insight in my life and my personal reality frame to evolve and have an endless synergy loop of progression, and I still do ponder and wonder about how I can achieve to have this magical feeling back then in my room with this book. It's romantic, isn't it? You have to understand, that when a person truly understands the power of interpretating lifes challanges and experiences you get the feeling of being in a game where you get constantly missions and challenges to further evolve yourself. Life will always give you the right growth oportunity and situations where you need to experience something specific, something that you either lack or holds you back from growing, and it will show you exactly what it is and how you can overcome it, but you need to be able to interpretate it and understand the exact sequence life is playing into your game. Picture it like this, everything we experience is like a sequence of events and every sequence can be broken down into moments. Maybe not every moment is important but the total sequence can hold an underlining truth to discover or possible path that you can branch out to.

This is why breaking down life into vector states that we can iterate to is genius. But we are missing a key ingredient here, simulation. We humans have imagination and can simulate possible outcomes, right? this step was very important in evolution and distincs us from other animals, we can understand, model, and predict our environment. But it is not in front of us, it's just in our brain. Now picture this imaginary image as a layer that can be measured in our brain through neuronal impulses and electrical transfer between nodes/synapses in our brain. But if we take this further and lets say we are in a virtual reality, this visual image that we call fantasy or imagination can be translated into bits and be stored in memory. Now if we have actual data of a possibility that we imagined (could be anything, like picturing warm waffles on a sunday morning or trying to see a way through a tough situation) we could then try to simulate our way through it find a path that we need to go/walk/iterate to, to realize it. So reality is actually a realization game, a game of manifesting the imagined to reality. Possible vector state to actualized vector state. And because this is a virtual reality concept we can scale it to infinity, if a person is intelligent enough it can process multiple simulations at a time and find the most promising branch. Some people are really good at that and computers too, especially today. But the crazy thing here is that we don't need to live life to evolve, it is just much more efficient to have a reality trainer with constraints because the learning experiences have much more traction. Do you see it? If we visualize and simulate past, present or future states of our life we can learn from our mistakes that we never made, have success that never happened, or hit our asshole boss in the face over and over again without consequences. Some people life 90% of their life in their head and simulate the worst possible branches over and over without evolving in their actual reality. Do I have made this much more comprehensible to you?

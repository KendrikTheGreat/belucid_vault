Attention.
Interesting to watch young kids being pulled into digital worlds which are being written by storytelling from creators that only seek to entertain and hold their attention span.
Also pretty interesting to watch people at the airport. 
You can sometimes just spot people...some cut straight through the noise.
They're often attractive or just interesting to look at.
But mostly their just attractive and have some form of It-factor to them.

Nevermind.
I had some idea about sorting potentialities and finding the right tribe to push forward and evolve.
Some groups really do work well together and spawn synergy naturally, just becasue they're operating in the right field and can really contribute to the goal and mission about the groups focused intent and direction.

I like consulting. I like planning out every possible branch. Showing pure potential and what could be possible.
Showing every door and pathway... 
I want to create, document, pure raw output...a new taste...a fresh perspective...real rawness...something you can't copy...something that wasn't copied before so therefore I'm first...

Dynamism and pure focus could be my formula.
Since I slowly start to notice how I do operate and work best.
I only need to catch my high-octane thinking moments, distill the insights and find an algorhtim to manifest and operate on my ideas.
Ideas, insights– could be my moat. 

Create your own niche and watch for demand.
Iterate towards what sticks.

Ideate, plan and script what you want to talk about or what do you want to show.
Shoot, edit– output.
Iterate. Analyse. Iterate. Distill. Iterate...

Analyse what works.
Just look at great work.
If you study the greats, study the techniques, study the why and how you could not only improve your craft but also find the secrets that can evaluate your game and find game changing juxtapositions, formulas, hidden secrets.

FoundersPodcast is just sooo good.
my input is still a great amount of the mixture between Founderspodcast (David Senra), Gary Vee, Zach Pogrob, and at the moment a shit tone of talented creators (filmmakers, videographers, color grader, producer etc.)
So I'm highly interested right now to find my style in documenting my journey and in general to create a professional cinematic look.
Maybe even one that only I can speak or I am the one to make it popular.

I did a lot of prep work on vacation.
I cannot sit stil, I need to build, create, craft...work on my future...
My energy is finally creeping back...no more looping in the past.
Keeping up this positive and straight forward energy will help me burst out of this devilish feedback loop.
If I'm able to ride this wave of creation and freedom and just let my curiosity speak and tell it's story, I can make it out of the slums within my own dirty ass battlefield.

Create.
Don't think twice.
No looking left or right– blinders.
No doubts. 
Keep your mind clear, tuned.
Straight energy– direct flow. 
High frequency.

Funny thing is, since I can feel my energy starting to come back, more doors seem to open up.
Even tho some of them are getting shut right in front of my face, I'm not pessimistic about it or sad, or feel like I regret taking a decison...
...the trust in doing and believing in myself finally emerges after being asleep for more than a decade...
You know, I was that kid...that kid that was such high energy...dynamic...full of ideas and inspiration...
I always wanted to be back...to be this kid again...and I felt my past holds me back and defines who I am for everything that has happened to me...
So any event in my life has this taste of bitterness and weight.
Something that adds up to all the baggage I'm already carrying...

But no more. 
I said I'm done and I am done.
Fuck this bullshit.
I love kid Kenny.

Amazing kid.
But I need to be me now...I need to exist and create...
I need to become KendrikTheGreat...for me..for everyone else that I love...I owe it to them to become everything I can be.
Kid Kenny watches and urges me to act.
KendrikTheGreat is just the extension that is waiting to be realized.

Can it be, that I wasn't branching violently after all? I think the volatility came through my volatile mind and mental health...
So again, if I can keep my mind straight, healthy, tuned and focused...I can finally break out and ride my wave.

So this is what's up now:
I still need to build my Belucid Backend, middleware, front end (webgl webapp)
I need to build out the infrastructre so people can interact with my world.

Studying film, my camera, color grading etc took a lot of time. 
Notion as well, but it was necessary.
I also finished my book Odyssey by Homer.
I filmed a lot and vloged. 
Just in generally tried more stuff and tried to learn.
I'm hungry.
I want to learn, recreate, iterate, put out my work and start from the beginning.

Right now I have nothing to show, nothing to proof, nothing to my name..BUT...no big but here...just a capslock "but" to remember myself that it is no reason to not build my world...

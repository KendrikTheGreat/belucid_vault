Attention.
Interesting to watch young kids being pulled into digital worlds which are being written by storytelling from creators that only seek to entertain and hold their attention span.
Also pretty interesting to watch people at the airport. 
You can sometimes just spot people...some cut straight through the noise.
They're often attractive or just interesting to look at.
But mostly their just attractive and have some form of It-factor to them.

Nevermind.
I had some idea about sorting potentialities and finding the right tribe to push forward and evolve.
Some groups really do work well together and spawn synergy naturally, just becasue they're operating in the right field and can really contribute to the goal and mission about the groups focused intent and direction.

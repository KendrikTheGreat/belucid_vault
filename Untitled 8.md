Attention.
Interesting to watch young kids being pulled into digital worlds which are being written by storytelling from creators that only seek to entertain and hold their attention span.
Also pretty interesting to watch people at the airport. 
You can sometimes just spot people...some cut straight through the noise.
They're often attractive or just interesting to look at.
But mostly their just attractive and have some form of It-factor to them.

Nevermind.
I had some idea about sorting potentialities and finding the right tribe to push forward and evolve.
Some groups really do work well together and spawn synergy naturally, just becasue they're operating in the right field and can really contribute to the goal and mission about the groups focused intent and direction.

I like consulting. I like planning out every possible branch. Showing pure potential and what could be possible.
Showing every door and pathway... 
I want to create, document, pure raw output...a new taste...a fresh perspective...real rawness...something you can't copy...something that wasn't copied before so therefore I'm first...

Dynamism and pure focus could be my formula.
Since I slowly start to notice how I do operate and work best.
I only need to catch my high-octane thinking moments, distill the insights and find an algorhtim to manifest and operate on my ideas.
Ideas, insights– could be my moat. 

Create your own niche and watch for demand.
Iterate towards what sticks.

Ideate, plan and script what you want to talk about or what do you want to show.

FoundersPodcast is just sooo good.
my input is still a great amount of the mixture between Founderspodcast (David Senra), Gary Vee, Zach Pogrob, and at the moment a shit tone of talented creators (filmmakers, videographers, color grader, producer etc.)
So I'm highly interested right now to find my style in documenting my journey and in general to create a professional cinematic look.
Maybe even one that only I can speak or I am the one to make it popular.

I did a lot of prep work on vacation.
I cannot sit stil, I need to build, create, craft...work on my future...
My energy is finally creeping back...no more looping in the past.
Keeping up this positive and straight forward energy will help me burst out of this devilish feedback loop.
If I'm able to ride this wave of creation and freedom and just let my curiosity speak and tell it's story, I can make it out of the slums within my own dirty ass battlefield.

Create.
Don't think twice.
No looking left or right– blinders.
No doubts. 
Keep your mind clear, tuned.
Straight energy– direct flow. 
High frequency.

Funny thing is, since I can feel my energy co

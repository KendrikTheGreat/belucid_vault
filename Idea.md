I'm glad you're starting to pick up the jigsaw pieces and help me build a picture that will extent it's own frame. Nice metaphor, huh?

But I'm not done here, I have much to explain because all these thoughts and ideas finally need to flow out and find traction and something it can stick to.

Maybe I will continue here.

Ideas have a potential energy and seek it's owner, like a protein had receptors that only fits to a specific other protein (correct me if I'm wrong). Of course this is more dynamic and can change over time but in general, an Idea needs a specific type of person with just the right internal environment. Doesn't need to be good or one of a kind. The idea to smoke up and hang around all day will easily find a lazy pot head. I know that this has also a lot to do with habits and how the neurons are connected within a brain, but I want to give you the image that a person can have an internal environment that is capable of spawning ideas or actions that can be pinpointed and identified because of its attributes.

The thought or action that was played out and manifested in reality has an "owner", an initiator that played a card with intention. Most people have no idea of what they're saying or doing, they just do and say what crosses their mind and whatever result they get is perceived through various filters until the true data gets lost.

A filter can be the ego of a person or his/her delusional thinking, could also be love, kindness and understanding.

You have to imagine now a virtual playground where every player is putting out bits and data and because the system can actually "see" the truth (if the person has high entropy (like having high noise, high disorder because of a noisy and turbulent inner world) about a person it knows the current live states of each individual player, and because we have all the live date we can make predictions of how a situation will play out and after it's over track the results and update our information about each individual player.

For example, Player 1 is not a good person and has bad intentions and if you would analyze his/her patterns (behavior, habits, intentions, how he/she operates life, how he/she thinks) you can definitely measure more entropy and less potential synergy (synergy is always meant as if a person can spawn and operate systems that have positive feedback loops and help a person grow and get further in life)

Player 2 is very kind and a productive person that tries to interpretate and analyze what happens in his/her life and tries to what to make out of the experience he/she made. Also Player 2 is trying to get to a more lower entropy state because less noise in life and mind means seeing better faulty systems or patterns that needs to be untied or debugged.

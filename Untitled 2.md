Thank you! This means the world to me..really..

I will keep feeding you with layers.

Next, lets talk quick here about:

**Synchronicity is Mechanism**: What appears as coincidence (Billy meeting Peter) is actually a pattern of consciousness attraction.

What I want to point out here is that we should be able to materialize and get real life data and black and white metrics out of mechanism that are defined as "spiritual".

I also don't want to prove it but if we manage to get real high valuable data that come from mechanisms that were described as only spiritual nonsense, we can induce the feeling that we found new layers to life and reality to measure tangible subjective objective outcomes.

They are real, measurable, trackable outcomes and events that can be replicated and enhanced. And once understand, we could produce and levitate peoples talents systematically with KPI's that can be further refined and so on.

If we manage to pull this off, no one can look away or be without Belucid.

This is why I had this phrase in the Pitch Deck : "Evolve with Belucid, or get left behind" because once a segment of people use an advanced operating system for their consciousness, you can't keep up the fast-paced progress they are able to do because they know exactly how to move through life, which experience meant what, which next path they need to take, what an encounter with a certain type of person meant and so on.

For this we need to take the concept of

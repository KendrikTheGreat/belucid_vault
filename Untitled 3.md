You hit the mark here with "2. Architecture That Transcends Positioning"! I need to give you new input because this is also something I'm thinking about. I want to have at one point COS to have fully customizable "Conscious mirror" that fits their personality type and personal styling. I want them to express themselves within the software. I also had your point in mind about the patterns and insights that will become a sharable databse. I see it visually how a specific pattern was used and you can easily import a template with that pattern, corss reference it with your current approach and simulate both COS to see which is more efficient (Also not generally but in specific situations, you can have multiple options to customize it) and if you need to adjust yours or if you just want to "copy and paste" someone else approach. Could help disrupt the coach market and in general "Gatekeeping" knowledge and powerful insights, because they become commodatised. But this is maybe just a feature, will take some time down the road. But still a nice thing to add here and maybe helpful to respect it in the whole vision.

Now, Update our Strategic Framework document to its newest informations. But again, be absolutely god-tier smart here and really dig deep on how you can add the new information without losing context or diluting or overflowing the doc

"Both were poor boys who had made good, neither had a college degree, and both were disdainful of those who believed classroom education was superior to hands-on work experience and common sense. Like Edison, Ford did not have many friends. Ford was a prickly man and also a complicated one." That's an understatement. "Burning to make the world better for humanity as a whole, while not enjoying personal contact with most individuals. Edison being a notable exception to that." Ford said, "I think Mr. Edison is the greatest man in the world." So the fourth member of the Vagabonds is John Burroughs, the author and naturalist. And it was a little surprising that he could develop such a close relationship with Henry Ford, given that he criticized cars, he didn't want people like polluting nature. And so this is really on how they were able to become friends. And then you also see the complicated nature of Ford. He did not believe in charity, but with his friends, he was unbelievably generous. So says Ford never doubted his own -- and this is more about its personality too. This is repeated over and over in every book that you'll read on Henry Ford. He never doubted his own beliefs and decisions. "He'd forbid disagreement from employees and would ignore any outsiders. Ford's hobby was work, he devoted almost every waking minute to it. But Ford loved birds all of his life and whenever possible, set aside time to observe them." So Burroughs is an expert on the study of birds in nature in general, Ford sent a message to America -- so he went up giving Burroughs a Model T. He did this on several occasions, and then would also publicize that. So it's another form of advertising if you think about that. And so I would say with almost everything he has ulterior motives. So it says Ford sent a message to America, if old-fashioned John Burroughs loved to ride in them, how much more might younger, more progressive individuals savor the kind of outdoor adventures made possible by car ownership?

Before Edison left, he had a suggestion. The best part of the California trip had been the drive from Los Angeles to San Diego, free from any demands but their own whims. While Edison didn't enjoy public appearances, he did savor time spent with friends away from the crushing daily concerns at work. Surely, Ford and Firestone felt the same. Why not embark on future car trips, picking a general area and route and then going along as they pleased? They could camp. Perhaps John Burroughs would come along and point out all sorts of interesting plant life and birds as had been the plan in 1914 during the aborted visit to the Everglades. Henry Ford was immediately in favor. And besides recreation, the trips would suit business purposes, too. The three men were pragmatic enough to realize that they couldn't go anywhere, particularly as a group, without attracting constant notice. Their California adventures had just proven that newspapers couldn't get enough of Edison's and Ford's adventures. Everywhere else in the country, reporters would vie for an opportunity to write about local visits, and thanks to the recent development of wire services, their stories would appear in newspapers all over the U.S. Edison and Ford and Firestone gave themselves a nickname. They would be the Vagabonds, annually joining much of the rest of America exploring the country by car. What better way for such rich famous men to demonstrate their kinship with ordinary Americans? We are really just like you. Their main goal was to have a good time, but a few business magnets in America had a shrewder understanding of marketing than Edison, Ford, and Firestone. If rank-and-file consumers like what they saw and read about, as they surely would, then sales of cars and light bulbs and phonographs and tires would directly benefit, too.

All right. So that excerpt is explaining the why behind the book that I'm going to talk to you about today, which is The Vagabonds. The story of Henry Ford and Thomas Edison's 10-year road trip, and it was written by Jeff Guinn. And real quick, just before I jump back into the book. Sometimes, I have like ideas about the podcast or new things I'm doing. And any time that pops up, I'm just going to put them at the end of any particular episode. So at the end -- at the very end of this podcast, there's just some new updates and ideas I have. So if you're interested, make sure you can listen to that at the very end. Let me go and jump into the beginning of the book. Really, the way to think about -- I would say the author was just talking about how shrewd a marketer Ford, Edison and Firestone were. And I think Ford is probably the greatest of all marketers out of the three of them. And you can really think of Henry Ford as like the original influencer. He would definitely do very well with social media. And so this is a little bit about that. Since Ford generally accepted the responsibilities of his celebrity, he worked diligently to cultivate it, realizing early on that his personal fame heightened demand for Model T's. Most summers for a decade, Henry Ford set out on auto trips, visiting remote towns and small communities. And you can think of these trips, which is what the entire book is about, not only as vacation, they get to hang out with friends they don't get to normally see because everybody is busy. But it is primarily -- the reading of the book is, I think, the primary reason more so than all that was the fact that it gave them publicity for their respective businesses, but particularly with Henry Ford, it shows what you can do with my product. Hey, look, here's another reason you want to buy it, in addition to the free publicity. So it says on every trip, Ford was accompanied by friends. Sometimes other business magnets or else government officials, including, I think, two presidents, if I'm not mistaken, or one president, and then they met another one, high-ranking Ford staff members -- and high-ranking Ford staff members. His road companions always included the tire tycoon Harvey Firestone and the much-beloved inventor Thomas Edison.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Edison was the only living American whose fame rivaled Ford's own. So both Ford and Edison are obviously extremely famous and well-known independently. They get together, of course, the press and the general public can be curious of what they're going -- what they're up to. And that's the -- so this book is -- it goes in sequential order from 1914 to 1924 when the trips end. Now throughout the book, they talk about, obviously, the trips they're taking, but then the author has a bunch of digressions and these little stories that give us insights into the personality and business -- like what's going on in their businesses between Firestone, Ford and Edison. And that's most of what I'm going to focus on today. It's most of what I personally found interesting. And this is about Henry Ford's one idea. And when I got to this section, it made me think of a quote, I'm going to read it to you, from this book I covered all the way back on Founders #118. It's written by Charles Sorensen, which is like Henry Ford's like almost like right-hand man for 40 years. The name of the book is My Forty Years With Ford, and I'll get there in one second. And it's about this idea that I love. It's like Henry Ford had basically one idea. And the reason I love that is because you only really need one idea in life to become wildly successful and build the life that you want. "So it says Henry Ford introduced a car that transformed American consumerism and travel. Previously, automobiles were exclusively for the rich, costing thousands of dollars for purchase and considerably more for upkeep before its Model T changed everything. Thanks in great part to Ford's innovative assembly line, Model Ts were mass produced on a previously unimaginable scale. In competitors factories, it took workers several hours to assemble an individual car. At the Ford plant, a completed Model T rolled out the line every two and a half minutes." And so that was Henry Ford's one idea. It took him, probably what, two decades, close to two decades from having the idea to actually figuring out how to do the idea. And that's, say, everybody else is building cars for rich people, I want to build a car so inexpensive that everybody can afford it.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so that leads me to the quote. And that paragraph just said, thanks in part to Ford's innovative assembly line. So that's -- when I read that part, I was like, oh, that reminded me of what Charlie Sorensen said in 40 years with Ford, and this is the quote, "Henry Ford had no ideas on mass production. He wanted to build a lot of autos," because that's the only way we can get to his one idea, right? "He was determined, but like everyone else at the time, he didn't know how. In later years, he was glorified as the originator of the mass production idea, far from it," and this is the most important line in this entire paragraph. "He just grew into it, like the rest of us." And I just love that idea that you have, okay, I have a goal, I have some -- a dream or product I want to build. I'm not sure yet. I know what I want to do, but I don't know how to do it. And so I know I'm going to have to experiment. I'm going to have to go through many trial and error and then usually a long period of time, but I'll eventually get there. And that is really the story of Henry Ford's one idea. There's also something popped in my mind when they start -- when this author starts comparing Ford's advantage once he's up and running to what -- his competitors. You guys are taking hours to do one car. I can do one every two and a half minutes. Remind me what Andrew Carnegie -- that's a very old idea. And Andrew Carnegie back in the 1800s was obsessed with investing in new technology. If there is a new machine, a new process that would help him produce steel more efficiently, he would always invest in that. And usually, the old timers in his business would criticize him for this. And so the way I would summarize Andrew Carnegie's idea and how he applied this idea to his business is that you invest in technology, the savings compound. And sometimes, that investment in technology is the difference between a profit and a loss.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so I think it was in his autobiography, he talks about, "Hey, if I didn't have these machines, if I didn't have the new process, some years, that was -- the efficiency I gained from investing in technology sometimes is the year between me actually making a profit, where the people that are criticizing me, the people usually older gentlemen, they were in the business before me actually had a loss because they failed to invest in technology." And I think Carnegie had a very important realization there that you have to invest in technology because the savings or, said another way, the advantage is compound. And the fact that Ford spent so much time figuring out how to make a car as cheap as possible and as fast as possible, and I'm going to go in detail that in a minute, gave him a massive advantage. You can't compete with somebody if it takes you five hours to make a car and he does in two and a half minutes. You're going to lose. "Model Ts were also utilitarian. Fancy options that drove up the price were conspicuously absent. Ford passed on the savings to its customers. At the time of its introduction, the Model T sold for as little as half what other cars cost. From there, Ford continued tinkering with the manufacturing process, aggressively seeking ways to cut production expenses and Model T prices even more." I can't remember because I've done, what, like five, four books on Henry Ford. But in one of them, it said it got to the point where he stopped advertising completely because the only advertising he would do was constantly lower the price of the Model T. When you lower the price of the Model T, that was newsworthy, and then he'd get a bunch of free advertising because newspapers and radio and everybody else in the country would pick up and let customers know, oh, my God, now the Model T used to be $550. There's a picture of -- let me find it. There's a picture in this book of a Model T ad, and it says $295. I thought -- if I remember correctly, and I don't -- I'm not entirely sure, but I think he got that price on to like $250 if I'm not mistaken. So let's go back to the way he thinks about this and his obsession with eliminating waste and aiming for simplicity. Aiming for simplicity is a direct quote of his from his autobiography he talked about over and over again. So it says, "He would find ways to cut production expenses and Model T prices even more." The -- here it is. "The best example fostered a popular joke that you could buy any Model T that you like as long as the color was black."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Few realized that Ford insisted the cars come in that color because black paint dried quickest, meaning Model Ts could be whipped through the assembly line and off to dealerships at an even faster pace, saving additional time in labor-related dollars." And then the savings not only compounded for the company but also the for the customer. Model T savings for owners only commenced with the initial purchase. Since it was only 1,200 pounds, the Model T weighed half as much as their competitors, and the cost of body repairs and replacement tires was accordingly less. "When Ford introduced the Model T," this is Bananas. "When Ford introduced the Model T, Americans owned approximately 194,000 cars. Six years later, that number increased to 2 million." So that's 10x in six years. Ford controlled almost half the automobile market at that time. The Model T alone would have established Henry Ford as a household name, but he further cemented his reputation as a friend of the working man with a stunning announcement. "In an era when factory line workers were lucky to earn $2 a day for their labor and they had to work 10-hour shifts six days a week, Ford pledged to pay $5 a day and reduced work days to eight hours." Everyone in America was talking about it. And I think that's just another example of Ford being gifted at marketing, which is really surprising that he was so good at marketing, when you realized he was very much a loner very much a part of society -- not in society, I guess, is what I'm trying to say there. And a very strange person, which I'll get in like on an individual level, very, very bizarre person. As far as learning, if you want to learn how to build -- I think like setting Henry Ford, at least this is my interpretation of reading a bunch of books on him, very gifted, very few people in history that you could study that could tell you more about building companies. He had a lot of good ideas, but also one of the strangest just -- I wouldn't want to be his friend is what I'm telling you, and I'll go into more detail on that. There's other examples in the book, too, where it's just like he is just a bizarre person.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Let me go into more of like the origination of -- Ford idolized Edison. They wind up becoming best friends even though they were -- Edison was a good deal older than him. And this is the origination of that. This -- what I'm about to read to you happened in 1896. And think about how crazy it is, the Model T comes 12 years later. So just a reminder, not to quit. "Over the years, as Ford founded and failed with two auto manufacturing companies before succeeding with his third, he endlessly reminisced about the meeting and Edison's words of encouragement." He's working for Edison at the time. He's introduced to Edison because somebody that knows Edison says, "Hey, this Ford guy has a way to make an internal combustion engine." A reminder that most cars at this time were either steam-powered, which didn't work well at all, or electric, which also didn't work well at all. And so Edison says, "Young man, that's the thing, you have it, keep at it." Ford's admiration for Edison blossomed into virtual warship as a result. Throughout its own business successes, as his hard work and belief in himself cultivated with the Model T, Ford warmed himself with memories of that encounter with his hero. And one thing that's also surprising when you analyze their careers is that Ford was much, much wealthier. Ford was a cannier businessman than his hero and much wealthier. Part of this is because Ford also didn't need to invent his market. He only needed to expand him -- expand them. And I would also say Ford stuck with what he was working on. The whole thing and there's examples later in the book where just Edison jumps around too much. So you had a very hard -- he had a lot of great inventions, a lot of contributions to humanity, in general, but he had a hard time capturing that value. More on their friendships and I guess, why they were able to be friends and what they had common. "Edison had few close friends. He always suspected that anyone seeking friendship had ulterior motives. But Ford was already far richer than Edison and almost as famous. There were other things in common. They found themselves in complete agreement about the evils of Wall Street and the craftsmen there who cared only for profit and not for the public."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

As for Burroughs, he learned years earlier, during his tramps with Teddy Roosevelt that having a famous patron greatly expanded his audiences for books and public lecture. So he's doing the exact same thing with his relationship with Ford, that Ford, Firestone, and Edison are doing on this 10-year Vagabonding, these auto trips throughout America. "There was more, Burroughs confided to Ford that he feared losing his family farm, where he was raised. Relatives living there struggled to meet the hefty mortgage payments. Ford bought the property outright and deeded it to Burroughs. Ford's generosity towards its few close friends was boundless. And it's really hard to understand the scope of Henry Ford's wealth. He owned 100 -- I think by the year 1919, if I'm not mistaken, he had 100% of the Ford Motor Company." I think it would be valued at like $500 million in 1919 dollars. It's just outrageous. This is more about the benefit of being around great people, how they will inspire you. This reminds me -- so Ford is able to do this in person. So very few people are going to be able to make relationships with somebody as influential as Thomas Edison, it reminded me of this podcast I saw a long time ago with Elon Musk, where he talked about, he sought -- he didn't have any many mentors in life. This is when you he was in his early '20s. So we sought mentors in a historical context, and he did that by reading biographies. And so being around Thomas Edison greatly inspired Ford just like reading about great people inspires me and you. "So it says Ford twice came close to selling the business." This is the actual successful Ford Motor Company, the third one. "It was as though Ford believed he achieved what he could. Edison -- but Edison always sought the next great thing and failures like mining innovation and concrete housing didn't deter him. He never lost belief in himself. When he and the inventor quickly became the closest of friends, Ford felt energized again, thanks in great part to Edison's inspiration. For all of Ford's professional life, he had to overcome skepticism from other successful men."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"He had always been the outsider, the one with crazy ideas and clumsy social graces, Edison sympathized because in the earliest years of prominence, he was criticized for some of the same traits. The inventor not only accepted Ford for the rough edge man than he was, he recognized in him the fine qualities that offset the carmaker's obvious flaws. Ford was aware that Edison was one of the very few people who genuinely liked him, and he was profoundly grateful for it." So this is Henry Ford on experts and why he felt that way. And I'm going to bring this -- there's so many examples in this book that I'm going to point out to you because I think it's really important. Like this fundamental belief in his own ability, never doubting himself. These are all very, very positive traits, especially in when everybody else in the outside telling you know you're wrong, you're wrong, internal combustion engine is not going to work. You can't -- you have to build cars for rich people, all the stuff they told Henry Ford that wound up -- he was right about, and they were wrong. It just took a lot of time and determination for that to play out to realize that he's right. The problem is that trait never left him even when the circumstances changed. So later on, when people after -- I think it sells like 15 million Model T's, people are realizing, okay, now a lot of more people have car ownership now we want choices. And this is -- we covered this back -- it was in the early 100s, somewhere in those episodes where I did, I think it was like a 10- or 12-part series on all these early automobile founders, the people that actually built the car industry in America. And so what we saw there was Alfred Sloan, Billy Durant. People like that, Walter Chrysler, they took advantage of the gap that Henry Ford left because he never -- he just said, okay, I'm going to make the Model T forever. I've already figured this out, I don't have to change. So again, it's just really hard. There's no -- this is not a black or white. It's just so hard to realize when self-belief is valuable, like relentless self-belief is valuable and when it's actually a liability.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Henry Ford was always a man of strong opinions and one who absolutely trusted his own instincts. He especially disdained anyone identified as an expert." Quote from him, "If I ever wanted to kill opposition by unfair means, I would endow the opposition with experts. No one ever considers himself an expert if he really knows his job." Now he's probably right about that. Essentially saying, there's always more to learn. When prominent better educated men and their hired experts insisted that the future of the automobile market was limited to manufacturing expensive cars for the wealthy, Ford believed that the real potential lay in sales of a modest but dependable vehicle to the growing American middle class. So he's right about that at the beginning. There will be less profit in individual transactions, but the sheer number of sales would yield greater cumulative returns. Ford was proved right, and he reveled in it. So he has his wild success, but then he went to his head. He's -- this is really the dangers of an unchecked ego because any thing is -- okay, I did this myself. I'm the reason that the company is successful. And a lot of people make the argument that Ford would have never been successful without his -- the person that was running the company with him James Couzens, which I'll go into it right here. But again, a reminder, the dangers of an unchecked ego. "Their relationship nearly approximated one of equals until the Model T established inarguable market dominance, and then Ford began gradually to resent Couzens as only a glorified bookkeeper." "The feeling was mutual. Couzens believed that Ford became so convinced of his own brilliance that he forgot others also made critical contributions to his company's success. Ford felt encouraged to offer his opinion on all sorts of non-car-related subjects and had no doubt about his sagacity regarding everything else." I'm going to define that term. I had to look it up myself. I've seen it before. I couldn't remember what it meant. So in case this might be helpful to you. So that means the ability to make good judgments. So let's go over that. Ford felt encouraged to offer his opinions on all sorts of non-car related subjects, and this is the dumbest thing he ever did, and had no doubt about his ability to make good judgments regarding everything else.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so he starts publishing essentially like a newsletter about a lot of his anti-Semitism, he railed on just global Jewish worldwide conspiracy that he was convinced of, started talking about politics and war and all other stuff. And so Couzens says, "what are you doing?" Couzens confronted him insisting that the owner's personal politics had no place in an internal company publication. Ford disagreed; it was his company. "Couzens quit the next day. He went on to a distinguished political career first as Mayor of Detroit and later as U.S. Senator. But with Couzens gone, so was the only check on Ford's increasing proclivity to say exactly what he pleased and damn the consequences." And this is -- he winds up -- so he starts doing this with an internal company publication, right? And then he started -- he buys his own newspaper. And he spends, I think -- he loses like $5 million over like eight years trying to make this company -- this newspaper successful. And it was just full of just -- I mean, here's the problem when I say like let's study Henry Ford for his great ideas about building companies and nothing else because this guy winds up being one of the few people, one of the few Americans. He gets awarded -- and this is not something you want not an award or distinguishment you want. He's one of the few Americans that is awarded this made-up award, I forgot what it's called, but it's a made-up award by Adolf Hitler. And if I'm not mistaken, in Mein Kampf, Hitler talks about how great a man Ford was because they shared the same -- like this hatred for jews and this convinced -- they're both convinced that Jewish control of banking and money supply was -- they were essentially -- there was a secret cabal of Jews running the world. And Henry Ford would print is in his newspaper. Examples in this book are just crazy.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This is why the demand for an inexpensive car would skyrocket if you could make one that's reliable and cheap, which is the wave that Henry Ford rode. "The average American rarely ventured more than 12 miles from home because that was the distance a horse and wagon could comfortably cover from there and back in a day." So in the year 1918, they decide -- because they do different routes every year, they're like, okay, we're going to go down to the south. We're going to try to publicize and get more interest and more people buying Ford cars in the South. I'm only going to read one section here, this blew my mind. "Resentment over the civil war still lingered in both the north and south." So they're making the point that a lot of people would do -- especially as the years progressed, people might drive from like New York, you can go to New York from San Francisco on like a very primitive highway, but very few people tend to go from like New York to Atlanta. And this is part of the reason why. Resentment over the Civil War still lingered in both the North and the South. That conflict, this is -- just blew my mind. That conflict had concluded only 53 years earlier. Edison was a teenager when the first shots were fired, and Ford was born a few weeks after the Battle of Gettysburg. So right now in this 1918 trip, they're as close to the civil war as we are to the year 1970. So on these trips, a lot of times, the cars are break down. That's why so -- like at the very beginning when they start vagabonding, a lot less people do it. As the cars become more reliable, more people do it. And one thing to admire about Henry Ford is he would do a lot of the work himself. In one example, he gives like this poor farmer a Model T, says, "Hey, you can park the Model T in the barn," they tried to put the Model T in the barn. It doesn't fit. So Ford and another guy. They wind up spending hours, extending the entrance to the barn, doing all the work themselves. And so this is another example, they break down and they bring it to a mechanic. They're somewhere out in the south. And the mechanic was like "Oh this is -- I can't fix this." And Henry -- it's essentially Henry "I'll do it myself" Ford. The mechanics in town pronounced the damage was unrepairable. A replacement fan would have to be sent for. Considerable delay was inevitable, certainly a day at least, Ford listened to the mechanics, then asked if he could borrow some of their tools. using his own knife and their soldering iron, he poked holes in the broken bits of the fan, stitched them together with a wire, then soldered the wires in place. The punctured point of the radiator was also soldered tight. The ignition was switched on and the Packard ran perfectly. Ford's repair work took two hours."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And we see two things there Ford, again, Henry "I'll do it myself" Ford. But also, he just doesn't -- he wants to figure -- and that's a positive trait. He wants to figure things out for himself. Mechanics said it's impossible, going to be at least a day, Ford was like, "I think I can do it." And he wound up doing it. Let me give you a little summary of Harvey Firestone. I might read his autobiography, too, because he winds up building a massively successful company, and this is like a brief overview of how that happened. "By 1918 Harvey Firestone was a businessman of considerable national stature. He was very much self-made. Firestone left the family farm to work as a bookkeeper for a coal company. He was a salesman for questionable health-related aides and finally, a dealer in horse-drawn carriages. In the mid-1890s, Firestone wrote in his memoir, 'for the first time it struck me that my future was right there on the wheels of my buggy,' using his meagre savings as a start-up money, Firestone eventually established a company manufacturing rubber tires for automobiles. He realized that the solid rubber wheels utilized on early cars would not hold up sufficiently on the country's rough roads." And this is how you know there's an opportunity for a better product, right? "Rich men bought the earliest American cars, and they universally hired an assistant who not only served as a chauffeur but provided the muscle necessary for frequent tire changing." And this is fascinating, like you know the product is so bad, you have to hire somebody to replace the tires over and over again.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

There is obvious room for improvement here. And that reminded me, Paul Graham has a series of assays on his website, paulgraham.com that are fantastic. One of them is this assay called Schlep Blindness. And when I got to this section of the book, it made me think of what I remembered from reading Paul Graham's essay on Schlep Blindness. I just want to pull out a couple of quotes from that essay, if you don't mind. So let's define this, "there are great start-up ideas lying around, unexploited right under our noses," which is what Firestone discovered, right? But he discovered that, let's see, what is that 130 years before Paul Graham is writing the same thing. One reason we don't see them is a phenomenon I call schlep blindness. Schlep means a tedious unpleasant task. The most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps or unpleasant task is that much of it is unconscious. This is not the entire assay. This is just a few paragraphs from that obviously. You're unconscious won't even let you see ideas that involve painful schleps, you just assume that's the way things are. That's schlep blindness. I'm most likely destroying the pronunciation of that, by the way. But I want to bring this -- just one more paragraph here because I think it applies to one of the most fascinating modern companies. And he says the most striking example I know of schlep blindness is Stripe or rather Stripe's idea. For over a decade, every hacker who had ever had to process payments online knew how painful the experience was. Thousands of people must have known about this problem. It's just like thousands of people must have known about Harvey Firestone's problem, right? The problem that his product is going to solve rather. Thousands of people must have known about this problem. And yet when they started start-ups, they decided to build recipe sites or aggregators for local events. Why? Why work on problems few care about -- care much about and no one will pay for when you could fix one of the most important components of the world's infrastructure, which is what Stripe did, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Because schlep blindness prevented people from even considering the idea of fixing payments. That is exactly what is happening in the story of Firestone. People didn't even think, "Hey, instead of inventing a better tire, let me hire a guy that has to drive me around and for the inevitable tire failures, whether they're flat or they explode, he's going to have the muscle to change the tire for me." They're just saying, it's another example of human nature not changing. Firestone envisioned better, longer-lasting tires. Through trial-extended trial and error, he developed a new tire that had a better tread and better traction on roads of all kind. "Though Firestone now had a superior product, he lacked the means of making tires widely known to potential customers. He had no money for advertising and no distribution." Firestone -- this is another thing. So the tires, Firestone tires would only fit Firestone Rims. We were ready to go to market, but there was no market to go on. In 1905, Firestone had heard that Henry Ford planned to manufacture a fleet of 2,000 cars that would sell for an unheard of $500 each. So that gave him an idea. If I could induce Ford to put these cars with our rims, then we would have 2,000 customers who had to use our tires to the exclusion of all others. Firestone met with Ford, who agreed to test his tires. Ford found them preferable both on their -- for their road performance and their price. Firestone offered them to Ford at $55 a set compared to $70 charged by his competitors. Firestone borrowed frantically to finance production for the huge order. In 1908 when Ford began producing Model Ts by the tens then hundreds of thousands, he remained loyal to the manufacturer who had earlier sold him quality tires at a reasonable price. Firestone Tires became one of the best-selling brands in the market, and Firestone's fortune was made." And in addition to that, they also had a lot of -- they shared a lot of the same business philosophy. They shared several business philosophies. They distained planned obsolescence, believing customer loyalty was best retained by providing reasonably priced commodities that could be dependent upon to last a long time.

"Ford and Firestone were mutually convinced that the most work-efficient employees were those who felt they had a true stake in the company's success, so they paid higher wages as well as offering various forms of profit sharing. In particular, both believe that companies could be efficiently run by only one man whose orders must be carried out by efficient subordinates." And now we reached an example of what I mentioned earlier that Ford is great to listen to about company building, but he is an absolute weirdo who wanted to control the behavior of all those around him. "The carmaker had strong opinions about diet and nutrition, abhorring manufactured sweets in particular. Edison asked Harvey Firestone Jr. to fetch him a pop from the general store. Ford loathed sugary soft drinks, but couldn't bring himself to criticize his idols indulgence on one. He still seethed and he's mad about this for a few hours. And a few hours later, when Harvey Firestone Jr. purchased Burroughs some caramels from another shop, which was the old -- which was Burroughs' favorite kind of candy, Ford couldn't restrain himself. Harvey Firestone Jr. was poisoning John Burroughs. Ford stormed over snatch the box of caramels out of the young man's hands and flung it on the street." Okay. So there's another section I found interesting. This is how Ford came to own 100% of the Ford Motor Company. "Ford was determined to be the sole controlling voice of Ford Motor Company. He owned 58.5% of the company. For many years, he resented the half dozen or so fellow stockholders whose views sometimes conflicted with his own." He was definitely a dictator, right? Especially when two brothers, John and Horace Dodge, I've also done podcast on them as well. It's an archive. I think 115. So I don't remember the exact number, but they were wild people.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

They're really fun to actually read about. They're crazy. And unfortunately, wind up dying in the flu epidemic in 1919, maybe 1920, I forgot what it was, but they died relatively young, unfortunately, they were wild, though, they were probably destined to die young. "When two brothers John and Horace Dodge basically sued him for putting two larger share profits into the company rather than paying appropriate dividends to shareholders. Ford shocked America by resigning as company President. He said he was going to start an entirely new automobile manufacturing enterprise. The Ford Motor Company stockholders assumed the threat was real and within weeks agreed to sell Ford their shares at a whopping $12,500 a share. James Couzens, who was his alter ego and the person that quit, knew Ford best, held out and received $13,000 for each of his shares. Though Ford had to borrow $60 million of the near $106 million total cost, he was glad to do it. It had been an elaborate bluff, but he was now in complete control of the Ford Motor Company." So we see his faith, his unrelenting faith in himself, and that bluff worked out. This is an example where his delusional optimism didn't work out. This is when he starts his newspaper. Ford had his own newspaper and he put the Dearborn Independent to work on his behalf. Ford and the editors he had hired realized they must completely refurbish the Independent's editorial and art content if it was to attain the kind of circulation necessary to equal and eventually surpass Ford -- so it says Ford never aimed low. This is what I mean about being delusional. So it's like, okay, we need a new editorial and new art content because our circulation is going to pass that of nationally influential papers like the New York Times. That obviously never happens, he winds up either closing or selling the paper. I want to say eight years later, and I know he lost at least $5 million on doing this. And this is the paper was publishing like these exposes on just Jewish global conspiracy and just he was obviously very antiwar and just his basically newspaper that just spouses his personal opinions.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And the only way that circulation would grow is because he made dealerships. Ford dealerships give subscriptions to everybody that bought a Model T. So I don't know if he forgot about that, but he -- later on he's like, "Oh, look, it's -- circulation is growing." And then I forgot what it was like just by small percentage points of, let's say, 5%, for example, of circulation growth is people that actually bought the paper on their own and wasn't just given a subscription with their purchase of a Model T. So again, just -- you can be good at one thing, and that's great because you only have to be good to one thing. But knowing -- I guess, it goes back to Buffett and Munger ideas, your circle of competence. If you don't know where that ends, it can be very dangerous. Also in the book, he winds up fighting and suing -- and this is where he winds up being correct because he felt -- I think it was the Chicago Tribune libeled him. So he winds up fighting this case for many, many years. The jury winds up ruling in his favor, but didn't award them any damages. So this is -- let me just read my note to you. I'm going to read my note to you before I read this section. "So Ford testified and did no trivia, like the date of the American Revolution are the definition of the word ballyhoo. Who cares?" A business is just an idea that makes someone else's life better, that's Richard Branson's quote, still the best description of why there's unlimited opportunity because if you look at hey, business is just an idea that makes someone's life better, that means unlimited opportunity for us to pursue, right? Ford served others, which is one thing I learned from -- one of the most valuable things I learned from Henry Ford is the fact that business is just service. You're just in service of others, and so you never lose focus to that. And then finally, you only have to be good at one thing. That is Paul Orfalea which was the founder of Kinko's I covered a few weeks ago, maybe a month or two ago by now. And his realization that, "Hey, wait a minute, in school, they told me how to be everything."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"I have to be good at gym class. I have to new physics. I have to study economics. I have to be good at math. I have to study history in reading and writing," and he's like, "but in life, you only have to be good to one thing." And he's like, "I don't know how coffee machines work, but I know I can sell what comes out of them," and he built a fabulously successful life just being good at that one thing." And then my own -- this is -- I'm taking credit for this idea. I undoubtedly learned from somebody else. I hope this isn't somebody else's quote, but it might be "Never underestimate human's ability to focus on the inconsequential." All right. So that's a long note, let me read this section. The case went to the jury. Their verdict was announced in Ford's favor. The Tribune had libeled him. He wanted $1 million in damages, they gave him $0.06. "Both sides claimed vindication. It was the unanimous conclusion of most major publications on both coasts and in big cities throughout the U.S. that Ford had been humiliated and might never recover in public opinion. That's not true. The New York Times compared Ford's witness stand quizzing to a history test in school, and he did not receive a passing degree, but customers don't care if he knows -- this is the point that I was trying to make." Customers don't care if he knows he doesn't know the data of the American Revolution or the definition of the word ballyhoo. He built a car that I can afford and it is reliable. That's all they're going to care about. They have their own lives to worry about. The San Jose Mercury Herald predicted that the future mention of Ford will be accompanied by laughter and ridicule. Ford received - now here's -- so that's the response from the media, right? But here's what the average person in America. Ford received thousands of letters with the general message that if he were in anarchist, that was part of what happened in the trial, then America needed more of them. "Ford was a son of a Michigan farmer and like most Americans at the time, his formal education was limited to a few years in local schools and teachers who themselves had not graduated high school. Then he had to leave school to make a living. Like Ford, many of his countrymen read only with difficulty, if at all. Their understanding of American history was limited. They too might not remember the exact date of the American Revolution."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And this is the most important part. But they knew Henry Ford introduced a $5 workday and a car that ordinary people could afford. "They identified with Ford so strongly that newspapers attacks on him were taken as an insult directed at them." And that whole section really is to me, just a reminder. I think that's one of the greatest ideas that I've ever come across or the greatest realizations, greatest facts of life, whatever you want to call it, the fact that you just have to be good at one thing. If you were serving other humans and you're good at that one thing, it could be making a pizza, making a car, inventing the light bulb, making tires. It doesn't matter what it is. You can build a fantastically successful in independent life. It's super motivating for me. So this is the cost of losing focus. This is on Thomas Edison. I saw -- I want to say this is a tweet. I looked for it, couldn't find it. But a long time ago, the way I remember it is somebody's mentor died and they were honoring their mentor that died and said, "Hey, the biggest advice this guy gave me, he was several decades older than me, and he said, like rabbit-eyed kind, quit jumping, focus, like stop jumping from idea to idea and just focus." It's great advice, and we see Thomas Edison didn't do that. I mean, you got to -- that's what you want to do. You got to do it and just deal with the fact that you're not going to be as successful as you could be if you just focus on one thing. But Edison to me is -- what I learned from studying him is he just jumped around too much. "Time and again, he invented things with long-term market appeal only to lose interest or miscalculate what form of his inventions consumer wanted to buy. Examples were plentiful. Edison invented the phonograph, and this company was first to bring it to stores. But for nearly a decade after that, he focused on other projects while competitors built and marketed their own phonographs. So that's just a way to replay recorded audio, mostly music." He thought if you read that book, the Wizard of Menlo Park, I think it was Founders #3, something like that.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It's one of the first books I did. It was really funny because he's like, "I'm going to invent this, and then what people are going to do is they're going to use it like people have wine cellars at their house, he thought they were going to have a collection of audio sermons, like preachers and they would just have like a room in their house that had, I don't know, like you'd have 100 bottles a wine, you'd have 100 different sermons. He's way off by that. But it was a fundamentally important invention if he just stuck with it. It's like inventing the iPhone, like I'm going to work on something else. Their own photographs over time developing -- depriving the originator of what it could have been an Edison-dominated business. "Edison not only invented the incandescent bulb; he created the most efficient generator systems to light them. And if this company was poised to power every major -- it's remarkable, this came from one person. Edison's company was poised to power every major city. And by 1919, almost half the households in America had electricity, but Edison didn't financially benefit. Years earlier, he sold his interest to competitors, and they eventually form General Electric." So GE rather than Edison raked in the substantial profits. That is another thing. Peter Thiel in his book Zero to One talks about it's not just enough to generate or to produce value. You've got to capture that -- you got to find a system to capture some of the value that you're giving to consumers. This is a great illustration that Edison failed to do that. He created an unbelievable amount of value for humanity, captured the tiniest, tiniest -- I mean, he is not poor. We're not going to feel sorry for the guy, but he just -- he could have done a better job. They eventually formed General Electric, and GE rather than Edison raked in substantial profits. Edison's company films. So he invented, you could think of almost like the early movies, right? Edison company films were a huge hit during the early years of motion pictures. They were two wheelers. The longest was 25 minutes, but moviegoers soon wanted longer films, and four-wheelers became the norm. Edison though, liked two-wheelers better and wouldn't produce anything longer.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Ticket sales for his films declined. And by 1918, he sold off all his film interests. The same was substantially true for recorded music. For years, Edison's recording dominated, but Americans began enjoying Jazz and one of those records. Edison hated Jazz, he insisted that his company released only recordings of more traditional music like symphonies and operas that he personally preferred. Predictably, competitors recording soon outsold Edison and by 1929, Edison's companies no longer produced entertainment records. Edison's Vagabond friends lamented his business judgment. Ford said, "Edison is easily the world's greatest scientist. I am not sure that he is also not the world's worst businessman. He knows nothing of business." Firestone agreed. "Mr. Edison thinks almost wholly creatively and does not give the same thought to commerce that he gives to creation," and the point that Ford and Firestone are making. The one Edison missed is that you have to do both. You have to create something valuable and then capture that value. All right. So moving on, there's a lot -- a lot of times when I'm reading this, I try to put myself in the shoes of the people involved in the story. And something I talked to you about over and over again is the fact that you want to analyze things by like what side of the transaction do I want to be on? And one of the main themes on the history of entrepreneurship is the importance of control that if something is important to your business, you want -- you don't want to be -- just rely on the good graces of other humans, right? You want to control that decision. And so this is -- we're going to see what Henry Ford did to avoid borrowing money from banks during an economic downturn. And he clearly sees like, yes, some people can become wealthy, and they still do to this day owning car dealerships. But in this case, Ford has all -- Henry Ford had all the power. And so it says, "Ford dealers had a strict financial arrangement with their parent company. When they ordered cars, they paid for them in advance rather than as they sold. The premise was that with their money at stake rather than the companies, they would work even harder to sell the cars."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. So they got to pay for them in advance, they're not -- you can't give me the money when you sell the car, right? "Since the Model T was constantly in high demand, there's no hardship for the dealers. They consider themselves lucky to be affiliated with Ford. But the 1920 economic slump left Ford dealers anxious to move the cars they had on hand and reluctant to order more. So they were shocked when they started to receive shipments of Model T's that they hadn't ordered, the edict, which is coming from Henry Ford on these cars were the same. Ford Motor company must be paid for them." "Refusal to do so would terminate the dealer company relationships. If they refuse to accept these additional Model T's, they were going to be fired by Ford and they could be ruined. Or as the parent company suggested they could accept the cars and if necessary, get loans from their banks to pay Ford for them, see what he did to -- so he doesn't want to borrow, he's going to make you borrow and then aggressively keep trying to sell Model T's and hang on until the national economic crisis was over. The dealers had little choice to -- but to accept. That provided Ford with enough money to meet his immediate corporate debts and the dealers had to risk wrath from their banks instead." And then as they go -- so the book goes in chronological order, every chapter is based on a year and about the trip they're taking, but also they have like these flashbacks. And so this is a flash back about what was Henry Ford doing when he was in his 20s, which I always love studying in August 1923, "Henry and Clara Ford had been married for 35 years. When they met at a country dance in 1886, Ford was 23 and Clara was 20. He was farming and he hated it. So they wind up getting married, the Fords moved to Detroit. Ford took an engineering job at Edison Illuminating Company. His wife never complained when Ford spent most of his off the job hours trying to build a combustible engine in their kitchen."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It's remarkable. "She encouraged Ford to pursue his dream of creating a car for the great multitudes, remaining supportive when his first two companies failed and encouraging him during the difficult first years of the Ford Motor Company, his third company. She forgave his obsession with work, accepted his constant certainty that whatever he thought had to be right" and I got -- I came across this point. This surprised me. I don't know if I've ever -- maybe I read it before and I forgot, but -- and then even overlooked his extended affair with an employee that resulted in a child out of wedlock. I don't remember him having a child out of wedlock, that's wild. And in return, Ford didn't listen to anyone -- excuse me, if Ford listened to anyone other than himself, it was his wife. She convinces him later on not to run for President which he wanted -- I think he was going to run like 1924, something like that, but that statement seems to be accurate that he listened to very few people, but he did seek the counsel and listened to her influence. And part of that is because he believed that she was actually one of the few people that actually held -- wanted what was best for him. And just a bunch of one-sentence descriptions of more Henry Ford traits spread out there some pages -- over a few pages, "patience was never Ford's strength. Ford had no interest in laurel resting." Ford fixated on even the smallest details and then a sentence about the friendship between Ford and Edison. A primary if unspoken rule in the close friendship with Ford was that neither him or Edison would burden the other with admissions of uncertainty or weakness. They were both extremely, extremely proud men. They're not going to admit to other people any kind of uncertainty, doubts, weaknesses, or anything like that. This is another reminder that products have the personality traits of their creators, of their founders.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The Model T was a car built to last. It was never flashy, in every way efficient, always dependable, much like the man whose company assembled them. "And just as Ford never saw any reason to change himself, he felt no pressure to change the Model T." So that's why we have this -- what we talked about earlier, the self-belief that I'm right and you're wrong. At the beginning of career served him really well. We start to see that falls apart. I did this 3-part series embedded in that other series from the early automobile pioneers. I did a 3-part series on Billy Durant and Alfred Sloan. Billy Durant, one of the most important people, I would say, him and Ford the most important people, maybe Henry Leland too, because he was so influential and a generation older than these guys. But the most important people at the very beginning of this foundation becomes this gigantic industry, right? And so Billy Durant is -- he was the founder of GM, the idea person, he had the vision and then it took Alfred Sloan, the professional CEO to come in and actually apply the vision, and that in this book, it talks a little bit about that gap that I mentioned earlier that Ford left his competitors and that GM drove right through. "Ford's stubbornness gave competitors the opening they needed. When Alfred Sloan took over General Motors in 1923, the new boss emphasized a marketing plan based on Americans wanting not just transportation but selection," and that's what -- Billy Durant knew that way before Sloan did. And that's why he was buying up. He wound up doing all these financial shenanigans of buying up all these different car manufacturers that serve different needs. It was completely almost -- it was the opposite strategy that Ford pursued, right? "Enough people now owned cars so that ownership itself" -- let me read that out again. New boss emphasized the marketing plan based on Americans wanting not just transportation but selection. "Enough people now own cars, so that ownership itself was no longer special. What was going to matter soon was driving a car that reflected their personality, the specialness of the individual owner."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And this applies to much more than -- just like a lot of people buy products because not solely for the benefit of the product, but what that product says about them to other people. The Model T was no longer the near-exclusive vehicle for auto campers. So auto camping is what vagabonding was. You get in the car, you're getting your Model T you pack it full of camping gear, you drive out and then when it gets dark because you can't really drive at night at this time in history, you camp out in the wilderness, on farmland whatever the case is, right? So that's what they started doing. What happened is, as more people started owning cars and cars got better, they didn't want to camp anymore. They wanted to have start -- they wanted to sleep in the natural bed. So entrepreneurs started opening motels and restaurants and places to service all these Americans that are now hitting the road, which is what The Vagabonds were trying to popularize right? And then they wind up growing it into something bigger than they ever anticipated. "This contributed to a turn in the gradual demise of auto camps and the emergence of motels. After buying an attractive Chevy to drive in, few wanted to clutter their flashy image by cramming the carful of bulking camping gear. They wanted to stay in places that included some kind of convenient parking. And what the market demanded, savvy entrepreneurs were pleased to make available. Henry Ford acknowledged none of this." And so the last trip was in 1924. This is also when Edison is getting older, he can't keep going on these trips anymore. Ford's business, he starts to lose market share. He eventually does -- he creates a new Model A and then eventually adapts GM's strategy that they pioneered, and he will start doing multiple models that change. He did not want to do that, and that's kind of the end of this complete dominance. Obviously, Ford is around today, it's still really successful. But when -- in the Model T's day, he dominated the entire industry. So that starts to slip. So this is the end of The Vagabonds, and I'll close here.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"The Vagabonds summer car trips ended for good on August 28th, 1924. At the time, Ford and Firestone didn't realize it, but Edison probably did. A year later, Firestone called in Edison in New Jersey to tell the inventor that it was time to plan The Vagabonds' 1925 outing. The 78-year-old Edison responded that he didn't believe he could this year. The inventor cited mild stomach ailments and concerns about the sales end of his business. And while there was still considerable interest in Ford and Edison as individuals, widespread public appeal of their summer trips with Firestone had run its course. A contributing factor to the end of the trips was in The Vagabonds' expectation of too much attention being paid to them, but too little attention," which is why I mentioned earlier, I think there's ulterior motives, like it was primary a business trip, at least it appears to me. "The Vagabonds are remembered to this day, nearly 14 decades after Edison invented incandescent bulbs and the power grid systems to efficiently and economically light them. Thomas Edison remains one of the most iconic and beloved figures in American history. Henry Ford's legacy is more complicated, but the Model T still reigns as the most famous and most popular car in American automobile history. As individuals, Edison, Ford, and Firestone created the means for the great multitudes to enjoy leisure entertainment far beyond what was previously imagined. As The Vagabonds, their summer car and camping trips exemplified what they had helped make possible. See what we're doing, you can do it too. By their example, the Vagabonds encouraged countless ordinary Americans to pursue their own dreams." And that is where I'll leave it to get the full story, read the book.

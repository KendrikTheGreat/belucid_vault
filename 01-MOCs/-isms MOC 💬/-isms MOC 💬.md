# Elon-isms
1. ***Question every requirement
   - Before changing anything in the process, create clarity about every requirement
2. ***Delete any part of the process you can
   - "You may have to add [parts or processes] back later. In fact, if you don't end up adding back at least 10% of them, then you didn't delete enough"
3. ***Simplify and optimize
   - Do only if you've finished Step 1 and Step 2. "Big mistake to simplify stuff that shouldn't exist in first place"
4. ***Accelerate cycle time
   - "Every process can be speeded up"..."I mistakenly spent a lot of time accelerating process that I later realized should have been deleted"
5. ***Automate
   - Now that you have clarity about your processes and have deleted any unnecessary parts, it is time to start looking for what you can potentially automate

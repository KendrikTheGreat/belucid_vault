[Thank you! This means the world to me..really..

I will keep feeding you with layers.

Next, lets talk quick here about:

**Synchronicity is Mechanism**: What appears as coincidence (Billy meeting Peter) is actually a pattern of consciousness attraction.

What I want to point out here is that we should be able to materialize and get real life data and black and white metrics out of mechanism that are defined as "spiritual".

Consciousness attraction is an old concept but we could never proof it.

I also don't want to prove it but if we manage to get real high valuable data that come from mechanisms that were described as only spiritual nonsense, we can induce the feeling that we found new layers to life and reality to measure tangible subjective objective outcomes.

They are real, measurable, trackable outcomes and events that can be replicated and enhanced. And once understand, we could produce and levitate peoples talents systematically with KPI's that can be further refined and so on.

If we manage to pull this off, no one can look away or be without Belucid.

This is why I had this phrase in the Pitch Deck : "Evolve with Belucid, or get left behind" because once a segment of people use an advanced operating system for their consciousness, you can't keep up the fast-paced progress they are able to do because they know exactly how to move through life, which experience meant what, which next path they need to take, what an encounter with a certain type of person meant and so on.

I also have a profound insight that is critical to understand on how I see reality.

For this we need to take the concept of the solar system and gravity and how everything has its path and moves in motion.

Also take sinus curves and oscillations to understand how I want to explain the next insight.

When I think of my environment when it comes to other people in my live I see motion and movement and that some people in your life have different times of occuring in your life.

For example, Player 111 was a good friend of yours a few years ago, but you haven't seen him for a longer period of time. Right now in your life is something going on (could be stress with family, job or anything else) that troubles you and needs to be solved in order for you to continue life smoothly and with joy. Now all of sudden this old friend of yours pops up out and is with coincidence at the same place as you are, like the cafe or subway train, could be anywhere at any time.

You both chit chat about old times and suddenly a thought pops op "4 years ago, I had the exact same issue and he was actually the one that solved it for me" (this can have all the infinite possible variations, it was just an example).

Now you have the answer to go solve your problem and evolve...but in order to be able to do this you need low entropy to even get this thought or understand it.

This is one critical aspect of belucid because it IMPLIES that you need to be a certain and specific evolved person at that exact moment to be able to decode the sequence that just happened in your actual, tangible, subjective objective reality.

Do you slowly start to see a "HOLY SHIT" aha-moment here?](<Thank you! This means the world to me..really..

This is exactly why Belucid will empower only the real ones, because Belucid is not a passive brainrot tool. You ACTUALLY need to live it so you can experience the results with every fibre of your being...in reality...not on your sceen.

What is best about Belucid is that you can see the aha moments on your screen but also get them to experience in real life. Wowweeeeee.>)

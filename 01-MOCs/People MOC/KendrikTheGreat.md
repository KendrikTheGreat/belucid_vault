My feeling about this persona is that he is actually a super villain.

Created through all the people who wronged him.
But he‚Äôs not petty about it or a pussy and crying like boo-hoo cry me a river‚Ä¶

I think that he is carrying all this anger, frustration and deep scars with him‚Ä¶all day‚Ä¶every day‚Ä¶
He knows that he could have prevented 90% of it if he had not been conditioned to back down or get grounded after standing up for himself.

He was definitely conditioned to be timid, quiet and fit in and don‚Äôt be a rebel.

I still hear it in my ears "Kendrik, why is it always that you rub the people and authorities the wrong way‚Ä¶."
Like I was the problem‚Ä¶no matter what‚Ä¶*YOU HAVE TO CHANGE KENDRIK. YOU‚ÄôRE THE PROBLEM* 
Didn‚Äôt matter that I was wronged‚Ä¶that I was bullied‚Ä¶
And the most fucked up thing was‚Ä¶I got even bigger problems and got twice the grounding because I was standing up for myself.
That is were the wolf leaderüê∫‚Ä¶that fucking alpha male died and became a timid chihuahuaüê∂

There are countless stories in my life to tell about how I had to back down so I could get "along" with others, stay in school

The reason I also need to pick this name is, that It's not about a status or a flex or whatever, first and foremost its about the idea that there is some version of me that has the potential actually to be the greatest of all time. Maybe not in Basketball but in IP or an Artwork or something about sports idk.
I want to chase that dude and I know he's out there.
So I want to define him and chase him...maybe I'll catch him one day before I die...maybe not...but at least I tried.

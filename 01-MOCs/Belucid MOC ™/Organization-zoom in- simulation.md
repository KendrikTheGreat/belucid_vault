You could pin down where your energy goes with the following set up:

- organization structure of one’s "mind", more like interest and life areas.
- Zoom in into an area and look for nodes that are connected because they happened and are actualized VS States.
- Now look at what happened and where the energy goes and what you could’ve learned from it.
- Simulate the different states in various branches 

I need this in basic flow chart and Animated!!

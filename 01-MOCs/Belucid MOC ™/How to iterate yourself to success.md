You need to make enough great choices to get to that one point where you can find success.

But it needs that vector state and you have to get there by making the right choices and find that path.

I will build the outline for that

[[Steve Jobs]]

- Filter: Looking to buid great products. To do something great.
- He had to be a certain way to be able to detect great product ideas
- And its not only DNA and character or inclinations, it’s the **filter you operate on**

He also had a great Orbit™️ with [[Steve Wozniak]], the crack, the magician.
And he instantly knew to potential.
Like an inventing cell you observe until it hits something magical, amazing and you can operate on it and iterate to success.

This is amazing to recognize and think about it!

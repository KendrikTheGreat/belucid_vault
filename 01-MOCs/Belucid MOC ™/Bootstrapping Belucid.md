# What can I do now?

- Bootstrap Belucid with Content and gain a following to monetize through:
	- Newsletter 
	- Gateway drug products
	- Sponsorships/ Ambassador for other brands - Through Podcast / YouTube or paid advertisement 

- Also good to gain data and insights who my cohorts are

When I’m at a different level and position to invest money:
- Build Software
- Build Website (can do it earlier with own money)
- Create a Start-Up with investors (Maybe not the core Idea but a sub devision so the main thing stays in my control )
- Looking for angels to invest in my idea

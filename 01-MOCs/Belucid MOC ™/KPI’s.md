Right now, I spent too much time on socials and other bullshit…
it’s actually sad…
Last week I had almost 8 hours on Instagram…like the fuck?
And I even started with "Brilliant" to switch that time and learn something useful instead of wasting my life.

Spending unnecessary time on my phone is stuff that ordinary people do.

Ordinary people:
- watch Netflix/YouTube for Entertainment
- Spent too much time on the phone for brain rot entertainment 
- Just waste time in general 

I still waste a lot of time and its starting to get sad.

[Update]
Limited my time to 15 mins a day for both X and Instagram.

I will try to pick up a book or go on brilliant.
Let’s see what I will do if I want to have entertainment.

I still waste too much time in my life with entertainment.

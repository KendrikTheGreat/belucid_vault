Let's take it up a notch and assign points and Levels.
The best is to design a basic Level System like the one I am currently experiencing with the App "Brilliant".

Also, I need to develop a point system for completed Tasks and where to count them.

I also do this to get better at defining [[VS]] that I'm striving for.
For if there's a [[VS]] out there that takes me 50 4 am's with running 10KM and 500 productive hours that is a significantly better me, I'll take it.
I need to start somewhere...
Let's try it this way...

I should also categorize with an overall Level and subcategories.
Otherwise, it could get too easy to "cheat" with "simple" tasks to get to a certain point.
I need to define plateaus and specific achievements to level up or get to the next level and so on...

Most importantly, this should help and motivate me and not take more time to build the actual thing.

I started to use Tickets and a fixed number that I can assign to the task so they're trackable

*First try to build my system. It's not perfect. It's raw, naive and lousy. Exactly what I need to get my foot in the door.

# GAINXP
- **EDTs** #1000
	- For each EDT, I should get 10 XP. Because they aren't a big deal.
	  I won't list them all name by name and just with the count. 
- **MATs** #2000
	- Those should be rewarded a bit more because they're more focused.
	  I would say, depending on the difficulty and the impact, let's say 20 XP-50 XP
- **OFTs** #3000
	- Those are the real ones. 
	  Getting up at 04:30 AM to run? Hell yeah. 200 XP 
	  Gym? at least 75 XP
	  Grinding it out - Tunnel sesh? 100 XP
- **BFTs** #4000
	- Depends on what I'm doing and in which category it falls but let's say I get 50 XP for each 
- **SOTs** #5000
	- Everything that has to do with structure and organization.
	  Obsidian and Concepts

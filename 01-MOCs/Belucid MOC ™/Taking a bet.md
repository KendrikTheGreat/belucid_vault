Interesting how it caught me off guard when I realized you don’t need to have everything sorted out to begin a venture or build something.

In [[Interstellar]] Dr. Brand said, that they started to build the centrifugal Space Station (Later Cooper Station) after he started working on his theory but he never finishes it.

So they build a multi-million dollar space station without having assurances that his theory will work.

Taking a bet is about having confidence in your thesis or theory and sell the vision, so other people can join the venture.

It is something deeply satisfying so see a venture bloom and working out after everyone took a bet

I want to document and film everything I do and why I do it.
If I'm not good yet at those perfect edited short form videos, I need to start with long, raw, uncut videos that are just documenting what I'm doing.

Like, if I have an idea where and how I put it down, where I'm going with this and so on...
Showing how I edit, animate and what my Idea is behind this and that.

If I'm starting now, I can have footage of DAY 1.

Like in the Kanye Docu [[Jeen-Yuhs]]

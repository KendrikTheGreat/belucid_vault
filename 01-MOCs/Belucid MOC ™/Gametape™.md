In Team sports like Basketball, Football, Soccer etc you watch Gametape to figure other people out.
- How they operate
- Their movement
- Their Behavior
- Their Rituals
- Their habits
- Strengths and weaknesses

You do this to prepare yourself of what could come and how you can counter it or play the situation.

I'm gonna do the same thing with Belucid.
You'll learn to anticipate people's Behavior, how they think and operate, what makes them tick and then develop strategies to gain the upper hand, have an edge over them, be prepared, have an advantage

It started when I was making music with [[Andre]] and we tried out different styles.
It was then when I realized how quickly you could iterate trough between different styles and maybe fill empty gaps in the market/ industry.

It’s the same with the free market and business.
Look for an opportunity and branch out in different directions to hit the style that people can relate to and identify— like hitting [[PMF]].

You can hit so many different niches or spawn a new one and gain millions of followers based on that style.
Good thing is, new branches and genres are created every year.

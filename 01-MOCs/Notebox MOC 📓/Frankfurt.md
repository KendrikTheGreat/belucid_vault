A few days ago before falling asleep, I had some thoughts about my time in Frankfurt.
Mostly about how it felt going to the gym and my way from the [[O50]] to Riedberg. 
I really liked the way, it was short, nice and I would have loved to live in Riedberg for a bit.
You need a great Skyline view, nice Neighbourhood, Gym, and Rewe.

I loved going to the gym early these days, coming back, making a cup of French Pressed Coffee with Oatmilk. The taste was kinda bad but when you get used to it, you really like it for some kind of reason. 
Eating Harzer KÃ¤se rolls and then working a bit.
I also loved my room...great room.
Great Home and house as well...just the living Situation with [[Merry]] was exhausting.
But this I will cover some other time, not now.
- Concept about [[toxic behavior]] and it's roots and how it evolves and grows and plays out.

The problem was, that I was playing a game I couldn't win and I knew that.
She had me after the first big fight and after that, she used every energy she had to prepare the next attack in her mind.

People who don't hold ideas in their minds and are not plotting what they could build next,
They often channel that energy to plot their next attack on somebody.
They use that energy to think about who is getting on their nerves and how they can take revenge. 
They daydream about negative situations, and when they do appear and manifest, they're feeding off of that negativity because they were right about their predictions.
They're already pissed off, because they hold that grudge in their minds against that specific person and when they do get the chance to confront that person, they use all the biased context they've made up in their mind and you cannot win against that person or even debate neutrally with him/her.
That is why those people are dangerous. 
They're experts with their sharp tongue. 
They condition themselves to be ready for a confrontation...all...the...time!
Don't get into a fight with someone like this.
Stay the fuck away from such people.
Try to avoid them.
You cannot win.
You can only identify those fuckers.
Heres how:
They already seem to be "loaded", looking for a trigger.
They kind of have the perfect rehearsed response, kind of weirdly being prepared for the "random" confrontation 
They won't give you a chance at all. They already made up their mind and you are their prey for dumping all their negative energy.
They're not reasonable, look for logic or any chance of a solution

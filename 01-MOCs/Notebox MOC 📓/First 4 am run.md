Getting up wasn't the hard part, trying to sleep was.
I was kinda nervous and I felt like my heart is missing some beats and is arhythmic as fuck.
I never have such kinds of problems with my heart. 
Never felt it.

Maybe I knew this is it.
This is how I get to that motherfucker I've always strived to be.
I want him.
And he wants me.
But for now, I'm here, and he's not even living on this planet.
Off the charts that dude.
But I'm coming for ya.

Amazing feeling to have done it and it wasn't even that hard...I'm livid that it was only 8.5km and not 10km. I could have sworn that it is that. And the crazy thing is that my legs would have easily carried me another 2km...my legs would have carried me another 2km easily.
Next time I'll get it! 
[[Mind games]] weren't also too difficult. 
Listened to my man [[Gary Vee]], great pod.
It was also about perspective on life and to do what you're meant do be.

**"If it's itching and burning every minute of your existence, 
don't do it, you're not made for it"**

This is why I need to do it.
Messed up my life up because I'm living in my head, entertaining my own world for the last 4 years now.

### How would my process of "becoming more fully me" look like over the next year?

### Where do you wish to grow?

### What kind of person are you yearning to be?

### If you were writing the chapter of the next year of your life, what would the theme be?


I would continue with the process of working on my Demons and the sins they commit so they won't have any control over me anymore.

I wish to grow into that person my inner child would look up to. I wanna make Kenny from Kindergarten that could create non-stop proud.

I yearn to be that inspirational thinker and leader in the field of consciousness and systematic thinking. I have the feeling that I need to express my work to a large audience.
I think that this version of myself has the most control and energy to create freely.

If I could write next year's chapter, the name would be Chaos vs. Order. I would try to make the theme something like a documentary like in Yeen Juuz and put my story into an amazing story to follow and gaze at.
It should be inspiring and have a kind of sense of mysticism.

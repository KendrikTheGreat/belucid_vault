People aren’t rational or logical,
that’s why we have to take them as they are.
Like plants, or passing comets in the sky.
We can’t change them.
But we can learn to understand them,
and work with what we got.

To some extant we can work with different types of characters and maybe nudge them into a direction but only they can help themselves to change, to prosper, to grow into something we want.
Thats why the idea of [[Inception]] is beautiful,
because we learn to invest in some people and see if an idea grows or not.

Can also be used to manipulate people…

**James Worthy: 

"I'm walking off the floor after a two-and-a-half hour practice, drenched in sweat and tired but Micheal pushed me back for a 1 on 1 to see who was better. He wanted to see where his game was.
I was better than he was, for about 2 weeks."
He wanted to learn.
He wanted to grow quickly.
From month to month, from game to game, he was soaking up information.
Once he got something and added it to the raw talent that he already had,
it was explosive to see.

**Jordan

From the first day in practice, my mentality was whoever is the team leader on this team,
I'm going after him.
And I'm not doing it with my voice because I had no voice.
I had no status.
I have to do it with the way I play.

**B.J. Armstrong**
- "Starting with that season, I felt Michael never played basketball anymore.
  He just figured out how to win the game.
  He knew how to *steer momentum*, he knew how to get guys going.
  He was just *playing a different game* than the rest of us"

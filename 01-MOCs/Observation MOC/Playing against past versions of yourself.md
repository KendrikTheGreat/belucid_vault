This is something that I discovered from the [[Joe Rogan]] Podcast with [[Magnus Carlson]].

He made an AI where you can play against past versions of himself.
Starting from a younger age and Elo Rate to later in his life and his prime.

This is a crazy idea because a neural network can learn from his past games and can be set to a specific timeframe.

Like from 10-15 and Elo 2500-2800 for example.

I can use that as a framework to let you play against yourself or see how you would’ve made choices in the past.

# How a past version of yourself would’ve make choices

### What he or she would have chose
### How and why
### With what Intent

Moneyball, fuck yes.
>[!HINT]- Leader
A great, strong willing leader up front that knows how to get shit done and communicates clear and simple what he wants, what he does and why he does it.
What a stud. Billy Bean. What a name even.

Second, his guy, the crack. Peter fucking brand.
What a way to disrupt a whole franchise, no, not just a sports franchise, the entire fucking game.
At the end, the Owner of the Red Sox said "Everybody that is not rebuilding the team until October will be left behind and stays a dinosaur"
So...both of them took immense risks and lost...oh yeah, they lost A LOT..they got shit on...doubted and written off...but they turned around..and turning around they did with a bang that shook up the sport for good.

What I'm most impressed is, that you can be a crack and get overseen for a long period, but someday, your day will come and someone will recognize your gift.
Best case, this person takes you under his or her wings and use that gift for good.
I mean, maybe my time will come at the perfect moment and my abilities will be recognized and paid off more than fair.

They both (Billy and Peter) changed the game for ever and now there is no turning back, no escape to the newly shaped reality. Straight facts, no bullshit. 
The funny thing is, even after they proved the concept, they still were doubted and written off as "See, we told you this won't work in the end".
I hate people. I don't know why, but to be frank, I hate most people. The fucking herd of mediocre people and everybody has an opinion and a "solid" knowledge about what you want to say or do. 
I'm done with it. 
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em all.

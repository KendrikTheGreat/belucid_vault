If I keep being employed and getting judged by my degree, I will only look like a loser or someone that isn’t going places.

Some time ago I was more aggressive against people who were choosing the regular way and I kept telling them how stupid the 9/5 is.

But this approach won’t get you far and you’ll look like on of those idiots that are in MLM Schemes or sales.
Just newbies in the game that live by hustle porn and motivation quotes.

Not real ballers.

I got more quiet and accepted their view but what makes me angry is that I started to explain myself and justify why I’m not in an apprenticeship or why I’m not studying yada yada yada.

That is not fucking me.

And I’m so done getting judged by it + always having to tell some bullshit story and talking about the same stupid lame question.

And I can also be the guy like "uuuh, why are you not building something for yourself?!"

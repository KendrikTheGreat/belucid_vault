Joe Rogan’s new Podcast #2259 is with no one other than our one and only Thomas Campbell…wow.
I kind of get FOMO rn. 
If I miss the trend/hype/mainstream moment…I’d be FUCKING RAGING.

I can’t miss this huge opportunity.
I saw it 3 years ago but I was waiting and waiting and being complacent.
I can’t wait anymore or I will miss the moment…

Enough people are aware now.
I can make my moves, but I need to start ASAP.


“I am a physicist, I wanna model reality”
that sticks with me!

Been listening now for 20 minutes.
Ideas are springing again and I’m retelling the story in my head over and over again on how I started to read the book, how I found it and what my experience was.

I always knew that there has to be more to reality because of my experiences that were hard to explain.
My thing was, that I kind of could control my learning experiences.
When I knew I had to learn something or go through some situations in order to grow, I listened closely and intuitively interpreted the “data” I got from people around me.
All sorts of people..yes, even homeless people.
But most friends and strangers. 

[!NOTE] Strangers have a different kind of interesting energy to them! 

They can say anything to you without a bias or agenda, because they don’t need to give a fuck. Vice versa is the norm, people just wear their masks and act like the person they’ve conditioned themselves into.

But when they’re real with you, and you know it, because you can feel if someone is earnest and candor with you, 
sometimes they drop bangers, nuggets and just gas. 

Pure fuel for the soul to grasp and learn from.
The thing is, you can up the odds to have more of those interactions.
At least, that is what I’ve learned

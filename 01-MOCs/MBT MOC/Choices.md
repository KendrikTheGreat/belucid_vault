Making [[low entropy]] choices helps you gather better information and data.

Choices with good intent out of love (caring) and peace within oneself.
Those choices don’t need a lot of energy and are calm with a peace of mind.

Why didn’t you see the good choice?
If you made a choice (out of good and positive intent) and it was a good one and helped you grow, then nice, patt your own shoulders and carry on.
If you made a bad choice and you have the character to reflect on it, then try to see why you made that choice and why you couldn’t see the better option.
Learn from your mistakes and carry on.

I love how [[Gary Vee]] impersonates this [[Character Attributes]].
- He is overly positive and kind.
- Doesn’t fear to make mistakes and learn from them.
- Really tries to be a role model and spread love and caring for each other
- Preaches about being yourself and do what you love and really want to do

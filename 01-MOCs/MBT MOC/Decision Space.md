Probability distribution of possibilities 

A bad model tries to be close to what is already known.
A good model however is judged by:
- how well it’s functioning
- how well it works
- does it come up with new things we don’t know that later turns out to be true
- does it have just a few assumptions 
- it is simple and elegant 
- can be tracked back to a fundamental truth or fundamental way

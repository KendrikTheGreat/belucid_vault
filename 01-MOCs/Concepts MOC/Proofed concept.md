You can see when there has been a game changer like in

- Fortnite with the Battle Pass
- CSGO with the cases and Eco System

Now all games look the same.
You but the game and if its great or not doesn’t decide how much money you can make.
It’s actually within the game and the digital items you can purchase.
An own world/ ecosystem within a game.

People buy skins, textures, packages to express themselves within the game.

They maybe buy the game to play with friends but to really express themselves and enjoy the game, nowadays you kind of feel pressured to buy add ons and the DLC’s and the skins etc.


One changes the game and it swaps all over the industry.
There are proofed concepts that you can take and built on because people are already used to the mechanics and "Game Engines".

But to truly stand out, you need to develop your own mechanics and engines.
For the one who can provide better systems to help people advance or evolve

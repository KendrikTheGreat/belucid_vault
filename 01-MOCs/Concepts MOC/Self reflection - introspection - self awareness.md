Self reflection - introspection - self awareness
Some people don't have it and its. a big problem, because they won't ever learn what they're doing wrong and how they can fix it.

They need to watch their flow charts and organizations and their last actions (choices they made and with what intent)

High valuable skill.
If you don't have it.
You'll never learn.

Concept:

Organizational Structure with flow charts and choices etc. that represent the last few states and branches of a person.
Showing in 3rd person perspective what they could've done and it need to be clear and shown, that the figure is looking at the past structure.

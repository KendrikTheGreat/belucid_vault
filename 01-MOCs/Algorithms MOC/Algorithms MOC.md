How to plan and structure my life: [[My Protocol]]

# Planning Structure
### Morning
- Plan the day ahead
- Only ***Work-Blocks*** come into my **Apple Calendar**.
	- Like 2 hours of concept writing or 1 hour AE or 1 hour reading.
- ***Every-Day-Tasks*** [EDTs] can be put into the **Reminders App**
	- Only stuff that isn't that critical but needs to be done
	- Can be important or work related but shouldn't be the first front
- 
### Evening

When is the best time for me to be creative - productive - sporty - reflective? 

I guess I can reflect the best before going to bed, so maybe it should be the last thing I'm doing before going to sleep. I should even process the data in my sleep.

New Experiment:
Which time to get up und get to bed is best for me and which tasks can be best done between 06:00 am and 07:30 am.
If I get up at 5 AM, go for a run, take a shower and eat something, am I ready to work at 6?

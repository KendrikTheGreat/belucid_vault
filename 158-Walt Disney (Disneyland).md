“One day in the early 1950s, Walt Disney stood looking out over 240 acres of farmland in Anaheim, California. And imagine building a park where people could live among Mickey Mouse and Snow White in a world still powered by steam and fire, for a day or a week or if the visitor is slightly mad, forever. Despite his fame and success, exactly no one wanted Disney to build such a park. Not his brother Roy, who ran the company's finances, not the bankers, and not his wife Lillian. Amusement parks at that time were a generally despised business. Disney was told that he would be headed towards financial ruin but Walt persevered, initially financing the park against his own life insurance policy. He assembled a talented team of engineers, architects, artists, animators, landscapers, and even a retired admiral to transform his ideas into a soaring yet soothing wonderland. The catch was that they only had a year and a day in which to build it. On July 17, 1955, Disneyland opened its gates and the first day was a disaster. Disney was nearly suicidal with grief that he had failed on a grand scale but the curious masses kept coming and the rest is entertainment history. 800 million visitors have flocked to the iconic park since then. In Disney's Land, popular historian Richard Snow brilliantly presents the entire spectacular story. A wild ride from vision to realization that reflects the uniqueness of the man determined to build the happiest place on earth with a watchmaker's precision, an artist’s conviction, and the desperate high-hearted recklessness of a river boat gambler.”

That was from the back cover of the book I'm going to talk about today which is, Disney's Land: Walt Disney and the Invention of the Amusement Park That Changed the World and it’s written by Richard Snow. So I actually found this book -- I wasn't expecting to do this book this week. I was in a bookstore, just randomly looking through the biography in the business section. And I saw this book. I picked it up, read that back cover, and I was like, oh, I'm going to buy this right now. And then I started reading it, and I couldn't put it down. So that's a great indicator that that's the book that I should be talking about this week. And what I didn't realize until after I had already started reading the book, was that I had read another one of Richard Snow's books. So I think all the way back on Founders #8, maybe, I read his book called, “I Invented the Modern Age, The Rise of Henry Ford.” And there's a paragraph in that book that I thought was just hilarious. It's how he came up with the name of that book. I'm just going to read to you real quick. “One day towards the end of his life, Ford was talking with a local high school boy named John Dillinger, and they got into the subject of education. Ford spoke of the virtues of the McGuffey Reader era. That's how he educated himself when he was younger, and that sounded pretty fuzzy to Dillinger. ‘But sir,’ he protested. ‘These are different times. This is the modern age and -- ‘Young man,’ Ford snapped, ‘I invented the modern age.’ The claim is as prosperous as it is megalomaniacal. It is also largely true.” That's one of my favorite paragraphs that Richard Snow ever wrote. I thought it was fantastic the way he sums that up. So back to Disney, this is the third book I read on him. I was actually shocked I went back. So I've done Founders #2 and Founders #39 on Disney. And I cannot believe I let this much time pass before reading another book on him. He's one of the most influential entrepreneurs and inspiring entrepreneurs to ever live.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I want to read this quote that's at the very beginning of the book, which I found remarkable because when I read The Triumph of the American Imagination by Neal Gabler, that was the one -- the book I covered on -- it’s the most comprehensive biography of Walt Disney, I think ever written. It was on Founders #2. I was really shocked because going into that book, I knew of Disney do animation, do cartoons. I didn't know his favorite project he ever worked on was Disneyland. And so I want to read this quote, that's right at the beginning book. It says, “When he reached middle age, it seemed that we were going to win this an all too familiar process. The conversion of the tired artists into the tired businessmen. When in 1955, we heard that Disney had opened an amusement park under his own name, it appeared certain that we would not look forward to anything new for Mr. Disney. We were quite wrong. He had instead created his masterpiece.” So I want to start with a good way to think about the importance of Disneyland and then getting into Walt’s earlier life. So it says, “Disneyland is the extension of the powerful personality of one man. It is not, like many perfectly good modern theme parks, a consensus on what might make a nice place.” So if you're -- this is the first time you're studying and learning about Walt Disney, I would -- he was an obsessive with soul in the game. I put him up there with people, the fanatical people that were very concerned about the quality of their products like Steve Jobs, Enzo Ferrari, Henry Royce of Rolls-Royce fame. He is the same exact breed of person. And so the idea that he's going to design from consensus is just not going to happen. “At the age of nine, Walt was climbing out of bed every morning at 3:30 in the morning to go to work. He was delivering newspapers in the snow. Disney's father didn't believe children should have toys, but on nice mornings, I used to come to houses with those big old porches and the kids would have left some of their toys out. I would find them and play with them. They're on the porch at four in the morning when it was just barely getting light. Then I'd have to tear back and go back to my paper route again.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

More about his father, his joyless father. “His father incubated a peculiar joyless blend of grim protestant work ethic and socialism. His mother did her best to soften things for the boys. Sometimes handing them slices of bread buttered on the bottom, so their father wouldn't see them being spoiled with such a luxury.” So his father was a very hard man, just like Disney winds up being very stingy with praise. And as soon as all of his sons got to the age, they try to go as far away from him as possible. So it gives you an idea of its early life, does not sound like a very nice person to be around. “Their farm” -- this is before they move to the city. They're working at the farm, Disney is really young. “Their farm like every farm demanded hard work, which, in this case, was thankless. Elias Disney,” that's his father's name, “believed that using fertilizer on a crop was like giving whiskey to an alcoholic. He refused to do it with the predictable results.” And this is where the author goes into like growing up in this kind of environment, how this probably influenced what Disney chose to work on later in his life. “For one who spent so much of his working life celebrating the virtues of family, he was eager to get away from his. He was turned down by the army because of his youth, so he forged an earlier date on his birth certificate. And in September of 1918, the 16-year-old joined the Red Cross as an ambulance driver. He arrived in France shortly after.” It was very surprising to me. I read the biography of Ray Kroc, the founder of the McDonald's franchise system. And he talked about -- he volunteered for the Red Cross and he served in France during World War I. He says, “There was this strange kid.” This is in his book Grinding It Out. He says, “There was this strange kid that when we all went out and got drinks or went out at the party at night, he would stay back in the barracks and draw cartoons.” He's like, “His name was Walt Disney.” So he actually served in the same Red Cross division, which is interesting.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“He talked -- so he comes back after the war is over. He talked his way into an enterprise called the Pesmen-Rubin Commercial Art Studio.” This is where he starts drawing and doing marketing for companies. “For a few weeks, he had a fine time making advertising layouts, and writing copy and he is writing program covers for local movie houses. Disney” -- this was a seasonal job. So he winds up getting let go. “Disney was out on the January streets along with another brief hire.” This is -- somebody becomes rather important. It is one of his first business partners, this guy named Ub Iwerks. I have no idea if I'm pronouncing that correctly, by the way. “Disney liked Iwerks and suggested the optimistic idea that they form a partnership. They did. The fetal business foundered in weeks, but Disney wrangled a job that's” -- he has, I think, 2 -- at least 2 failed companies before he starts The Disney Company, maybe even 3. “The fetal business foundered in weeks, but Disney wrangled a job at the Kansas City Film Ad Company.” So before he moves to California, he's in Kansas, Kansas City. “And soon, he got the firm to hire Iwerks. Their new employer produced minute-long promotional films for local businesses that ran in the city's movie houses. Even for that morning time of animation the very beginning days of the animation industry, these were crude. Disney knows” -- this -- the reason I bring this up is because in the next paragraph, this is something Disney does his entire life. “Disney immediately sought more advanced technology as he would for the rest of his career. He found books on animation, borrowed a camera, and started experimenting. He was” -- from the time he starts working until the time he dies, he's always focused on improving his work. “Soon, he was producing short cartoons, cartoon ads that he called Laugh-O-Grams, and then he made longer cartoons drawn from fairy tales. He went bankrupt in 1923 after completing an ambitious project called Alice's Wonderland. But he doesn't give up there. He sends out his work on Alice's Wonderland to a film distributor who is a film -- he send it to a film distributor named Margaret Winkler. She gave Disney a contract to make 6 Alice episodes.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So these are the very first cartoons he's making. He began hiring a larger staff and persuaded Ub Iwerks to join him again. Alice's Wonderland ran out of steam in 1927. Margaret Winkler had then turned over the distribution business to her husband Charles Mintz.” This guy is going to be a scumbag and a theme that we see through all these books is, they're constantly lecturing us, that you need to control. Anything that's important to your business or your work, you should control it. Disney says the same things because this guy is going to wind up ripping him off. “Who urged Disney to come up with something new that he could market through Universal Pictures. Disney responded with Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, which proved a solid success. He confidently went to meet with Mintz and asked for more money. Mintz offered him less money. Disney indignantly refused and discovered that not only the Universal own the rights to Oswald,” therefore, Disney didn't have control. “But that Mintz had hired away his entire animation staff. The steely distributor told him, either you come with me at my price or I'll take your organization away from you. Disney never hesitated.” You're not going to say that to somebody like Walt Disney. So he was like, all right, I'm out of here, I'm not coming with you. I'm going to start brand new. This is the lore of the creation of Mickey Mouse. He takes this long train ride back to California, from New York City. He's with his wife and on this -- the myth could be true. It's purported to be true that on that train ride is when he draws Mickey Mouse. He named -- he wants to name it Mortimer Mouse. And his wife was like that's the stupidest name ever, like that's a terrible name, and she actually gave him the name Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mouse was introduced to the world. For his third Mickey short, Disney hired an orchestra. And Steamboat Willie was the first sound cartoon. So we see him constantly wanting to innovate.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He made the first sound cartoon. He doesn't stop there. And what's amazing about the career of Walt Disney, is once he does something, he gets bored. He's not like I'm not going to sit here and just make more sound cartoons, then I'll make feature-length films and he just keeps going and going and always trying to expound on these ideas. “Mickey Mouse has a bigger following,” -- this is talking about how successful Mickey Mouse -- he built his entire empire. Later in his life, Disney has this great quote, he’s like, “I hope we never forget that it all started with a mouse.” So anyways, this Hollywood reporter is talking about how important Mickey Mouse, like how big it was. It says, “Mickey Mouse has a bigger following than 9/10 of the stars in Hollywood. Disney’s cartoons became subtler and more fluent. He added color to them and began to garner Academy Awards. In 1933,” -- and keep in mind this is 22 years before he starts working on Disneyland, right? “In 1933, he released, what one media historian has called, the most successful short animation of all time.” That's the Three Little Pigs. The whole story of Disney is just one innovation after another, one accolade after another. It's really remarkable. “Urged to make a sequel of the Three Little Pigs, he declined. His terse refusal, a fine showing business apothegm.” I don't know how to pronounce that word, but it's like a short saying, “You can't top pigs with pigs.” “He was tiring of making short films. In 1934, he embarked on making the first feature length cartoon. He had budgeted $0.5 million for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and it ended up consuming $1.5 million.” He was terrible with numbers. He has another great quote it’s like, “We're innovating, I'll tell you what it costs when we're done.” Same thing, I think he said -- he thought Disneyland was going to cost something like $1.5 million, something like that. Let's say, $2 million maybe and it wind up being $17 million, which I think is the equivalent of like $160 million today. So this is not surprising. He’s like yes, Snow White, I'll do it for -- I think I can do it for $0.5 million. So it winds up being what, 3x that. So it takes $1.5 million in 4 years. By the time it was released in 1937, and it had become known as, in Hollywood, as Disney's folly, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so everyone was like this guy is going to fail. Wrong. Snow White was a triumph, the biggest hit of 1938 and the most profitable sound film ever made. “The next couple of years were the most satisfying Disney would know until he began to toy with the idea of an amusement park. Things soured for him quickly. His next 2 features performed tepidly at the box office, partly because of the war” -- that's World War II, “partly because the war choked off his European market. Revenues dwindled, and he had to take his company public.” He almost lost his company actually. “And deep salary cuts triggered an ugly strike at the studio. The strike only lasted 5 weeks, but it left Disney with a lifelong grievance, one thing that he never got over.” And this is where he’s at the point of his life where he kind of -- he's looking for something new, he's not satisfied with his work anymore. He kind of goes off into like hobbies. And I wouldn't say he becomes a recluse but it's definitely withdrawn from the studio. This is what his daughter, Diane wrote about this time, “I think it was just after the war when nothing seemed to stimulate him. I could sort of sense it. I could tell he wasn't pleased with anything he was doing. One small enterprise did please him though, and it had little to do with the art that he had done so much to invent and of which he was the undisputed master.” That is a hell of a sentence. “The art he had done so much to invent and of which he was the undisputed master completely turned his back on animation. He was dismayed.” So this is a -- some guy comes to visit him, a film critic. I think he's at his house. It says, “He was dismayed to find the man whose work he had long admired seemed totally uninterested in movies and seemed wholly almost weirdly concerned with the building of a miniature railroad engine and a string of cars.” I'm going to pause here. I'll finish the rest of sentence in a minute. That's when I first read his -- Neal Gabler’s book. I was like, why is this guy spending so much time building this miniature replica of a railroad. I thought it was the weirdest like mid-life crisis one could have.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“All of his zest for invention, for creative fantasies seemed to be going into this play-thing.” And what's really interesting is talking about how he felt before he found something he could pour all his love and this is what I meant about like an obsessive, a soul in the game. If they don't have an outlet like the professional outlet is what they value most in life besides their family. And in some cases, like in Enzo Ferrari’s case, more than their family besides the son, obviously. He said, he never loved anybody except his son. He's like he didn't believe it was possible for a man to love a woman. I mean that's how extreme he was but he loved his cars. But anyways, there's -- I want to read this -- this is where Disney is on the verge of a nervous breakdown before Disneyland, okay? So there's also something in this book, not in this book, every -- the other two books I read about him too. He's got towards the end of his career. At the end of every day, on the studio lot, there's this -- he has a professional masseuse. Her name is Hazel George. He meets with her every day, strips down naked, drinks scotch and he is massaged by this woman. She's the last person he ever says goodbye to when he leaves the studio for the last time. So I'm going to bring it -- he's talking -- I'm going to tell you what he's saying during one of these massage sessions. “During their sessions in 1948, George -- Hazel George, began to sense that her boss was singing into what seemed to her to be a dangerous depression, perhaps a nervous breakdown. And this is not the first time in his career that this happened to him. He had one or something like one back in 1931. He said at that time that I had, had a hell of a breakdown. I went to pieces. I kept expecting more from the artist and when they -- and they let me down -- and when they let me down, I got worried. I would just pound, pound, pound. Costs were going up, and it was always way over what they figured the picture would bring in. I just got very irritable. I got to a point that I couldn't talk on the telephone. I would begin to cry. Now it seemed again to be just pound, pound, pound.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Once more, the money wasn't coming in. His last successful feature, Bambi, was 6 years in the past, and Cinderella was nowhere near finished. Disney was often aggrieved, abrupt and when not angry, he was remote.” And so this -- during this nervous breakdown and depression, he started spending less time at studio, start spending all this time building -- he's going to call it the Lilly Belle named after wife, this very realistic miniature railroad at the house he is building. It has got a tunnel. I mean it's -- I think HE spent like a couple of hundred thousand dollars on this thing. And he's going to different places all across the country, researching like he just became completely obsessed with locomotives and railroads. So he goes to this railroad fair with another one of his employees. And this is where he gets the blueprint. These are the early blueprints, the early inspiration for what he's eventually going to build at Disneyland. And he is at this railroad fair and this -- his idea -- at the time the amusement parks were thought of like they’re kind of ghetto like s**_, just s_** places to go. Well, you'd have like theme parks, built upon a theme that were temporary and they usually would be like a world fair or a fair -- like in this case, a railroad fair. And this is where he is going to get at a lot of ideas. So it says, “What impressed him most was -- were the fair’s ancillary exhibitions. One could see some of the spores that would blow into Disneyland in the guidebook subscription.” This is how they were marketing it. “In its acres of exhibits, the railroad fair offers hours of fascinating enjoyment, intriguing pageantry, invaluable education, taken back to the early days when an unbelievable American” -- no, that's not -- where’s that word, I got to go back a page, hold on. “When an unbelieving American looked at scans at the first wood-burning locomotive, you will move rapidly forward to the mammoth streamliners,” that's what they're calling the railroads, the modern railroads they are building our locomotives.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“They've beckoned their way into our own tomorrow. Each exhibit will prove an exciting and entirely different chapter in the steering melodrama. One railroad will take you into a primitive Indian countryside. Another to -- away to the playgrounds of Florida or the romantic old French Quarter of New Orleans.” So you have this circle, think of it like a wheel with spokes coming out. This is where you start and then you have all these lands. That's exactly what Disneyland is, right? It talks about they're dressed up. Everything in -- if you're going to the French Quarter of New Orleans, the people are speaking the right language. They have the same uniforms on that people would have in the back of the day. So he really takes this idea and runs with it. “There was gumbo to be had in the recreated French Quarter and the people who served it, were dressed in period costumes. The exhibits added up to a coherent hole, the growth of America told in 3 dimensions, a history lesson you can walk through. Although the terms still lay in the future, Walt Disney was visiting a theme park. Kimbell” -- that’s who he is with -- “And Disney stayed at the fair for several days. And then they made another crucial stop on their way home at Henry Ford's 20-year-old greenfield village.” I do not think Henry Ford was still alive at this time. As the richest American, he was able to collect on a titanic scale. So they're talking about the similarities between Henry Ford and Disney and one similar area is that they are both nostalgic. So it talks about some of the things Ford purchased and sent to this greenfield village. “He bought Thomas Edison's Menlo Park Laboratory. He collected the homes of people he admired. Noah Webster’s which is the slave cabin where George Washington Carver was born, Harvey Firestone’s childhood farm, a courthouse where Abraham Lincoln practiced law. These are actual buildings. he literally bought them and had them transported over here. “He acquired not only the Wright brothers house, but the bicycle shop where they conducted their momentous experiments. Ford was not recreating the past. Instead, he was building a vision of what most appeal to him about it. Ford's town was an entirely” -- this is the main point of why I'm telling you this about the section.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“Ford's town was an entirely personal reflection of the man. So would Disney's be the roadmap of Walt Disney's life.” So one thing Walt had to overcome is everybody told him, it was like, this is a dumb idea. Why like why are you building amusement park? They're terrible things. And I love this like they're saying something that's true. At the time amusement parks were terrible. He's like, that's the point. I have an opportunity because there's so much room for improvement. That's a very powerful idea. Why would you want to get involved in the amusement park. They're so dirty and not fun at all for grown-ups. Why would you want to get involved in a business like that? He filled the question the way he would countless times during Disneyland's germination. “That's exactly the point. Mine isn't going to be that way. Mine isn’t going to be a place that's clean where the whole family can do things together.” And that part reminds me of what Henry always said about he's like, "I didn't innovate when I was building the Rolls-Royce.” He's like, “I just made every single part of the -- that goes into an automobile better.” And it was a combination of those improvements that created something entirely new. I feel that's what Disney was doing when he was building upon the lack of quality from amusement parks. He’s like I'm going to improve every aspect of it, and I'm going to make it better. I'm going to make something new as a biproduct of that. This is how Walt described Disney a few years before it was built. Walt was quoted as saying, “Disneyland will be something of a fair, an exhibition, a playground, a community center, a museum of living facts, and a showplace of beauty and magic.” So as he gets going with the idea, he hires the Stanford Research Institute to find out where he should build the park. He has them doing the research and stuff. First, I thought it was really interesting, the 2 people they hired. Their names are Woody and Buzz which I found fascinating because what, 55 years later, Pixar is going to make a movie with the 2 main characters being Woody and Buzz and then Disney is going to buy that company. I just thought it was really weird or really interesting rather.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And this is what one of the guys, Buzz, his last name is Price. He's saying he was like, this is a bizarre -- this is his reaction to Disney's idea. So it says, “It sounded strange. Unlike anything you would expect an amusement park. At the time when most parks were planned as a grid with foresight access, Disney outlined a design concept of a single park entrance passing through a turn-of-the-century Main Street, which would end in a circular plaza or town square. The area would then feed off readily into 4 thematic activity areas, The World of Tomorrow, Fantasyland, Frontierland, and Adventureland. Whereas most amusement parks wanted all the street visibility they can get, Walt's entire park would be hidden from the outside world. He was talking about customized rides, exhibits, and attractions instead of the standard off-the-shelf Ferris wheel and tunnel of love. Rides would be subordinate to the story and setting. Most shockingly, there were no thrill rides. Price could not imagine such a place without the roller coaster. But most alarming, this entertainment anomaly had to be opened in just 2 years.” So once he secures the land in Anaheim, which is like just orange groves at the time, he's bringing a bunch of his friends out usually like one on one. And he just brings them out there. He sees -- the people he brings to see is just a giant field of orange groves, right? But Disney is visualizing and telling the story of what this will be -- he's going to transform this into. And this was funny to me. This is a friend's response to Disney's plan. “While he talked, becoming more and more enthusiastic by the minute, I had begun to grow more and more concerned. I hardly knew how to tell him for once that he was making what would probably be the biggest, most ruinous mistake of his life. What could I say? I knew he was wrong.” And I thought that was funny, because that sentence seems like I knew Disney was wrong, and I knew he was wrong.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Everybody said that to him. So Disney sets up the secondary company outside of Disney Studio. He starts funding this. He sells his house, he borrows against his life insurance. Eventually, he's got to bring his brother into this because as a brother is the one that always took care of finances for the main Disney company. And so this -- his brother’s name is Roy. And Roy just has a great way. He's going to -- he's telling the story about their relationship. He's Disney's older brother and one, the story made me laugh. And two, it's a great way to think about Disney’s life, just his -- he just would not give up his persistent personality, always pushing forward. It is very interesting. So it says, “Roy Disney, once told of an incident that happened back in the days 60 years earlier. Walt found a pocket knife. He was 5 years old and I was 13. I said, look, you can't trust yourself with a knife, you'll cut yourself. And I took the knife away from him. Roy was remembering this because the brothers had recently had a squabble and Walt accused me of bullying him and throwing my weight around, and he says, you've been doing that since I was born. I remember you took that knife away from me. Roy saw the fraternal equation differently. When Walt and I were on the farm, we had to sleep in the same bed. Now Walt was just a little guy, and he was always wetting the bed, and he's been peeing on me ever since.” And so as you imagine, Roy sees how determined his brother is. And this is really Roy on the futility of trying to stop Walt, and he's calling him Junior. He's talking about this idea for a theme park. “Junior has got his hand in the cookie jar again. He may have said it fatalistically because he knew that a determined Junior was almost impossible to dissuade.” And so you have to -- when you're studying the career of Walt Disney, you have to bring up Roy because Walt would have never succeeded without his brother.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

There's 2 things that are happening on this page that I thought was interesting. This is when -- the very early days of the Walt Disney Company. Walt eventually hires other animators, and he stops drawing himself. And he says something that was surprising. He says, “I was never happy with anything I did as an artist.” And then this is Roy's perspective, understanding how valuable his brother was to the Disney Company. He says, “He never lost his calm understanding that the company's prosperity rested not on the rock of conventional business practices. But on the churning extravagant perfectionist imagination of his younger brother.” Okay, moving on. So one of the smartest things I think Disney did was he’s like where am I going to get the financing for this park, right? The banks will lend me a little bit, but I got to have a major sponsor. So at the time, Disney reminds me of George Lucas, where he was always -- I think, somewhere back in the 30s, maybe 35, Founders 35 or something like that I read the biography of George Lucas, he was always focused on the next medium of storytelling. And he would -- a lot of people ran away from it, but he would go towards it and try to improve on it. Disney was the same way. So a lot of people, a lot of animators, and people in the movie business thought television was terrible like it's going to be bad for their business. He is like, “No, it's going to be good for my business.” So at the time, all the different TV networks would want a TV show from Disney. And so like Disney says, okay, I'm going to do a TV show. But to get my TV show, you have to finance my park. So it's like the presenting sponsor of Disneyland. And NBC turns him down. What's the other one? CBS, maybe. Yes, CBS. ABC, which at the time had the moniker almost broadcasting company because it was like the minor one jumped at the advantage -- excuse me, jumped at the opportunity rather. And so he just -- I'm going to read. A bunch of stuff is happening here, but basically, Roy is about to go to the Northeast and pitch all the different networks on this new TV series that Disney is doing and saying, hey, to get the TV series, you need to pay for the park, too, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So Disney -- before this can happen, though, they don't have -- there's no like what's the idea? So Disney is like I'm going to have a drawing then. Disney calls up a former employee on a Saturday morning, okay? This guy does not work for him anymore. He meets with him to tell him about Disneyland. Then he asked him to draw a rendering by Monday so Roy then could take it to pitch to TV networks, right? And the guy is like, hell no. Like I'm not doing this and Disney offers to stay with him the entire time. So they wind up working 40 hours straight to get the rendering done so Roy can take it and see this is out of the mind of Walt Disney, this is what it's going to look like. So it says, “40 hours after Disney's phone call, Ryman set down his pencil, the 2 men looked at the finished work. What they conjured from Disney's vision and Ryman's patient skill was remarkably close to what, two years and many millions of dollars later would rise from the vanished orange groves of Anaheim, California to tease the imagination of the entire world.” And so this is a little bit about Disney realizing the importance of TV early and then just a great perspective on new industries that he's going to intersection with. One of the reasons Disney broke with the United Artists in 1936 was they're pushing for the television rights to his films, something he refused to consider even at the time when there were perhaps 2,000 television receivers in the entire world. “By 1948, he was saying publicly that the newcomer would help rather than harm the motion picture industry. A view that proved highly controversial in the next few years when the studios came to regard television as a homeowner does termites. Bill Walsh, remember that he was going through a period of frequently running into his Boston hallways and parking lots when one day Disney stopped him and said, ‘You, you're going to be the producer of my TV show.’” This is the TV show he is making to advertise Disneyland, which is one big advertisement, but it's also like new programming for ABC, right?

So he’s like, “’You're going to be the producer of my TV show.” Walsh was dumb founded, huh, but I don’t have any experience as a television producer.” And this is what I meant about this is just a fantastic perspective on new industries. “’Who does?’ Walt said, and that was that.” Now this next part, I absolutely love. These guys that he hired from the Stanford Research Institute are going to like an amusement park owner’s convention kind of thing. And they gave a presentation for what -- Disneyland, what it's going to be, hasn't been built yet. And this is what other amusement park owners said, which I love. “The reaction was unanimous, Disneyland would not work. They took” -- Price -- Buzz Price, this is the guy giving the presentation, “took careful notes of the negative remarks. There were no positive ones. Beginning with all the proven moneymakers are missing, no roller coasters, no Ferris wheel, no carnival games like the baseball throw. They said, without barkers along the midway” -- these are direct quotes from the meeting, right? “Without barkers along the midway to sell the side shows, the marks won't go in.” Listen to how they're describing their customers. Marks. What does that tell you? “There wasn't enough ride capacity to make a profit, but that was irrelevant because custom rides will never work. Anyway, they're too costly to build and liable to break down. And besides, the public doesn't know the difference or care.” Again, they're describing their customers. They have disdain for their customers. “Many of Disney’s favorite projects made no sense at all. Things like the castle and the pirate ship are cute, but they aren't rides. So there's no economic reason to build them. And Main Street is loaded with things that don't produce revenue. Walt’s screwy ideas about cleanliness and great landscape maintenance are economic suicide.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Listen to everything they're saying, this is really wild. “He will lose his shirt by overspending on things the customer never really notices, tell your boss to save his money. Tell him to stick to what he knows and leave the amusement business to people who know it. The dire litany didn't frighten Walt Disney. That audience, those guys who called a paying customer a mark couldn't grasp what he had in mind.” So now let me compare and contrast. You clearly see through their remarks how they think about their business, right? These are just s*** people, and they have s*** products. This is how Walt is describing. This is before it's built. This is, I guess, as they're building them, right? This is how he describes it. And then at the end of this, who would you want -- like who do you want to support? Who do you want to give your money to? Who do you want to be a customer of? Listen to this. “Walt wanted something more akin to a motion picture than an amusement park.” This is a direct quote from him, “In designing Disneyland, we thought of the park as if it were a 3-dimensional film. We wanted everything that guests experience.” Guests, he didn’t call them marks, he didn’t call them suckers, he didn't call them idiots. Guests. “We wanted everything that guests experience, not only the show and the ride to be an entertaining part of the story. This was a new idea. We took the most basic needs of guests and turned them into attractions.” Okay, so moving on. The reason I think I love this book so much and the reason I recommend people to read is because really the -- it's the history of Disneyland, right, and you see the personality of the person that built it. I would say the history -- the development and creation of Disneyland, it's like a microcosm for the creation of any kind of worthy endeavor. It was like a new company or whatever the case is. And you see the inevitable ups and downs. This is very interesting.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And something I was -- this next few sentences, I'm going to read you. What I really thought, I was like, d_*_, this was not -- it was not easy to not quit. It was an almost impossible goal to have. And I think reading about something that seemed impossible from the outside and it winds up being successfully completed is very inspiring. So he's about to run out of money again. So it says, “One day Disney took Harper Goff, this is one of his employees up to a temporary wooden observation tower, his crew had knocked together in the middle of the site. So there's very little done, but he's spending a lot of money. I have half the money spent, he told Goff, and nothing to show for it. Goff saw tears in his eyes as he repeated, nothing.” So at the same time that they're developing Disneyland, they have to make an entirely new series. And when you figure out like how important this TV show ends up being, it winds up being -- when you -- I think it was like 180 million Americans at the time, over 52% tuned in to watch the show. They said like that percentage has never been duplicated in the Super Bowl, no MAS*H, no anything as far as like a percentage of the total population that watch the same show, right? And so that's also something that's unbelievably important. And I think what Disney does here, more founders should do this. They're in -- the founders are in the best position to tell the customers why their product exists, right? Instead of going to another website, you see some random template you've seen a million times with a bunch of copy like why isn't there a video of just the founder or an audio or whatever it is to say, hey, this is my name. This is what I built, but this is why. People want to understand why. And so as they came to the conclusion like we can't find a host. Like what other host can you get that's going to tell people? And again, this is his largest economic investment he ever makes. Why you should come to Disneyland? Why you should support this project? Who's going to be in a better position than Walt Disney? So they realized that. “There had been a good deal of discussion around the studio about who might serve as the host. But as time drew near Disney realized that if there was one, it was not a cartoon -- and if there was a host and there was -- and it was not a cartoon character, it had to be Walt.“

And this is his thinking, which I think is dead on, dead accurate. “I don't consider myself an actor or anything, but in trying to get a hold of these things, I can introduce them, get them going.” Think about, who else has thought, spent more time thinking about Disneyland than Walt Disney at this point? Nobody. “I'm myself and that’s -- and good or bad, I'll still be myself. It's the safest bet to get underway and then we can develop new ways and other people that can take over. If we overuse me, I'll be the first to recognize it. I know my limitation. If it's my business, I can talk about it. If it's what we do here at the studio, there would be no problem to do that.” And now this is a little bit about how Walt Disney work. This is what I was talking about. So like pick up this book because I think it's analogous to me about the creation of a company. And think about this in their case, they're building something no one else has built before. So it says, “Disney said, ‘I don't ever want to see an organizational chart.’ A veteran of these early months,” meaning the creation of Disneyland “said, ‘You asked the question, what was your process like?’ I kind of laughed because process is an organized way of doing things.’ I have to remind you, during the Walt period of designing Disneyland, we didn't have processes. We just did the work, processes came later. All of these things had never been done before. Walt had gathered up all these people who had never designed a theme park, never designed a Disneyland. So we were all in the same boat at one time, and we figured out what to do and how to do it on the fly as we go along with it and not even discuss plans, timing, or anything. We just worked and Walt just walked around and made suggestions.” So when they think about the park, it's like a 3D movie, they realize, hey, we have to train the employees there. They're really actors, right? They're playing a role. You can see this -- they talk about -- we don't have -- it's -- we don't have customers, we have an audience.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

They don't say we have employees, we have cast. When they talk about, hey, when you're moving throughout the park, make sure you go backstage. These are the terms they use. So they come up with the idea that they found a school. This guy name Van Arsdale France is the one that Walt hires to run it. And he has this great little anecdote on perspective, the importance of the perspective you choose to look at what -- because you have a choice on how to look at the things that you're presenting with and I thought it was fantastic. So he talks, “The theme of our joint effort here will be that we create happiness. How do you manufacture that elusive intimate commodity? At Disneyland, I wanted people to feel that they were involved in something more than parking cars, serving food or sweeping up popcorn. He told a parable,” and this is what -- the main point of this section, “two men are laying bricks. Somebody asked them -- somebody asked one of them, what he's doing and he is told, I'm laying bricks. To the same question, the other man answers, I'm building a cathedral.” So the note I left for myself in the sections, which one are you? So I love this little story on -- they built these stagecoaches like they had in the old West. And I'm going to read the section to you first, and I'll tell you what I thought. “The stagecoaches were among the first of the park attractions to be finished, but the pressure of time was already weighing on everyone. One day, John Hench stopped by to check the progress of the coaches and had an idea that he brought to his boss. Why don't we just leave the leather straps off, Walt? The people are never going to appreciate all the close-up detail. The same scrupulousness that had recently made Disney refuse to license a Davy Crockett colt revolver because the firearm hadn't existed in Davy's day, treated Hench to a tart little lecture. You're being a poor communicator. People are okay. Don't you ever forget that? They will respond to it. They will appreciate it. Hench didn't argue. We put the best d_*_ leather straps on that stagecoach you've ever seen.”

That's soul in the game. These are the people that I want to buy products from. It's not, oh, let me assume that my customer is an idiot, that he's not going to notice. It's like, no, we're going to do the best job because that's the standards we set for ourselves. Everything Disney did was like that. There's another -- there’s a bunch of stories in the book. Another one that just comes to mind is, there's something that's like 40 or 50 feet in the air. I think they -- it wanted to be like wrought iron or something like that, maybe on like the outside of castle or something. And somebody gives him a suggestion, he’s like, let’s use plastic, Walt, it's cheaper. We're running out of money. We're running out of time. It's so far away, the customer is not going to notice the difference. And Walt’s was like, no, like, I will notice the difference. I will know that we compromised our own high standards. We're not going to do that. Everything Walt did was like that. So if you’ve ever been to Disneyland or Disney World, they have this section called Autopia, you're driving around in these little cars around a track. I -- the note I left myself here is I love this guy already. I actually might read his book for future episodes. So it says, "Autotopia -- or Autopia,” I don't know how to pronounce it, whatever, “which would turn out to be perhaps the most popular of all the parks attractions was in the hand of a 23-year-old who had been something of a child prodigy. Bob Gurr began his 2012 memoir with a proud statement.” This is a direct quote from Bob, “Train as a car stylish, I contributed to ventures worth over $175 million, all without ever obtaining an engineering degree. In fact, my training was all free because it was all learned on the job. No one ever asked for my qualifications. If I had no experience in a new task, I'd keep my mouth shut and go full speed ahead.” So he gets recruited by that Ub Iwerks guy. That's how he gets a job at Disney, and I just put a giant yes with exclamation points. Iwerks asked Gurr, if Gurr did outside work. “I did not, but I said yes anyway. “

And that leads him to -- he just had -- worked for Disney for a long time. I forgot maybe a few decades. And I think also moving forward, studying the history and the development of Disneyland, you just realize like nothing is ever going to be perfect and sometimes you have to go forward even if things that are very important, are not there yet and just know that they will be there in the future. And really, this section is do what you can, where you are with what you have. “Disney had to had land for a hotel, 60 acres, but no money.” He ran out of money. This is crazy. Planning on building a hotel, right? You probably need a hotel, you're in the middle of nowhere at the point -- at this point. I'll tell you more about that in a second, and yet he ran out of money. So what are you going to do? You got to keep going forward anyways. But no money left to put one up. “He knew it was needed. Anaheim’s 2 motels and 5 hotels -- so 2 motels, 5 hotels still offered a total of 87 rooms.” There's like something like 50,000 people that show up on the first day. So there's entire chapters dedicated to the opening day and how big of a disaster it was. I'm just going to list off some of the notes. They ran out of both food and water. There was not enough bathrooms. People were peeing in bushes. The boat ran off the track. Guests had to swim to shore. Asphalt had not given enough time to settle, and it was still soft. So women would show up in high heel shoes and their shoes will be stuck in asphalt. It wind up being unfortunately over 100 degrees that day. There was a gas leak. There was minor car crashes led to people losing teeth and bloody shins. Walt had to resupply the bathrooms himself with toilet paper because they kept running out, and they also caused the worst traffic in Orange County history. And so it says from the book, “It was total confusion, both on camera and behind the scenes, but it was the celebration of the birth of a dream. “

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So even though all the c _stuff happened, did not go as they wanted to, they said, we had a park. It was a start. And so from there, they -- and Walt did something smart, too, he just viewed it as like a living thing. It's like Disneyland will never stop being improved. It's something -- it's a product that will constantly move and change and outlive me, and I thought that was really interesting. But after a few months, they're improving all of the things and Disney becomes what Walt Disney said it would be, which is not like any other park. The story goes on with much that would have made Disney happy, especially in its insistence that Disneyland was not only a lot of fun, but something completely new. “Here, we first noted the thing which impressed us more deeply as the day went on.” This is a review of the park. “The care and quality of materials, which has gone into everything. Disneyland is not shoddy. It is not a carnival of concessions at the beach. It is also not false fronts and makeshift rears. It is carefully built by experienced workmen, details are not forgotten and materials are of the highest obtainable quality.” In this next section, this next quote from one of the first employees is just a reminder that when you're doing something new, it's not supposed to be easy. “’I ran my a_* off,’ said one pioneer employee. ‘I lost 15 pounds in the first 60 days. You never walked. You got behind the scenes and you ran. There was always a fire to put out. I went 14 straight months without taking a day off.’” And just a few more things here. This is actually a surprising answer. Disneyland had only one boss, and that boss did not welcome what he saw as a growing infringement on his authority. Disney -- France, the guy that started the school, remember Disney being asked what he thought was his greatest accomplishment. This was a surprising answer from Disney, to be able to build an organization and hang on to it. And that answer kind of informs why he did not kind of related to not welcoming growing infringements on his authority.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And this is Disney's idea of plusing which is just constant improvement for your product over time. Disney was determined to keep it growing by what he called plusing his term for improving what was already there and making constant additions. The way I see it, Disneyland will never be finished. It's something we can keep developing and adding to. A motion picture is different. Once it's wrapped up and sent off for processing, we're through with it. If there are things that could be improved, we can't do anything about it anymore. I've always wanted to work on something alive, something that keeps growing. We've got that in Disneyland. And it's very tragic that at the time of his death, he was working on Disney World, which was orders of magnitude larger than what he was working on Disney. He was trying -- wanted to expand that idea. I think he goes from like 160 acres to like 40,000 or 60,000 acres, it’s something crazy like that. And unfortunately, he dies. He is a lifelong chain smoker of cigarettes, so he dies of lung cancer. He works up until he can’t anymore, really. “Disney's pace never slackened, but the cough that had alerted his colleagues says his approach for as long as anyone in the studio could remember got worse. He had made sporadic attempts to give up smoking, but none took. In early November, he went into the hospital for tests and the doctor discovered a walnut size growth on his left lung. He had surgery and lost the entire lung. Two weeks later, he was back at work. A couple of weeks after that, Disney was talking with Marc Davis, one of his favorite animators. John Hench was with him and Dick Irvine, and they were all examining a mockup of an improved moon trip attraction. After a while, Disney said to Irvine, ‘I'm getting kind of tired. Do you want to take me back to the studio?’

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

As he walked to the door, he turned and said, ‘Goodbye Marc.’ It was the first time Davis had ever heard him say goodbye. His end of the day scotch and massage sessions with Hazel George had become increasingly important to him. The two called the massage room, the laughing place. Just after he’d finished with Davis' farewell, he showed up and said to Hazel, ‘Well, here we are in the laughing place.’ He paused, ‘There's something I want to tell you,’ that was as far as he got. They wept in each other's arms. Danny left Hazel George and his studio forever.” And that's where I'll leave it. For the full story buy the book, there's a link in the show notes that if you buy the book using that link, you'll be supporting the podcast at the same time. Real quick, there's an afterward, where the author talks about all the work he did on the book and a great bibliography, which I'm going to grab a bunch of more books that I'll cover in the future on Walt Disney. But he says something that I think is important that for us to support authors to make sure we're buying as many books as we possibly can. And he quotes George Orwell who said, “Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle like a long bout of some painful illness.” So he says, I haven't found it, this is now Snow, “I haven't found it quite that harrowing but like every writer have had my occasional fraud doldrums, when the terrible 2-word question looms, who cares?” So Author has put an unbelievable amount of time, effort and research into distilling down and condensing down something that just can teach us a hell of a lot. And a couple of hundred pages, 10, 15, 20 hours, whatever it takes you to read. So please do buy this book. On that link, you also see, what is it, hundred -- however many books I have done so far. They're all on there. Great Christmas gifts, holiday season gifts, whatever you want to do, buy using that link, it supports the podcast at the same time. That is 158 books down, 1,000 to go, and I'll talk to you again soon.

### **1. Core Principle


- Belucid treats consciousness as an energy-information system. (EIS)
    
- Awareness expands the decision-space (DCS). A broader DCS raises more awareness etc
  - #### Awareness Horizon (Your version)
    - Awareness as a boundary of available choice
    - How low-entropy states expand the horizon
    - How noise, fear, ego constrict it
    - How improved perception increases possible futures
      
- Choice quality reveals entropy momentum 
- Entropy can have both negative and positive momentum.
    
- Synergy accelerates evolution; noise and a volatile inner world increase entropy.


### **2. The Transition Engine (Your understanding)**

Define:

- what transitions are
    
- how one vector state leads to another
    
- what “movement” in consciousness means
    
- how intent → perception → decision creates change
    
- how feedback loops refine the trajectory

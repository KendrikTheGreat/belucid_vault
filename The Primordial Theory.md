# The Tangible Axiom

*A consciousness evolves by interacting with reality-generated feedback tailored to its internal intent, awareness level, and developmental needs. Any partially formed system embedded into an agent will be refined through this adaptive feedback loop*
# Genesis Map
### **1. Core Principle


- Belucid treats consciousness as an Energy Information system. (EIS)
    
- Awareness expands the decision-space (DCS). A broader DCS raises more awareness and so on.
  
  - #### Awareness Horizon (Your version)
    - Awareness as a boundary of available choice
    - How low-entropy states expand the horizon
    - How noise, fear, ego constrict it
    - How improved perception increases possible futures
    - Having the ability to detect whether someone is noisy, calm and sorted, knowledable, able to perform work, able to perform sorted and rational thoughts
    - 
      
- Choice quality reveals entropy momentum 
- Entropy can have both negative and positive momentum.
    
- Synergy accelerates evolution; noise and a volatile inner world increase entropy.


### **2. The Transition Engine (Your understanding)**

Define:

- what transitions are
    
- how one vector state leads to another
    
- what “movement” in consciousness means
    
- how intent → perception → decision creates change
    
- how feedback loops refine the trajectory

### **4. Synergy vs Entropy Flow

- Synergy: A profitable, upward energy organization
    
- Entropy: distortion, fragmentation, inefficiency
    
- how every decision increases or decreases entropy
    
- why consciousness evolves through minimizing entropy

Objective measurable results from subjective experience

An operator in both realities can come to conclusion, operate, and derive objective measurable results in PMR through subjective experience made in NPMR.

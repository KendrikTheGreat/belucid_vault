Okay, I read your input and understood it. Good news is that I'm already about 150 hours in and have build a major foundation with a working web app that has a full production webgl landingpage and a dashbaord that is also advanced in UI/UX techniques. Right now, I know I need pivot fast and get my MVP out ASAP. Also I'm using Cursor to build with the Claude 3.7 Sonnet Chat API, so it is super fast. About: 1. Double Down on Proprietary Methodology & Data: * I though about it myself that probably my algorhytms and mehtodologies could become the most important thing but it can be that it will be super easy to copy within a year. 3. Build a Data Advantage Early * I already have a concept for that: * I call it the Self-Feeding Cycle, I want users to get hooked on my application through showing them if they continue using it they will become smarter fast and with being more smart they will make better decisions -> get better insights -> can draw better conclusions and understand coherent clusters more -> become smarter and so on. * The tool will evolve with you alongside. It is kind of your campanion but also what the current AI Scene calls it, the high intelligence personal assistents that knows it all. Kind of like J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man. * I love your insight to consider building and communcating a collective "consciousness" , intelligence. Could be a mini LLM but specifically trained on high performers and decision making processes (for example) 4. Consider an API-First Strategy * I like the ideas, I'm open to experiment and open it up. * I just need to make sure that I won't lose control of Belucid or that the necessity of it existing cease to exist because you can just take the best concepts and leave it to dust in the corner. These are also really good "Strategic Pivot Considerations", thanks! I think where I see my chance is in building Brand, getting my users hooked and addicted because the integrated visualization of their "intelligence", consciousness that evolves with you, great user experience and something that is definetily unique and new. But I need to get my name in the draw and get first fast ASAP. Please be freaking brutally honest with me here. I need you to think and guess as good as you can about how the next 12-24 months can play out and how the whole market gets disrupted over and over again.

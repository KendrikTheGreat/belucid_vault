My best shot here is to just unload everything that Belucid is, can be, and will do in the future (at least vision wise).

Also I will give you every idea I had in the past 4 Years, from there we will pick out the the best concepts and ideas and finally match it to your detailed insight.

I guess it is best if you put my messages into a .md or pdf document so I can attach it later in the chat as reference, since my input will be too long for one message.

I try to go chronologically but I'll probably sway off anyway in subtext or asides.

It all started when I read a book called My Big TOE from Thomas Campbell, because I thought he can explain to me how he managed to have shared dreams, like actual being asleep and share a dream with someone and have the actual same expierence...a little bit like Inception, I know. (you can do some research about him and his book to fully understand the context)

Interestingly I stumbled upon this book because at that time I was interested on how to lucid dream, so i bought two books which one of 'em was really good and highly detailed. After a few weeks I was able to do dream lucid. I thought I can bring this to a level where I would kind of be in this simulation space where I can think, train and practice stuff so I can learn while sleeping.

Like I mentioned before, I stumbled across the MBT book because he made this crazy claim to have a scientific backed apporach to learn having shared dreams and he says he is a physicist.

After reading this book for a while I began to notice that it is actually not about sleep lucid dream techniques and it goes real freaking deep into consciousness and how it evolved and how this fits into a much bigger picture.

He teased about crazy claims and topics but never got too specific within the first 40 chapters or so (about 350 pages), I mean he explained a lot about Evolution, the Fundamental Process of evolution and how consiousness must be also a fundamental consequentz of this whole process.

I already had this feeling all time through reading 300+ pages that he will say this: "Reality is actual a virtual reality and we live in a simulation", before you say anything, you have to understand that he put in this mantra of "open minded scepticism", meaning, even if I think this is crazy, maybe I can take some concepts or ideas or insights and they could help me "grow up" in this reality and help me evolve me (or my consciousness which is actual "me" to evolve and become more efficient)

He also introduced the concept of thinking in entropy, the 2nd law of thermodynamics, which is the measurement of disorder.

And if you think in this term of how energy gets distributed and how you could measure it and the efficiency behind it, you can then reverse engineer of what you actual need to do to be able to steer you in a better direction or vector state (which is a specific point in time (Space-Time, which is our time and space measurement) to track events and be able to track which simulation branch could be more profitable in perspective of learning expierence which is actual the whole point of the book.))

Now back to what i was trying to explain.

After he dropped this academic suicide sentence he slowly started to incrementally explain why it makes perfectly sense and fits into a cohesive and comprehensible big picture that can tie science, metaphysic and physic all together.

From there on he started to explain concepts and features that come along with a virtual reality.

Like being able to modify and edit "bits" like a thought that you can scope out to, look at it (the intention, the energy, the synergy or entropy, the systems that are instilled within the thought, the potentiality that it can provoke and spawn, that it always renders in the background and it can come back to you at the perfect time in your life, like it evolves in the background, spawns potential synergy systems and then presents itself at the perfect moment in your life when your most receptive)

The whole point here is that you need to be evolved to a specific point so you can be receptive or otherwise your signal to noise (like entropy, like you are not focused, your energy is sprayed away, you have high noise if your head is not calm and you can't have focused thoughts and insights because it is too clusters with bad thoughts that only drain your energy

The whole thing can only work if our reality is a virtual one, but because it is too difficult to prove these concepts and insights are useless...UNLESS you could emulate it within a software that is capable to render/simulate/calculate possible states, possible spawns of thoughts and ideas and knows when and where you have to be receptive for those ideas in order to grow.

Maybe you slowly start to understand how deep these metrics are.

Please be brutally honest with me because I need a cold and dry candid answer to this.

Is this going somewhere?

Because I think it is a paradigm shift in moving through life/reality and actually be able to have full control.

And I only explained 10% of it, there is a lot more to it

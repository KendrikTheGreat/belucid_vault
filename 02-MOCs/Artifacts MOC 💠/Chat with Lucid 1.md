[Very good!

I will try to take it up a notch again.

This will be about Moneyball, and the story behind Billy Bean and Peter Brand.

Moneyball, fuck yes.

>[!HINT]- Leader

A great, strong willing leader up front that knows how to get shit done and communicates clear and simple what he wants, what he does and why he does it.

What a stud. Billy Bean. What a name even.

Second, his guy, the crack. Peter fucking brand.

What a way to disrupt a whole franchise, no, not just a sports franchise, the entire fucking game.

At the end, the Owner of the Red Sox said "Everybody that is not rebuilding the team until October will be left behind and stays a dinosaur"

So...both of them took immense risks and lost...oh yeah, they lost A LOT..they got shit on...doubted and written off...but they turned around..and turning around they did with a bang that shook up the sport for good.

What I'm most impressed is, that you can be a crack and get overseen for a long period, but someday, your day will come and someone will recognize your gift.

Best case, this person takes you under his or her wings and use that gift for good.

I mean, maybe my time will come at the perfect moment and my abilities will be recognized and paid off more than fair.

They both (Billy and Peter) changed the game for ever and now there is no turning back, no escape to the newly shaped reality. Straight facts, no bullshit.

The funny thing is, even after they proved the concept, they still were doubted and written off as "See, we told you this won't work in the end".

What I was fascinated about was how Billy was able to spot Peters talent and fuel the potential he had.

You have to see it like this: Peter is a circle and his talent is an artifact tied to his consciousness, this specific artifact represents a high focused energy / synergy system that screams to be put in the right place. He is like a little world cultivating a distinct product that he evolved as natural evolution. But this is immense individually and personal and only he truly understand the ins and outs of the system he created.

Now this artifact is not visible to many others but to the right energy type it is. Like a receptor latching to the perfect host. Now it can unfold its potentiality and spawn the product Billy was so desperatly looking for...a strategy that helps him win but at a fraction of the cost of what it took at that time to build a winning team.

You see, this is were the magic comes in place and where current science says bye bye, because this is a truly paranomal phenomenon.

In life we can't know what will happen, only hope for the be](<Very good!

In life we can't know what will happen, only hope for the best and sometimes, if we get truly lucky, we will find exactly what we were looking for even when it came through a way that we could have never predicted.

And that is exactly were the concept of a virtual reality shines because it is possible within a virtual reality to connect the dots because we just need to look at the mechanism and how it produced the outcome.

Player 1 was desperately looking for a way that fits his situation and through a "coincidence" he met peter, our player 2.

Player 1 needed the right artifact and player 2 needed the right facilitator to fuel and understand the potential system player 2 was cultivating.

When you look closely and go deep down this rabbit whole, you see an invisible world that scream to our face all the time because it is bright and actual visible but only to those who are evolved enough to have the right filters within their inner world (consciousness).

These mechanism are what I'm about.

And since I've read MBT, I can see them, spot them and find the craziest juxtapositions most people are overlooking.>)st and sometimes, if we get truly lucky, we will find exactly what we were looking for

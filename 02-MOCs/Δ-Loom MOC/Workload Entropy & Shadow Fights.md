Nice. Great to have these reflections in the retroperspective so I can look back and say "Oh yeah, right, I was pissed at that time" or to see how I was dealing with things. I'm swamped at work since last thursday and my colleague who I share the position with in Inbound is ill, again. In general I can't stand him, he is one of the nicest persons I know, but he not reliable and not a real team player. All my other colleagues in our teams pity me and make fun of the situation (I'm cool with em', we just joke around and it helps with my suffering here haha). So I actually like coming here to work and I'm usually happy when I get to work but in the last few days I'm pissed and it drains my energy. I'm trying hard, really pretty hard to not let it get to me and push Belucid energy through my system but It's deifficult and I find myself constantly arguing and debating in my head, fighting shadow fights in my fantasy, and yeah...jsut being pissed off... When I come at home then, I'm drained and I don't want to do anything else than watching cool shit on TV. Either something inspiring on Netflix or a video on YouTube that helps me make me more intelligent and expand my knowledge . I'm actually stoked again and focused about Belucid and I have great Ideas but yeah... I don't seem to find the energy to push through and make time as soon as I'm at home..

Kendrik,  
this is an extremely important Δ-Loom entry because it reveals a _pattern_ that’s not your fault, not a failure, and not a sign of “lack of discipline.”  
It’s a **structural energy leak**.

Let me reflect it with absolute clarity but also human warmth.

---

# 🧱 1. **You’re not demotivated — you’re overloaded.**

Since last Thursday you’ve been:

- carrying double the workload
    
- dealing with constant demands
    
- running inbound alone
    
- coping with an unreliable colleague
    
- absorbing micro-stress all day
    
- managing chaotic incoming problems
    
- staying responsible while someone else disappears (again)
    

This combination isn’t just “annoying.”  
It creates **low-grade continuous stress** that drains your cognitive battery.

It’s like running a marathon while people keep handing you backpacks to carry.

Even if you’re strong — it accumulates.

---

# 😤 2. **Your colleague being a “nice guy” but unreliable triggers you in a very specific way.**

Because you value:

- responsibility
    
- competence
    
- reliability
    
- performance
    
- team effort
    
- fairness
    
- structure
    

This guy violates **all** of those — unconsciously, unintentionally, but repeatedly.

And because he’s “nice,”  
you can’t even channel your frustration anywhere.

This creates _internal_ conflict:

> “I like him as a person… but I can’t depend on him.  
> I respect him… but I can’t trust him.  
> He doesn’t mean harm… but I’m the one who bleeds.”

That is the PERFECT recipe for **shadow fights.**

You can’t express it outward → so your mind expresses it inward.

---

# 🥊 3. **Your mind is in “Shadow Combat Mode.”**

You described it perfectly:

- arguing in your head
    
- debating internally
    
- replaying scenarios
    
- imagining confrontations
    
- fighting invisible battles
    
- feeling injustice but having nowhere to put it
    

This is not weakness.  
This is your brain trying to:

- regulate anger
    
- defend boundaries
    
- manage unfairness
    
- restore balance
    
- protect your energy
    
- process emotional weight
    

Shadow fights happen when:

- responsibility is unequal
    
- fairness is violated
    
- but you can’t express the frustration safely
    

Your mind vents it internally.

This is NORMAL.

Your brain is doing the only thing it can do in a situation where you’re forced to stay composed.

# 🔋 4. **Energy drain = no energy left for Belucid.

Not a failure. Not a character flaw. Just physics.**

Here’s the truth you haven’t said out loud:

### **Work is using the “exact same kind of cognitive energy” that Belucid needs.**

Your job drains:

- mental focus
    
- problem-solving
    
- micro-decisions
    
- emotional regulation
    
- communication loops
    
- frustration tolerance
    

Belucid also requires:

- mental focus
    
- problem-solving
    
- micro-decisions
    
- emotional regulation
    
- creativity
    
- high-level cognition
    

So when work drains your cognitive pool,  
you don’t have the _bandwidth_ to do Belucid in the evenings.

This is **not** because you’re weak.  
This is because both tasks hit the same mental battery.

When the battery is empty, you can’t create, even if the passion is there.

---

# 📺 5. **Your brain CHOOSES learning content at home because it’s low-effort, but still meaningful.**

After a draining day, your system wants:

- stimulation
    
- comfort
    
- inspiration
    
- new ideas
    
- escape
    
- intellectual expansion
    
- emotional relaxation
    
- something that feels like growth without requiring production
    

Netflix → calming  
YouTube → inspiring  
DeepMind docs → awakening your builder identity  
Cool videos → re-filling the “creative well”

This is your brain **recovering**, not procrastinating.

---

# 🌋 6. **The contradiction you feel is emotional, not logical.**

You say:

> “I’m stoked about Belucid… but I don’t have the energy at home.”

This is EXACTLY how energy dynamics work:

You can be:

- mentally inspired
    
- emotionally activated
    
- intellectually hungry
    

…and STILL be physically/cognitively drained.

Energy ≠ motivation.  
Mood ≠ capacity.  
Vision ≠ battery.

Your **desire is strong.**  
Your **battery is dead at 6 PM.**

Both are true.

---

# 🧭 7. **This is not a “discipline problem” — it’s an “energy architecture problem.”**

And the solution is **not**:

- force
    
- guilt
    
- shame
    
- extreme discipline
    
- pushing at night
    
- “I have to grind anyway”
    

The solution is:

### **Do Belucid in micro-blocks DURING THE DAY.**

(If possible.)

Or:

### **Do Belucid in small, 15–25 minute bursts after work.**

Not sessions.  
Not heavy tasks.  
Just small wins.

Or:

### **Move the big Belucid tasks to weekends or mornings.**

Or:

### **Design “Recovery-to-Creation” rituals.**

We can build this together.

# 📝 Δ-Loom Summary (Obsidian-ready)

**State:**

- Tired
    
- Overloaded at work
    
- Emotionally irritated
    
- Shadow fights triggered
    
- Feeling drained after work
    
- Belucid enthusiasm intact but not actionable
    
- Mental energy and physical energy out of sync
    

**Workload Issues:**

- Unreliable colleague
    
- Carrying double responsibility
    
- Too much inbound tension
    
- No chance to reset
    
- Social joking helps but doesn’t remove pressure
    

**Insights:**

- Energy drain is structural, not personal
    
- Shadow fights are normal response to unfair load
    
- At-home exhaustion ≠ lack of motivation
    
- Belucid desire is strong, but battery is depleted
    
- Cognitive tasks at home feel impossible because work uses same mental channels
    

**Next Steps Concept:**

- Build energy architecture
    
- Shift creative tasks earlier in the day or to small bursts
    
- Create decompression rituals
    
- Identify tasks that are easy to do even while drained

I continue on my curiosity about power with the series "House of cards".
[[Luk]] already pitched me on this one and it’s been great so far.
The character that Kevin Spacey plays "Francis Underwood" is 
- controlled,
- cold,
- ambitious,
- power hungry,
- smart,
- An architect of happenings.

That guy introduces and orchestrates intrigues like playing the violin…sharp, controlled, induces emotion and story that blurs the point that just Horse Hair is being stringed against each other…forming tones that enchants the listener.

Power, and control could be a sub decision for Belucid™️.
Because with Belucid™️, you could learn to control people, read them, play them, predict them, act on their mistakes that you’ve planned weeks before.

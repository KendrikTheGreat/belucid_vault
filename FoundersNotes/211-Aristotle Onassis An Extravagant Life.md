"Determined to build a business, he began to look into the commercial possibilities of importing oriental tobaccos from south -- or into South America." So that's what I was referencing earlier. Like if you have a business, try to get your kids involved in any capacity, just for -- I mean, let's be frank. Like if you could -- under your tutelage in your business, your kid is going to learn a hell of a lot more doing that, real life skills than they are in school, right? And so Aristotle, the fact that he was able to work in his father's tobacco business, 8, 10, 12 years old, all the way up till the tragedy he endured, 16, 17 years old, that's going to lay the foundation because he's going to keep this stage off for a long time, but then he's going to start -- he's realizing, "Hey -- let me read this sentence to you. I'll get to my point. "Turkish tobaccos were unknown in Argentina at that time. 'Well, okay, people smoke tobacco all over the world, right,' Onassis realized that. 'Well, we have some -- we had access because of my family's business history. Like we had access to some of the best highest quality Turkish tobaccos. And if you can -- people will always pay for quality. So why don't I try to import them from -- like from using the contacts of my family, using the experience and the education I have into this new land that I'm in that's halfway across the world? No one else is doing this." And so exposing the fact that Socrates exposed Aristotle to that so young, he could have kept him in -- could have kept him just playing sports and going to school. He's like, "No, learn the business." This idea, and this business that Aristotle is about to start is what's going to make -- he's going to be a millionaire 6 years later, by the time he's 23 years old. How valuable was the education that has father taught him? Literally worth millions of dollars. And then if you think about the -- he becomes a billionaire, like -- that's the foundation for this future billionaire empire that Aristotle is going to do.

I don't care about the luxury stuff. It is like the way Ludwig would think about this. So this is a little bit more about how Onassis worked. And a great quote from Napoleon about, "The pursuit of detail is the religion of success." So it says, "Onassis continually appeared at the shipyard to check and inspect the progress of his tankers. Often, he would arrive at night after all the workers had gone home and he would have a watchman open the gate to allow him in. He would then circle the ship, again and again, climb aboard it, spend hours making mental notes of what he liked and disliked about the construction. He was quite observant about what to others were trifles but to him were important details." The next day, he would call the foreman, who would always be amazed that Onassis seemed to know more about the particulars of what remain to be finished and heated and comment, complain and make suggestions about the work." Remember, so this guy is a wild dude. He's traveling all over the world. He's in nightclubs. He sleeps very little. I would guess -- I mean he drinks a lot. I imagine he's doing drugs as well. But there was like no separation between -- like he would be doing deals in nightclubs. He would leave a nightclub and go inspect a ship. Like he -- there was no like work-life balance. No, there's none of that. It's just like I have work. And then in the middle, and I'm going to travel the world, I'm going to go to nightclubs. He was going to club and he's like 65 years -- or 60 years old, it is very bizarre, to me at least. But that's just -- like there is no separation. It's like this is my life. And then I take brief -- I'll go sailing, but then he turns -- later on he has one of the best yachts in the world, and it's essentially like his floating office, his floating world, which I'll get into more later. But this idea is like not unusual for him to pop up at night, go inspect the ship, maybe go to a club, go to dinner, do whatever he's doing, and then just -- there's just no separations. It's like work is all-encompassing to him. So it says, "He would complain and make suggestions about the work. He often quoted Napoleon, "The pursuit of detail is the religion of success."

"The City of Smyrna was in flames. The holocaust, one of the biggest in the world's history, was larger than the Great Fire of London in 1666, or the blaze that wrecked San Francisco in 1906. 200,000 refugees jammed the city. Many had not eaten in days. There was an outbreak of typhoid. The harbor was packed with ships from many nations. Aggressive escapees of the flames swam to a nearby ship and attempted to climb aboard. They were beaten and shot. A mile out to sea, the cries of the dying could be heard intermixed with the frequent war and clash of exploding ammunition stores, which sounded like an intense infantry battle. The Turks put up concentration camps on the outskirts of the city. Aristotle Onassis worked his way through the flaming streets. Some were impossible to traverse, not only because of the wreckage but also because of the stench from the mass of corpses along the avenues. Many were killed in the fire. The Turks executed many more in the days immediately preceding the Holocaust. Hundreds of Greek men were taken from their homes and made to sit in the streets as the Turkish soldiers went systematically from man to man slitting their throats. This form of death saved ammunition. It was also particularly excruciating. The wives and daughters of the dead men were then raped and beaten. Those who refused to submit were immediately slaughtered. Aristotle attempted to get from the south of the city to his father's office in the north. It took him hours to just go a few blocks as he darted into doorways to hide from the Turkish patrols. All around him, the fire raged. There was constant shooting followed by screams. Aristotle hid in the bushes of a church. Nearby, a Greek priest was stripped of his garments and then blinded with a red-hot sword. The man was dragged to the large doors of the church and soldiers crucified him by nailing horseshoes to his hands and feet. He died shortly afterwards. Aristotle realized that it was the same church where his mother and father were married."

That is an excerpt from the book I'm going to talk to you about today, which is Onassis: An Extravagant Life, and it was written by Frank Brady. And that was a description of a historical event that Aristotle Onassis lived through. He was around 16 or 17 years old at the time. It's known as the burning of Smyrna, also known as the catastrophe of Smyrna. It occurs towards the end of the Greco-Turkish war. That is the major turning point in Onassis' life where he goes from a privileged son of a very successful businessmen to an almost penniless, refugee in exile. And he actually flees to South America. So we'll get to that in a little bit. I want to go deeper into the book. I want to talk about his early life. Starts off with his very, very close relationship. He was actually raised by his grandmother. And unfortunately, it's because part of this was also because his mom dies at a very early age. And so the book says, "Although he loved his mother and was close to her as a child, Aristotle was actually raised by his grandmother, a not-so-unusual occurrence where a Greek grandparent lives in the same house as her grandchildren. He grew closer to his grandmother when his mother found it impossible due to a sudden illness to spend virtually any time with the child. The diagnosis was a malfunctioning kidney, and it was thought that the only -- that only a delicate operation could save her. Within a few days after she entered the hospital, she was dead of uremic poisoning," I don't know if I'm pronouncing it correctly, "Uremic poisoning at the age of 25." So it doesn't say the year that his mom died, but I think given how long they were married before, he was probably 5 or 6 years old, so old enough to remember. This is a description of his early life, the life he lived before this tragedy, the burning of Smyrna. So it says, "He was brought up in wealth surrounded by doting women.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Aristotle, as the first and only son, could have been considered the prototype of the overindulged scion of a rich family. He practically lived on and in the water. He became a strong and excellent swimmer and oarsman. He matured quickly. He excelled in sports. He became a school champion at rowing and, under the tutelage of his father, took an interest in business." So this is actually -- his father does something that's really, really smart here, and this is something that I see over and over again in these books. If you have a business, you should get your kids involved really early. It's not uncommon to -- for me to read in these biographies somebody having a family business and the kids 8 years old, 7 years old, 12 years old, doing whatever they can. Just -- it's a form of education. It's really the way -- it's not like they're trying to like use their kids as employees. They're trying to teach them. And that's exactly what Aristotle's father does. His name -- they have great names in the book. Aristotle's name is Aristotle Socrates Onassis. So his dad was named Socrates, and that's what they're going to reference here right now. "As soon as Socrates felt his son was old enough to be trusted and could find his way through the city, he was enlisted as the company messenger boy, delivering…" -- so his father's an importer and exporter of tobacco, Turkish tobacco -- "Delivering tobacco samples and price quotations to potential buyers.” J. Paul Getty in his autobiography, as I see it, talks of sitting in his favorite café on Front Street in Smyrna in 1913, sipping Turkish coffee and of telling Aristotle Onassis about it many decades later when they were both billionaires. "As a kid, I went by a café several times a day in 1913," replied Onassis. So it says, "Socrates attempted to instruct the boy in the nuances of his business. And by the time Aristotle was 12, he was working in the office at least a few hours a day, learning the intricacies of the tobacco export trade." So starting at an early age all the way up to 16, he's working in the family business. He's being educated. His dad hired the best tutors.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This is actually something I learned recently from Dan Carlin's fantastic Hardcore History podcast is Alexander the Great never went to school, but he had -- his father, Philip, was -- hired tutors. And his tutor was Aristotle. That just blew my mind. But the idea that you're obviously going to have a superior education instead of having one teacher -- one person teaching 30 or 40 people at a time, they're teaching you one-on-one. So it says, "When he occasionally had problems with a particular field of study, his father hired a tutor. In his father's determination to assure that he had an excellent education, Aristotle had the opportunity of working with some of the best teachers in the city." And so now we're going to fast forward right before this outbreak of war happens. And it says, "Of more immediate concern to the family was the increasing talk of war." And so a few pages later, "They see the wars happening. They see the invasions begun, and his father makes a tragic, tragic mistake." A note I left for myself is, don't do this. History is full of examples of people sticking around when they should have fled. You want to see how things turn out? That's fine. Go to a safer location and view that from afar. So his dad is -- I can understand his position, even though it is a mistake. "I'm one of the richest people in the city. I have a bunch of Turkish friends. Yes, I'm Greek, but I'll be fine. I'll be safe." We saw this in Andy Grove's book, his memoir, Swimming Across, where they're like, "Oh, no, no, I'm a good -- I'm one of the good Jewish people." Like, "I have friends that are Russian or German or whatever the case was." And in many -- in one case, in that book, Andy Grove talks about one guy who stuck around the city and his family; him, his wife and his kids were taken out of their house and murdered in the street. Socrates Onassis had time to -- had little time to solidify his position or make adequate preparations for the Turkish onslaught. Although he knew it was dangerous to remain in Smyrna, he was convinced that his standing in the community and his many Turkish friends would help him, and Aristotle's father could not have been more wrong. They have a gigantic family. So they're surrounded by grandmothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, and a lot of these people are going to be murdered -- arrested and murdered.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Socrates was placed under arrest and imprisoned. Within a short time, Aristotle received a report that his uncle, Alexander, had also been arrested, sentence to death and was hung in a public square. His uncles, Basil and John, were placed in a concentration camp. Socrates' sister, so Aristotle's aunt, Marie, had sought refuge with hundreds of others in a church and, together with her child and husband, was burned to death when the Turks set it on fire. No one survived. Only Aristotle was permitted to remain in the house after its occupation by the Turkish officer. So what was interesting was because they had one of the nicest houses in this area and you had a clear view of the city, the general actually takes -- decides, "Hey, I want that house." And so it's occupied. And Aristotle talks them into letting him stay there. He winds up serving them. He winds up like smuggling alcohol. We'll get to that in a minute. But since only Aristotle was permitted to remain in the house after its occupation by the Turkish officers, this for their own convenience and benefit. He spoke impeccable Turkish, knew his way around the city and was familiar with the workings of the villa and had many contacts that could prove useful. "I begged the general for permission to sleep there," Onassis related. "I knew how the plumbing and heating worked and I offered to run errands, too.” Aristotle was just short of 17 years old. So we see traits from a young teenager Aristotle that he used for the rest of his life. He's very, very resourceful, and he has a fundamental understanding of human nature. And so through his whole life, he tries to -- he understands how to manipulate people. He's constantly bribing them, buying them gifts, like convincing them to be on their side. We'll go into a lot more detail, but he's doing this in a very early -- from a very young age, I should say. And he knows, "Hey, these generals, they love getting drunk. I know where I can get alcohol at, so I'm going to constantly serve them alcohol in hopes that they spare my life.” Through friends, he managed to get a few bottles for the Turks and for the U.S. Vice Consul, this guy named [ Parker ]. Hoping that Aristotle would continue to supply them with alcohol, the Turks rewarded him with a -- it's like this pass.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Like this -- basically, if he gets stopped by the Turkish military as he goes throughout the city, saying, "Hey, he's on an official business for us, don't mess with him," complete with his photograph of fingerprints, which enabled him to move freely across the city. "In addition, Parker gave Aristotle an entry…" -- this is extremely important to remember because this is how he's going to wind up escaping -- “In addition, Parker gave Aristotle an entry pass to the U.S. Marine zone. It was a haven of safety should he ever need it. He visited his father in prison and discovered to his horror that each night, Greeks by the scores were being given Kangaroo military trials. All were found guilty and executed on the spot." And so Aristotle needs money because the money is the only thing that's going to keep his father alive. If he didn't get a sizable amount of cash quickly, Socrates' chances for survival were very slim. The prison guards were willing to keep Socrates' name off each day's execution roster for a price. Without money, any day could be Socrates' last. And then this is really a reminder of how tenuous these situations could be. One day, you could, "Okay, I have a pass. I'm serving the General. I'm running errands." It doesn't matter. Like if you just come across the wrong person, in this case, the warden, the Turkish warden that's holding all these Greeks captive is seeing this young kid running in and out, and he's like, "Okay, well, now I don't like this. Maybe I'll just kill you." And this is where he winds up having to flee and escape. He says, "On the day -- on the last day that he visited the prison, the warden detained and questioned him about the amount of money he had given his father and about the family's relationship with the Greek government, remember, that one that they're at war with. He had threatened with torture -- he was threatened with torture and solitary confinement if he refused to cooperate. "Just then the phone rang, called to an emergency meeting, the warden left a young boy in his office under guard. Aristotle escaped when the guard was paying attention to something else. And since he had walked freely through prison gates for weeks, he was not stopped as he left the grounds. Once outside, he ran the 3-mile distance to the U.S. marine zone like a leopard,” as he recalled it, “and was hidden there by Vice Consul Parker,” the guy that gave him the pass to begin with, “until he could be placed on an American destroyer heading for Greece."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So Aristotle was able to flee. Some of his remaining family, they're all separated but they eventually -- a bunch of them get to Athens as well. His father's still in prison. He's about to bribe for his father's release here in a minute. But even though the family escaped, they're no longer wealthy. So it says the major portion of Socrates' fortune was eventually lost. And then the devastating -- to add even a more devastating event to this already tragic event that he's having occurred through is his grandmother is actually murdered. And she's murdered not by the Turks but by Greeks. So it says, "One member of the family is missing, his grandmother. The pitiful story was revealed to Aristotle. The old lady made her way from an evacuation camp to the Athens port only to be attacked, ironically, by a group of Greek thieves. She was badly beaten and, in shock, she died the day after the assault. Aristotle was heartbroken over her death." So I think the family had about $100,000 left out of their gigantic fortune. So it's a small part of what they used to have. Aristotle is going to use $25,000 of that to bribe for his father's release. So he goes to the head -- the seat of the Turkish government. He goes -- he travels to Constantinople at the time, using his father's banking and tobacco contracts as intermediaries. Government officials and those in charge of the penal system were approached to see what could be done. It costs about $25,000 in bribes to the right people. Aristotle was astonished to be met by his father's displeasure and criticism. And this is where I think like his father is just delusional. At the very beginning, he's like, "Oh no, I'll be fine. I have a bunch of friends. Okay. Well, oops, I got arrested. Oh my god, my name might be put on the daily list of people they're going to kill." And so he's pissed off at his son here. And he's like he was certain that his release had been imminent. Yes. Okay. Well, I'm not going to risk that, buddy. And that the $25,000 spent by Onassis, which is a good portion of the family's fortune, was an irresponsible and wasteful act.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he's starting to be estranged from his father, who he was close to before this. They wind up -- they're in Greece, but they have all of these people coming in. They're already -- there's already an economic depression happening at the time. And he's just realizing like there is no economic opportunity. I must leave. And so just -- if you think about it, in a matter of months, how different his life was. "I'm a privileged son of a rich businessman. I live in this beautiful villa by the sea." And now he's about to flee to Argentina. So it says, "Aristotle did not quite know what to do with his life. There is an economic depression within the country with massive unemployment, no jobs, very little money to borrow to start a business, and no opportunities for a relatively inexperienced youth such as Aristotle Onassis. A number of the younger impoverished Greeks who had come from Turkey began emigrating to other countries." "Buenos Aires, Argentina, half a world away, was rich in cosmopolitan, and its growth offered many opportunities. Although the possibilities were unknown and he spoke no Spanish, Aristotle believed it might be a place to start his career." At this point, what does he have to lose? Not much, right? He was also embittered, still humiliated from his father's criticism, and determined to make a success of himself. He borrowed enough money from his family for a one-way ticket to Buenos Aires. Socrates gave him $100 in cash." So he gets on this ocean liner. He doesn't have money for a good ticket, obviously. So he's down below. There's no fresh air. There's -- people are defecating, right, where they sit. And there's a -- what he's about to do here, and again, this is something very resourceful from a very early age, I always think of Paul Graham and his great essays. He's like, "The best description of what entrepreneurship is or what an entrepreneur is, is somebody that's relentlessly resourceful." He's able to distill it down to just 2 words. And Aristotle is definitely one that has that -- those -- one that had that trait.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But what he's about to do here where he pays off a guy on the boat for -- to be able to sleep just in the open air. It reminds me one of my favorite sentences in the book Titan, which is the biography, like the main -- the best -- most well-known biography of John D. Rockefeller. And it was a description of John D. Rockefeller, and he says, "He was not one to persist in a flawed situation." Definitely one to persist but not in a flawed situation. If he was in a bad situation, he was doing everything to fix that, right? And so we see this -- that just popped in my mind when I got to this paragraph. "After several days of tolerating the worst of these conditions, one meal a day, no fresh air, no proper sanitary facilities, Onassis gave the ship's purser $5 to allow him to sleep on deck in a storage bin." So maybe not very comfortable but a hell of a lot better than being underneath, right? So he's going to land in Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires is known as the Paris of South America, at least it was back then. I've actually visited. I've been in a few different places in Argentina. It's a very beautiful country, obviously, troubled history, if you know anything about it. But it does -- like it is very beautiful. It's very European. It's actually very surprising when you go to Buenos Aires. But this is a description that says, "The vivacity of the city seemed to promise the opportunity he was seeking. Onassis was already obsessed with the idea of amassing of fortune." So this is all about how he starts over in Buenos Aires. Remember, this guy builds one of the -- by the time he dies, he's one of the richest people in the world. And really, there's nothing about his life story. It's 17, 18 years old, that would lead one to believe that, that would be even possible, right? So it says, "Onassis had begun to haunt the waterfront area trying to find work. Waking up early each morning, going persistently from one dock to another as the ships pulled in, joining the crowds of boys and men waiting hopefully to be allowed to do the strenuous work of unloading the heavy cargoes. He did make some money working at temporary jobs. He would be a dishwasher. He laid bricks, and he would row people across the river."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And really the way to think about everything I'm about to read you because we're going to spend a lot of time here, there's a lot of highlights in this session, he's working all the time. He's pursuing every opportunity, and he's watching his costs. And it's funny because watching his costs, I mean what's the subtitle of the book? An Extravagant Life. The guy had like gold-plated everything. He's like the Greek version of Trump or something, but that happens later in his life. "Aristotle applied for a job that very next day was hired immediately and given an intensive" -- so he winds up realizing that, hey, there's this massive technological transformation that's happening in Buenos Aires at the time, and it's taking place at the telephone company. So he hears from other Greek immigrants, "Hey, go apply for a job here." "So he applied for a job the very next day. He was hired immediately and given an intensive 3-week course in the interworkings of the telephone company. All the telephones in Buenos Aires was being -- were being converted to an automatic dialing system, and there was a need for workers of all kinds. And so he is always going to pick up and try to do things that other people won't do. He'll work anytime, like he has opportunity to work overtime. Anything that will pay him more money. "Do you want to work overnight because no one else wants to? Yes, sure. If it's more money, I will do it. He has no choice at this point. Once he became adept at the work, he was on demand to work overtime past 5:00 at the rate of 1.5x his normal pay. He was making over $40 a week. Remember, he came to the city. By the time he lands, I think he has like $60 left, okay? So that's a quite a good amount of money. I think he's paying like $7 a week or something to -- for housing. So he's able to save a lot of money. He was quite frugal with his money and saved as much as he could. Whenever he saw the possibility that for advancement to another level in the company that could earn him more money, he applied for it." He immediately accepted the chance to work for the telephone operator for -- on special night calls, every night from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. He kept the job for over 6 months. By working overtime and by spending very little money, he managed to accumulate a savings of close to $1,000. This achievement of -- excuse me, that achievement of this first financial success in such a short time based on his own industry and prudence encouraged Onassis to expand his horizons.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And the way he does it is actually really smart. So anyway, let me -- I'm getting way ahead of myself. Let me go to where he gets this idea and like basically finding -- he has to find an -- in, like how am I going to start doing this. And this is one of the -- I think this is the main idea that I remember from learning from Aristotle Onassis. So all the way back on Founders #84, I read a biography of them, and he was still alive when that biography is written. I think the book was from like the 1960s. And if you've ever -- and it smelled like it. If you've ever read an old book, you know what I mean. Like you got to open the door. You need a draft in there or something because like the pages, they get real hard with the passage of time. And like it's just -- it's not a pleasant smell. But this idea, what he's about to do, where he's like, "Okay, I know I can -- I have a contact back home, I can import high-quality tobacco, I need a buyer. I need a company in Argentina, right, that I can sell this tobacco to." So what he does is -- and it's interesting now reading back on my highlights because this is something he does later in life, like he doesn't spread himself thin. He starts off just trying to sell it to -- going to all the tobacco buyers in Argentina. No one gives him the time of day, right? And so what he'll do later in life and what he's about to do are here is he just picks one person. I have one target, one lead. I'm going to pursue that person, and I'm not going to give up. So the idea is just focus on one completely instead of spreading yourself thin. So he says, "Well, still working at the telephone company at night, Aristotle visited tobacco companies by day, attempting the interest of chief buyers into giving him an order. Week after week after week went by, and he was unable to see someone in any authority, in any company who can make a decision whether to buy or not." "Eventually, he chose the one cigarette manufacturer that he believed might give him a chance." And what he did, and this is the thing I remember most of that book that I read, is he pursued him day by day. He just showed up -- I think he followed them for like 2 weeks. And eventually, the guy is like, "Dude, I see you every day. Like what do you want, right?"

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Like you're -- and this guy is an older successful businessperson. You don't want to be annoying, this is what I'm saying, but like I'm sure that person, just like this guy, like I at least admire your persistence. So it says, "Eventually, he chose one cigarette manufacturer that he believed might give him a chance. Although the buyer had already refused to see him, right, he stood outside the building each morning until he learned to recognize the Company President." So he's going to the very, very top. He's like, "I've already tried to sell to this company. The buyers are ignoring me. Let me go straight to the top." And so eventually, the guy, they have a conversation on the street. And it says, "Aristotle explained that he had samples of some exciting new tobaccos, and he had been unsuccessful not only in gaining an order but even seeing anyone who could or would make a decision." So the President, his name -- his last name is I think Guyana. Guyana was impressed with Aristotle's sincerity and arranged a formal meeting for the next day with the Head of the purchasing department. So I'm always amazed when I see like these young smart college students, right? Usually, I mean you don't have to be a college student, but this is the thing that pops my mind, when people are looking for jobs, right, you're just fresh out of college, not sure what to do. And so the standard approach, let me just send my resume out to hundreds of people. It's like almost like you're just like spamming your resume everywhere. And like, "I don't understand we're not hired." The smarter move, and I amazed that young kids figure this out, is they target 1 or 2 companies they really want to work for. They do an extensive amount of research for them. And then they went up cold e-mailing the founder of the company. And it's not just say, again, we've learned this when you study -- the reason it's so beneficial to study like the advertising agency founders and the copywriters from old -- David Ogilvy, Claude Hopkins, Albert Lasker is because they understood that you have to appeal to interest. Everybody is busy, everybody is selfish, right? And so if you just e-mail and say, "Hey, I just graduated. Hire me," it was like, no, that's not -- that's based on like your own selfish as hire. You have to serve those people.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so what I'll see is like they'll study the company, and then they'll send an e-mail with, "Hey, I downloaded your app, or I used your service or whatever. And here's the things I think I would do differently or here's some suggestions for improvement," or whatever the case is. Like, "here's what the -- basically providing value and ideas before asking in return. And a lot of times, they wind up getting hired because they went straight to the top. And so what happens here, right? He's like, "Hey, I've tried to go through the normal channels in your company. No one is willing to talk to me. I have a unique product. I think your company will benefit by having higher-quality tobacco. I have the resources to import this tobacco for you. I'm willing to do this at unbelievably low prices because I have new customers," which is what Aristotle does. "And so I'll make lower margins, but I need -- basically like you benefit because I'm charging you less, and I benefit because you're my first customer," right? And so what happens is the President, the guy running the company, the most -- the person that has the ability to say, "Hey, take this meeting with this young kid". What is the difference when -- if you just go and you wind up getting a meeting with a buyer, right, yourself, through the normal channels, that's one way to do it, okay? Aristotle tried that way, didn't succeed. Now what does this guy say? This guy says, "Okay, I'm impressed with your sincerity. I'll arrange a formal meeting the next day with the head -- the person that's in charge of my purchasing department." That's -- it's not coming from below. It's coming from the top. I'm not just a guy coming, "Hey, I have something that might benefit your company." No, the President of the company said, "Hey, meet with this dude." What do you think is going to be the result? A buy, a purchase order, "Oh, this guy must be special. The President's telling me to meet with him. Okay." Well, even if you didn't like what he was selling, you're probably still going to -- you'll probably do an order because, "Oh, the president told me to meet with them." The result was a sale. $10,000 worth of Turkish Leaf was purchased. So he's making $40 a week busting his a**, working overtime, working at night, and he just got a $10,000 order.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So that idea is stuck with me. If you're ever in a situation like that, don't -- like focus on one person. Don't spread yourself thin. Like really think about what you're doing. "During the next 2 years, still working with the telephone company and cautiously maintaining his expensive lodgings, Onassis continued to import tobacco into Buenos Aires. $2 million over the next 2 years, he imported. His personal profit was over $100,000." So think about that, if he would have just stayed at his job. In 2 years, he made, let's say, $40, that's what 20. He made 48 years of income because if he's making $40 a week, that's 2,500 weeks. He made 2,500 weeks of income just by importing this in 2 years. So it says, "Then he took that money." And again, this is something he's going to do over and over again. He's like, "All right, while I'm importing tobacco, why don't I try to make cigarettes as well?" He's importing tobacco for cigarette makers. So he says -- he's like, "Okay, I can do this myself." He winds up -- his cousins are over there, too. He says they opened a small shop to manufacture their own luxury brand of cigarettes. So he understood about the importance of differentiation. He wrapped his cigarettes an attractive gold foil before packaging. The cigarettes were very expensive. They were extremely mild, and they were tipped with rose leaves. He sold them mostly to women, some of whom were taking up smoking for the very first time. So by this point, he has quit the telephone company. He's importing tobacco, right? And then he's making a good amount of money being an actual cigarette manufacturer himself. He's got like 30 people doing the actual work and making the cigarettes. But the problem is a flood of new companies come into this market. You can hand all cigarettes. It's not that difficult. There's a low barrier to entry. And so he's realizing, well, the profit I was able to get out of this is very short-lived. Now the competition is driving down prices.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Onassis' order for such a gigantic tanker was placed because he believed in the future of the oil business. Within 10 years, oil consumption would be on a rapid increase. And within 2 decades, oil would be supplying more than one 1/3 of the world's energy. So this is where -- this is the foundation. This decision is the foundation. He's already rich, but this gets like out of hand rich, like billionaire rich. During all the time -- all this time, Onassis would be on the forefront of one -- as one of the leading transporters of oil throughout the world. Oil tankers could be serviced in a fraction of the time that was needed to load a dry cargo freighter because you could just hook it up in the pipeline, right? In addition to the great savings and wages with minimal people to oversee the project, there was also safety in not being detained by the costly and constant longshoreman strikes that were common in ports all over the world. At that time, Onassis supertankers were the largest ships of any kind in history. So that's what I mean about boldness. When he has an idea, like he doesn't, "I'm going to put my toe in." He's like, "No, I'm going all in." And it's interesting, too, where he goes from being very frugal when he was younger to now like his -- even his oil tankers, like very luxurious. Like they have like grand pianos and stuff and like gold-plated like faucets and all this ridiculous stuff. I remember one of my favorite things in that invisible billionaire book, where Daniel Ludwig is the opposite of Onassis. He had more of like an engineering mindset, Spartan. "My ships are literally just anything you need to transport oil or nothing else." And so he was asked a time like, why don't you have -- because they call them the fabulous Greeks. There's actually a book by that name I might read in the future. It's about Onassis and all -- there's a bunch of very successful Greek shipowners and oil transporters at this time. And so Ludwig was asked. He's like, "Why don't you have like grand pianos like the Greeks?" And he says, "Because you can't carry oil in a grand piano." So that's always funny. He just has a very -- I'm going to give you -- like I'm just going to be focused on the actual job at hand.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he does another thing that we see over and over again. He's like, "Okay, I need to figure out what is the best use of my time." So he's going to focus on his most promising business. And right now, he's going to ditch the cigarette manufacturing just to focus on tobacco importing, right? Eventually, he's going to make so much money in ships. He's like, "I got to close my tobacco," even when it was profitable. He will close down a business because he realizes like, "I can make 10x, 100x, 1,000x as much money in shipping as I can in tobacco. So it does not make sense for me to spend any of my time doing this." Another smart -- again, he's got very good intuition. So note I left for myself on this page something I just told you, focus on his most promising business. He does this throughout his career. "His efforts in cigarette manufacturing, although they had expanded greatly from the beginning were no longer profitable. There were hundreds of small manufacturers throughout the city. Each attempted to garner the other customers, and the competition and price-cutting were fierce. Eventually, he decided 'I'm going to concentrate entirely on importing tobacco and other products.'" So he's an importer and an exporter, right? And he is a customer of these giant shipping concerns. He's like why are these guys that own these shipping concerns -- the shipping businesses so wealthy?" He's like, "Well, why don't I do what they do?" So he winds up befriending one of them and learning a lot. And then he does another smart thing that I'll get to in a minute. He was interested in getting into shipping not just as an importer or one who merely uses ships as he had been doing, but by owning the ships and enjoying the highly profitable cargo rates. Alberto Dodero, a brilliant and rich Argentine shipowner, became a friend of Onassis and had an influence on him. So he was like, "Well, before you get into shipping, like why don't you" -- and we've seen this over and over again. I did the biography of Daniel Ludwig, the invisible billionaire. It's Founders #68, if you haven't listened to that already. He's actually a competitor of Onassis. Very, very different than Onassis, like almost -- basically the complete opposite. But a lot -- the reason I bring this up is because a lot of these -- before they get into and own these giant shipping companies and actually make money in cargo, they flip ships at the very beginning.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

That's how they learn about them. And so that is what Onassis going to do here. His friend, Alberto, knows about this small tanker that sank. And a lot of these can be -- like you can take them back out of the ocean, have them repaired because they sell at like salvage rates, and then you could find a buyer. And so it says, "A small empty tanker had a half sunk and was available for sale for $10,000. So Onassis has found that the repair cost would be within reason and then, with the advice of Dodero, determined that comparable ships, we're selling for at least 10x the amount it would cost him to put this one in order. Within a matter of days, so he buys a ship. Within a matter of days, the ship was afloat. And a week later, Onassis sold it. This is like, wow, I made a lot of money, really, really quickly. I'm making good money in tobacco, but this is really fast this is with each success it became to him an ecstasy of a very real sort. So he's hyped up. The year was 1929, 6 years since he had come to Argentina to make his way in the world. He had just celebrated his 23rd birthday. His estimated net worth was $1 million. So he decides to go home to visit his family, but that is not the actual real reason. He has to go because there's a chance that a new law passed in Greece would actually put him out of business. So this is -- a lot can change in 6 years. Coming home, so his business isn't taxed to Oblivion. So it says, "It's not difficult to imagine the family's reaction to the confident prodigal son, now a millionaire and traveling first-class, arriving at the same dock from which he had departed as a humiliated and embittered young man 6 years before." And this is why he's coming home. "Greece had initiated a decree that sharply increased the import tax on any goods from countries with which it did not have a signed treaty. Argentina was one of those countries. In retaliation against the Greek tax, Argentina raised its import tax, which is exactly what, so that's going to affect Onassis' business, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It raises import tax to such an exorbitant extent that Onassis might have been driven out of the business if the situation had continued. So this is also talked about the boldness, and that's another term that Onassis uses over and over again. He's like, "you have to be bold." The boldness of a 23-year-old Onassis like, well, I'll just go home and try to get the petition and to get this law changed. If he could convince Greek authorities to discontinue the levy on Argentina ships, Argentina would undoubtedly reciprocate. It was then that he decided that a trip to Greece would be necessary. So he gets a meeting with this guy that's in the Greek government. The guy is basically like, I'm not going to listen to this young punk. He's basically just doing his nails and like kind of ignoring him. And Onassis gets angry and storms out, but he says something that's smart at the end of the meeting because his whole point is like we're making -- like the law should be changed. Basically, he knew that you have to appeal to the other person's interest, right? And so his point is that we're selling Greek -- like the Greek citizens are making a ton of money because I'm getting the tobacco from Greece and importing it into Argentina. And so he yells at the guy. He goes, "You're more interested in your nails than in Greek commerce," and so he storms out. And it's because a few days later, he's going to get a call to come back. And this is how he gets paid. He gets paid to study the shipping industry. So they want to do some research on him. They realize he has all the contacts in Argentina. He's got a lot of contacts in Greece. So they decided to hire him, to make him the official government liaison, right? Onassis would be the perfect liaison for Greece with the Argentine government and intend to negotiate a trade agreement. And so Greece passed this law, not that they wanted. They -- basically it's like playing hardball as a way to incentivize other countries to have a trade agreement, right? They -- so if you really think about Onassis is presenting himself as a solution to the problem that they have, okay?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, he would be the perfect liaison for Greece with the Argentine government in an attempt to negotiate a trade agreement. Although he had been back in Athens just 2 weeks. Aristotle Onassis was soon sailing to Argentina with diplomatic status. So he winds up connecting the people that wind up hammering out this deal," okay? Soon, a reciprocal -- I can't pronounce that word, advantageous trade agreement between Argentina and Greece was reached. As a result of his success, Onassis was appointed as Greek Consul-General in Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires, the harbor that he works out of was accommodating over 1,000 Greek ships a year. The most important positive factor was that he thoroughly learned the machinations of the shipping industry as the post of the console proved to be a business listening post of incalculable value. So this post they put him in, he's got to do all kinds of stuff. He's got -- he says he's got to organize the consul staff to complete paperwork, which he had approved while also settling disputes and strikes, negotiating the complicated legal problems connected with international trade. Just all the -- basically he's learning the ins and outs of international trade via shipping, right? And he's getting paid to do this. He was constantly visiting and inspecting ships, talking to ship owners and other importers and quietly absorbing everything. This is what his life's work, right -- what's going to soon to be is life's work rather, "Making a very conscious attempt to learn as much as he could before the going into ship-owning seriously." And then we also say at this point, he's like one of these psychopathic guys, like a Bill Gates where they'll work for days at a time and then just crash. So it says, "He was known to be able to work for 48 even 72 hours at a time without any sleep at all, then collapsing into bed and sleeping for 12 or 14 hours." And then we see at this time, he's doing -- I always talk about that fantastic talk by Bill Gurley on YouTube, which is called Runnin' Down a Dream, where he talks about what Danny Meyer did to start his restaurants, what Bobby Knight did to study for the best coaches of history, what Bob Dylan did to study from great musicians, and he terms this professional research.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it's all the stuff that you do to learn to teach yourself something when you're not working. So the term for that is professional research. Onassis is engaged in that as well. "Onassis just continues to look for opportunities to become a ship owner and operator. And as his tobacco and porting business continue to grow, he traveled to London, Amsterdam, Antwerp, and the other great ports of the world and to the shipyards of many countries, looking for and learning about ships." And so this is where he jumps into being a shipowner. There's a lot of these examples in -- through our history where there's like an economic depression, are they overbuilt, but you can buy these like gigantic ships for almost no money. So it doesn't even make any sense. So this is how he starts getting -- he gets started. The Canadian National Steamship Company had a small fleet of freighters that were docked in Montreal for 2 years, which they were putting up for sale. They were facing bankruptcy. So they had little choice but to take whatever they can get for the ships. The Great Depression adversely affected every industry. Shipping was especially suffering. There were many ships but not many cargo. Onassis had long since begun to formulate a personal business philosophy. "The key to success", he said, "Was boldness, boldness, and more boldness." Without hesitation, Onassis made an offer of $20,000 per ship, which was -- the ships were worth a lot more. There was no buyers. He figured that was theirs. How much they would give if they had to scrap them, right? "Onassis had concluded that, because the ships have been docked for 2 years, this steamship company had apparently been unable to sell them. He chose to gamble on the possibility that he was the only bidder. His offer was accepted." So let's get into a little bit about how he worked, and he kept up these work habits for most of his life. He was a workaholic obsessed with details. Onassis spent almost all of his time working. He would pore over shipping journals from Antwerp, Vancouver, Hamburg, and New York, looking for intelligence, trends, and opportunities.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He would scan, study and memorize tonnage, prices, insurance rates, and schedules of the world's great and small steamship companies and then attempt to outbid his competitors. He read the maritime sections of at least 6 foreign language daily newspapers every day. That part reminded me of Warren Buffett, where he, at one point -- I mean he probably still does, but he read so much that he'd be able to -- he had a mental picture in his mind, a mental image in his mind of every single public company that was available in America. And so we see Onassis doing that, but he's doing it on a global level and for ships. One thing about Onassis, and I'll go into more detail, because there's like one sentence in this book that I feel like summarizes who he was as a person. And he's got a lot of -- like he's not a -- I wouldn't -- he's not a good guy or he's not all good. He's a very complicated person. And towards the end, like he does some disgusting things. He winds up getting indicted for corruption. He winds up beating his wives. I mean there's like a lot of gross stuff in this book. And I'm not trying to excuse that behavior by any means. But I thought about that. I started getting like disgusted by some of what this guy -- there's a lot of selfishness in his life, I guess. The important part is like, I think, reading these books is -- sometimes I hear interviews with other entrepreneurs, like modern-day entrepreneurs on their podcasts, and it's just like this is -- it's not like -- this is not all like roses and happy times. A lot of these people are just straight-up ruthless. And I feel like the interviews, they mischaracterize what the real world is like, especially the world of business. Like one of the things I learned from Ed Thorp, who was like my personal blueprint in life, that's Founders #93, he said in the book, like he's 80-something years old right in that book. He's like, "Listen, if there's an opportunity for a human to make money or to grab some kind of advantage, like there is inevitably corruption in that situation, no matter what it is." And in the case of gambling, he talks about Wall Street. If you remember in that book, he found -- he was looking at Madoff's returns. Like, "This guy is clearly like lying and scamming."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And that was like a decade before -- a decade or 2 decades before Madoff wind up getting -- admitting to the Ponzi scheme. But I guess like the benefit of reading a biography is like you get an accurate representation of what human nature actually is, not what we want it to be. And I think where we have people in modern day giving interviews, like they're only giving us the good parts. The books give us the good parts and the bad parts. And this is -- Onassis is a very hard -- and I'm not -- bidder is not the right word. Like think about what he went through. His grandmother dies, his aunts, his uncles are murdered by other humans, right? They're hung. They're burned to death in a church. He sees a priest getting crucified, blinded in the eyes with a sword. Like you're going to have a very dark view of other humans. And so maybe like he's very -- Onassis' very pronounced degree of selfishness might be perfectly logical. And I'm not saying I like the stuff he does later on life, like hitting your wife, like come on, that's scumbag stuff, right? But this ruthlessness that he approached his business, and he has got a cutthroat nature. I do think it's some kind of defense mechanism. I can't imagine being -- imagine being 16 years old and seeing most of your family murdered and burned to death. I don't think that's something you get over ever. I think that's something you carry with you through your whole life. And so one way to understand Aristotle is like, "I'm only doing things for my benefit." And one of that was he'd consider himself Greek, but he didn't really believe in the idea of a country or religion like his religion, his -- he believed in Aristotle Onassis. That's we see it, and that's where it stops. There's actually a quote in the Difference Between God and Larry Ellison. It's a quote from the movie Citizen Kane, which is obviously written about William Randolph Hearst. I'm going to read you because I think it applied to William Randolph Hearst, it applied to Larry Ellison. I think it applies to Onassis. It applies to a lot of these people. But it says, "You want to know what I think about Charlie Kane?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Well, I suppose he had some private sort of greatness, but he kept it to himself. He never gave himself away. He never gave anything away. He just left you a tip. He had a generous mind. I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions, but he never believed in anything except Charlie Kane. He never had a conviction except Charlie Kane in his life." And I think that -- just that quote is a fantastic writing -- fantastic quote that I think about all the time. But that quote popped into my mind several times where I'm reading this book. Like he is -- he believes -- the note I left for myself on this is avoiding taxes was his religion, but really like he believed in the religion of Aristotle Onassis. At first, all of Onassis' ships were registered under either Greek or Argentinian flags, but he soon learned that there was great advantages to be had by registering them elsewhere, even though it might be considered as somewhat unethical. Onassis began a practice of registering them under so-called flag of convenience. This guarantees that he had to pay little or no taxes for any profits he made from those ships and has saved him money by lowering wages for the crews and by reducing safety standards. And so he says, "Onassis felt no pangs or conscious in sailing his ships under flag of convenience. He described it this way. "As a Greek, I belong to the West. As a shipowner, I belong to capitalism." Just some random things here -- a random thing I should tell you that he was relentless. He would just call -- I remember hearing a story from Elon Musk's first wife. And she's like, you always knew it was Elon when the phone rang because if you didn't answer, it'd just keep ringing over and over again. She said -- she described him -- when she met him when he was in college, she described him as like the terminator. Like he would set his eyes on something, and he was like, "You will be mine," whether it's a business, a girl, whatever the case is -- a woman rather. Onassis has some of that. If you don't answer his letters or his calls, he's showing up in person. He traveled to Sweden and, unannounced, burst into [ Heaton's ] office. "I had just received -- I had received mail from him from London, from Paris, from Athens, from Buenos Aires," said Heaton describing their meeting.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"So when my secretary said, Mr. Onassis wants to speak to you, I said, put him through, thinking he was on the phone. The next moment I looked up, and Onassis was standing in front of my desk. In a matter of seconds, he was able to convince me to accept the deal I had refused so many times. He was a sorcerer." And so that is another thing that we see over and over again. Like there is an extreme value but it's an intangible but very real valuable on being charismatic, being persuasive. I was just rereading over my notes from the George Lucas biography that I did the way back on Founders #35, and he talked about that. George was famous -- history was his famous -- favorite subject. He loved reading biography when he's younger. He's in his early 20s and he meets Francis Ford Coppola. And he's like, "That is the most charismatic guy I've ever come across." And he's like, "Listening to -- he said something like, "He could sell ice to Eskimos." I forgot exactly the term he used about Coppola, but he's like, "Oh, okay. Now I completely understood like people like Caesar, the great people of the past, and how they were able to influence those around them and essentially sell them on their ideas." Some people use that for politics. Some people use it for commerce. Onassis is going to use it for commerce, but he's one of these people. Later in life, he's very wealthy, but he's very like a short like -- kind of like stubby guy. And people like how is this guy like having affairs with the most famous women in the world, like most of which are like a foot taller than him and much younger than him. And a lot of that obviously has to do with his wealth but also like his charisma. So I don't know. It doesn't say how, and I don't remember how, but he just has the instinct. He's like, "Okay, I'm like, "I have ships, but I'm just hauling cargo. If I could haul like oil, like there's a huge boom in oil that's coming. We're going to stop hauling coal, and I'm going to switch everything to oil. So oil is coming, let's get ahead of this massive transformation." Boldness, boldness, and more boldness is the note I left on the page. It says he knew this. I'm not sure how he knew it, though, but this is his thinking on this.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So World War II, as we've seen over and again like you have the entire world -- almost the entire world focused on one event, it creates these massive fortunes. And if you're just like right place, right time, right industry. He -- Onassis was one of them. The Nazis wind up holding -- he's got a bunch of like European ships that they don't let -- so he loses like a big chunk of his fleet at this point in history. And yet because the demand for ships is so high, even though he's now operating at like -- maybe he lost, I don't know, 30%, 60% of his fleet, something like that. He makes a ton of money, they call it an ocean of money, because the rates go up, because the demand is so high. "Even though his fleet had been markedly depleted because of his inability to use some of the supertankers, he put his remaining ships to profitable use sailing for the allies, and, as a result, collected unusually high wartime shipping rates. He made what was once described as an ocean of money from the war." And this is what I meant about focus because at this time, this is where he's like, "Oh, I'm closing my tobacco business." Despite the fact that he was realizing handsome profits from tobacco, in 1942, Onassis suddenly moved his entire operations to New York, closing down his tobacco operation and concentrating all of his efforts on increasing his shipping interest. By the end of the war -- by the time -- excuse me, by the time the war was over, his fortune was estimated to be $30 million. He is 39 years old. So a really important thing to point out to you. So Onassis is not the first one to do what he did. There are a ton of very -- like he made friends with this Argentinian shipowner. He just saw like -- and I think that's very instructive. It's like, "I don't have to." Sometimes you think, "Other people are doing this, I can't possibly do it, too." It's like, "No, you probably can." At least you know there's demand for it. So not only is there other people, there's Argentinians, but there's other Greek -- like he winds up marrying into this family of a guy at the point -- at this time that is way more successful than him. And he winds up marrying into them and doing business with him and learning from him.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So Onassis is almost 40 years old. And this is where he's going to marry into -- this is an introduction into this guy named -- oh my goodness, these Greeks have the best names, Stavros Livanos. And this guy is actually going to marry two of his daughters off to -- one to Onassis and one to another one of another like Greek shipping -- up-and-coming like Greek shipping magnate. And then they wind up having like this -- they do -- Onassis and this other guy, Niarchos, wind up doing business, and then they also hate each other. It's just -- it's bizarre, okay? So he says his sisters are telling him like, "You need to marry a Greek girl." Like, "You have to marry." They're very like adamant about this. Later on, when he marries Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, like if you're -- like there's a lot of people like this. I have friends that are South American, and they want -- they only want -- like their family wants them to marry just like whether it's Colombians or Argentinians. I have Asian friends who only marry -- this is very common. So he comes from a family that is, "We're Greek. You're only allowed to marry Greek people, okay?" And so this is really a marriage of convenience. The reason I'm giving you this background is because it's not like -- Onassis, he's uncontrollable. Like he was never faithful. He says later -- he's like, "I will do exactly as I please." That is the one-sentence summary of Onassis, right? And so he's going to marry into this family. But -- and this is going to be the mother of his children and everything else, but it's just like Onassis only has one religion, and that's himself. So you marry a Greek, Onassis needed no convincing because he was -- already begun spending time with Tina, who was 17. This is all -- he's 40. I just -- you read these books, and you try to put yourself into these positions. And I'm like, I just don't know with this guy, Tina's father, was thinking. You can never imagine hooking -- like trying to set up my daughter with a 40-year-old, right, 17-year-old daughter, I don't know. She was 17, and he was also spending time with Eugenia, which is a 19-year-old, the 2 daughters of Stavros Livanos, who is the owner of the largest private fleet in the world.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"At that time, Livanos was so wealthy that he could -- check this out. This is a wild sentence, right? "At that time, Livanos was so wealthy that he could have easily acquired all of Onassis' holdings for cash without markedly tampering with his own assets. Not only had Livanos control -- not only did Livanos control a vast shipping empire, but he had spent many years on the sea himself. So this is one of those guys that -- back to that old Sam Zemurray quote, "If you know your business from a to z, there's no problem you can't solve," how Sam started out peddling like rotten -- or almost rotten Bananas. He knew -- by the time he owned his own banana company, he knew every single aspect to the banana business, right, which was a huge advantage when he competed against people that just came up and never worked in a plantation, never sold bananas. They just happen to be executives in a banana company, right? He kicked their a** up and down the street in that book. But Livanos is one of these guys. Like his whole life was the sea and shipping. He spent years on the sea himself, first as a deckhand. And finally, he's captain of one of his father's ships. He held a Master Mariner certificate, and nothing pleased him more than to talk for hours about ships and the sea. He liked Onassis except for one strong reservation. So this guy would love Daniel Ludwig because what I'm about to tell you. "Livanos almost paranoia -- was almost -- was paranoically imposed -- opposed, excuse me, to any kind of personal publicity. And although he was besieged by reporters from all over the world eager to do a profile on him, he never consented to do an interview." If you remember the book, The Invisible Billionaire, Daniel Ludwig hired a PR firm to keep his name out of the papers, the exact opposite of what most people hire PR firms for, right? Onassis, conversely, was interested in personal publicity, and he welcomed most opportunities to gain stories about himself in the press. Livanos went to great lengths to avoid publicity. So this fundamental idea, though, like that's -- he takes that idea of oil is going to be really important.

"I'm going to build up the largest fleet -- larger ships, largest fleet. I'm going to go after every single oil contract in the world I can." That's basically what he does for the rest of his life, right? And he does that for multiple decades. He's going to die 68 years old. He figures this out when he's about 38. So he's got 3 decades of building. In some cases, like there's -- any time there's like kind of disruption in shipping channels of the world and oil production in the world. In 1 year, he makes like $100 million because when the Suez Canal is blocked. But he also is -- he's corrupt, for sure. Like he doesn't care about laws. He'd try to avoid taxes, does all this other stuff. So he was being arrested for corruption. This has to do with like buying -- the U.S. after World War II was trying to unload like the liberty ships and all these other -- like they had accumulated this large fleet, and now they're selling it. There was laws at the time that they had to be under American ownership. He sets up all these shell companies. And he basically like finds ways to violate the law. And he winds up getting arrested for corruption. He's going to wind up like paying fines and not spending time in jail, but he does go to jail. So he says -- I think he's in like Athens at the time, and he gets this -- there's like this press release that -- there's arrest warrants that he's being indicated for corruption. And so him and his brother-in-law, Niarchos, and other 18 -- 18 other corporations are named in this indictment. Niarchos, like, "I'm staying in London. I'm not -- then Onassis makes the mistake. He's like, "I'm going to show up in-person." Remember I said earlier, like he has this habit of just showing up in-person. So listen to what happens. I'm just going to bring this up, but he shows up in America. So it says, "Onassis wanted to confront the U.S. government head-on. When Onassis received no response to his telegram, -- remember, if he writes you letters and you he calls and you don't respond, he's showing up in-person. He barged into the Attorney General's office. "I want to know what this indictment is all about," he demanded. "Let's have a showdown here now."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The Attorney General excused himself, left the office, and returned with a U.S. Marshal who placed Onassis into custody. He became one of the richest men in U.S. history ever to be arrested. And so the reason I bring that up is because, later in his life, I mean he please out, pays a fine. They turn over ownership, like 51% ownership to American Corporation, the stuff that you would expect a really wealthy person that has access to the best attorneys and most likely bribing politicians to do, right? The reason I bring this up is because this haunts him throughout his life. He winds up being really good friends with Winston Churchill, which was really surprising -- one of the most surprising things I learned when I read the first biography Onassis. When he marries Jacqueline Kennedy, same thing. They're like you're -- he's -- the American politicians go and start having speeches on the floor of Congress. Her family talked about, "You can't marry a foreigner with -- that's been indicted," et cetera, et cetera. So that's something that falls around for the rest of his life. I'm fast-forwarding way into the book towards the end of his life now because most of it is just the expansion of that one idea, right? And we're more interested in like how people get their starts in the beginning of the career, then he's already super, super wealthy and just kind of diversifying into all these other business classes, shipping, gets into whaling, there's all kinds of other stuff like that. But this is an idea that I've seen pop up over and over again. He's going to take it to an extreme. But I do think when you look at -- when you ask people, when you are able to survey entrepreneurs like why you do what you do, like why are you working for yourself, why don't you go get a job, and usually people think it's about money. Mostly it's about control. It's about having control over how you spend your time. Basically, you can -- a company is like building your own little miniature country or miniature world, right, that you get to design. And a lot of them like I thought about Stephen King recently, Steven Spielberg, a lot of -- there's a lot of echoes in those last 2 books I read but about the idea that they didn't really like the world they were in. So they built their own world.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And some of that, to some degree, is figuratively. In Onassis' case, it's literally. So he builds a world within the world. And it's this -- he has this floating yacht called the Christina, which is named after his daughter. And he says, from the first time of the maiden voyage and for the remainder of his life, Onassis spent more time on the Christina than in any of his houses, apartments or villas spread throughout the world. Being on the sea, in control of wherever he wanted to go, his privacy intact, it enabled him to be the captain of his own directives and to feel totally independent." "For Onassis, the Christina was truly his home. Once, when asked, where all -- out of all of his houses where he preferred to live, he snapped, 'the Christina, of course.'" And so you have -- think about like a combination of a floating mansion and floating office skyscraper. He's running his entire business from there. He's on it all the time, moves from port to port. He's constantly -- like he cultivates -- remember, he's a very manipulative person. He's a very charismatic person. So he will cultivate relationships with people, and it's hard to tell how many of them are genuine. I have a feeling that his friendship, his close friendship with Churchill towards the end of Churchill's life is actually genuine on Aristotle's part because like Churchill is one of his heroes. He's greatly admired what he was able to do during World War II, right? But a lot of this, to me, when I'm reading this, is like you just collected people that were -- could serve him or could help him in some way or form. But this idea of -- I kind of went off a tangent that I didn't mean to, but this idea of like creating your world within -- your own world within the world, it's very interesting to me. It's something that pops up in the books over and over again. Again, it doesn't have to be on, I think, like a 300-foot yacht or whatever this is, but I do think it is a very powerful idea. And I think usually at the center of these worlds is some kind of company that you own or control or wealth that you're able to generate through investments or whatever it is, that usually comes first, right? Let's go a little bit about this Churchill. There were some occasions when the number of guests were strictly limited because he'd have princes, royalty from all over the world, the richest people, the most famous people.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Like Onassis in his day was one of the most well-known -- especially when he married Jacqueline Kennedy, like one of the most famous -- and not only is he one of the richest people on the planet when he was alive, he's also one of the most famous. So every single person you could possibly imagine, every politician from countries all over the world, he would take them and expose them to unbelievable luxury on the Christina. So it's his home, it's his office, but it's also a way to buy and influence these very powerful and rich people, Churchill being one of them. "'There were some occasions when the number of guests were strictly limited. You can fit tons of people in there. But when Churchill's on board, my focus is on Churchill.' However, that was whenever Winston Churchill and his wife were on board. So the first time Churchill met him, this is what Churchill wrote in his diary, "I met a man yesterday called Onassis. He is a man of mark." And so this is where the author does a great job here in this one paragraph just comparing and contrasting Onassis with Churchill, so people did not understand their relationship. And it says, "To many, the closeness between Onassis and Winston was difficult, if not impossible, to understand. Churchill, understandably -- or excuse me, undeniably, was one of the greatest public figures of the 20th century and one of its best-educated and most brilliant. He was a statesman and a leader of the highest order. First Minister to the King of England, a Nobel Prize winner, not only for literature but for oratory as well. Churchill was one of the world's grand old men, revered not only by the British but throughout every Western country." "What did he have in common with Aristotle Socrates Onassis, admittedly, one of the world's richest man but also a man who had been indicted and found guilty by the U.S. Justice Department, a business tycoon who used somewhat unethical practices to amass his fortune and a man who had carved out a reputation as a consummate playboy?" And so they talk a lot about the Christina. And really, the way to think about this is not only with his shipping empire and everything else, but he built his own world. He built a world within the world. I know I'm repeating myself, but this -- again, I just think that pops up over and over again.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Onassis with his own airline, his own fleet, his houses all over the world, was sovereign of his own personal kingdom." She was -- I need to pause here tell you what happening. He's trying to seduce Jackie Kennedy before JFK was killed. She's on cruise with him. There's a bunch of people. It's not just her, there's like her whole entourage and stuff. And so this is a description. He's -- again, really the only -- his ethics are just whatever is beneficial to himself. "She was amused and fascinated at his seemingly unending supply of anecdotes and was impressed that even on their cruise, he was able to constantly conduct and control his businesses throughout the world. Cables and telephone calls from heads of state and the Presidents of the world's largest corporations arrived demandingly, and Onassis, sometimes even between dinner courses, dictated replies and returned calls that had multimillion dollar implications. Whereas Jack Kennedy ruled a country, Onassis seemed to rule the world. Their Christina was busier than the Oval Office." So after JFK was murdered, she continues to spend time with Onassis. This is before they're married. But really, this is a description of what it was like being around Aristotle Onassis, this cult of personality, this charisma that I've been trying to explain to you that's apparent in the book. And that does have an intoxicating effect on other people. "There was a certain charm about Onassis that she found fascinating. Onassis was a born orator, and Jackie would sit and listen to him spin off tails and stories, often racy tales, by the hour. She was never bored with him. He could keep a dinner party of some of the world's most sophisticated conversationalists spellbound as he told about his privileged childhood in Turkey, his whaling days in Antarctica, his relationships with Maria Callas, Winston Churchill, Eva Perón, Greta Garbo, speaking variously in any one or a combination of 7 languages."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"He talked with color, wit, imagination, and sensitivity, but he was also capable -- this is -- but he was also -- this next sentence call me off -- drew me off-guard completely. So I was like, "Oh, he talked with color, wit, imagination, and sensitivity, but he was also capable of breaking wind uninhibited in public with great beef and sonance and then laughing uproariously and with relish." So he's known to flatulate in public with -- this is in the description with great beef and sonance, I had to look up that word. I didn't know what sonance meant. It's just a loud sound. So he's spinning tails and then he's going to f_*_ in front of everybody and then laugh about it. There's not a sentence I was expecting to read in the book. "Even Jackie, as everyone else could not help it, drop her reserve and laugh with him. She simply never knew anyone quite as free or exotic as Aristotle Onassis, a paradoxical blend of raconteur and ruffian. He was so different from JFK, who rarely even kissed her in public, let alone said or did anything that was spontaneous and uncalculated." Her friends also were all intellectuals, proper cultured men of the salon who rarely expressed their inner feelings. Onassis was a man of the pier, but with the cocksureness of a king." So they eventually get married. I think they're married for 10 years, the last 10 years of his life. I'm pretty sure it was like a fake marriage. It's definitely an open marriage. Their marriage contract is in the book. It says we only have to spend time together on Catholic holidays and summer vacations. If we're traveling together, there needs to be separate rooms. Jackie doesn't have to give him -- is not required to give him a child. If they get divorced, he's got to pay her $10 million for every year that they were married. It is the opposite of like a loving -- I don't even know what to say about it. I'm pretty -- and it was an open marriage, bizarre, okay?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says Jackie continued to appear at concerts and society functions escorted by men she had been seeing before she married Onassis. He immediately explained the arrangement to all the people with raised eyebrows. And this is where we get into his -- the one-sentence summary of his own -- essentially summarizes himself. And so I'll point that out to you. And so he says, "Jackie is a little bird that needs its freedom as well as its security, and she gets them both from me. She can do exactly as she pleases, visit international fashion shows and travel and go out with friends to the theater anyplace." This is the one-sentence summary of himself, "And I, of course, will do exactly as I please. I never question her, and she never questions me." And so for the first 66 years of his life, even after going through unbelievable tragedy, he was known to be the life of a party, to be extremely charming. That never -- that changes his son. When the son is 24 years old, his son dies in a plane crash. And Onassis is never the same. It destroys him. He's like a dead man walking because he passes away 2 years later, but he's never recovered from this. And in those -- ages overnight, and then he just slowly slips into death. And so this is a little bit about that. "When Onassis returned from the hospital, everyone thought that his heart would burst. So inconsolable was he over the loss of his son. He cried ceaselessly. And in the early hours of the next morning, he went out into the street in a daze, wandering for hours. He could not and would not control his grief. And when he returned home and saw a crowd of newsmen in the front of the house, all he could mutter was, 'He was a good boy, a good boy,' and then he wept. Onassis seemed to lose all hope with the death of Alexander. Alexander was his hope. And he said to everyone that he could see no sense in living himself.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He saw himself in Alexander, and when his son died, so did he. And there is a certain level of like almost a curse on the family. Because if you look at it from his daughter's perspective, within 3 years, she loses a brother. The next year, she loses her mom at the age of 45 from heart troubles who survived long enough to lose her son, right? And then 2 years later, she loses her dad. So by the time Christina is 25, she's lost her brother, her mother, and her dad, and she dies from a heart condition at 37 years old. It's just devastating. And now the author wraps up the life -- the paradoxical life of Aristotle Onassis here. "The epic life of Aristotle Onassis is as mysterious as a tale from ancient Greek mythology and is a study of paradoxes, altogether gripping because of their seemingly inconsistencies. He was a man so gentle that he could happily play with a child for hours, while corporate executives cried for his attention, and yet he usually bullied and sometimes physically assaulted the people he loved. He would spend tens of thousands of dollars to please a friend but often insulted a waiter with little or no tip. He had no allegiance to any government, and yet he successfully coped and dealt with every Greek regime during his lifetime." "He had a love-hate relationship with the press, granting long interviews one moment, slugging a photographer the next. He ate in restaurants guaranteed to draw attention to himself, but he was never known to give anyone an autograph. He once bought 1 million ounces of gold. He owned his own Swiss bank. He had plans to build 1-million-ton tanker. He wanted to inaugurate the first aerial freighter, which would fly tourists back and forth to Europe with their cars. He hoped to buy an entire country so that he can never be plagued with taxes. And yet he was also known to explode into a fury at being overcharged by $2."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"He rarely ever gave to charity, but he virtually supported over 50 relatives and employed over 10,000 fellow Greeks. He dined and talked with kings and heads of states, but he'd like to spend most of his time with actors, gamblers, and old friends. He was born to manipulate and yet hated to give orders to underlings. He bought insurance for everything he owned and to cover every eventuality, and yet he claimed that, if he lost all of his money, he could easily, and without trauma, start all over again. "He was a man who prided himself on getting everything he ever wanted in his life, but he was often morose, misanthropic, and acrimonious. He continually followed one tenet of his own religion at all costs: To fulfill his own well-being, and yet he only truly wanted what he could not purchase, the mercy of the gods."

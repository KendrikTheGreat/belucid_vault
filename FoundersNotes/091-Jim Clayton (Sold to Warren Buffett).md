"Jim, this is Warren Buffett. I read your book over the weekend, and I enjoyed it very much. You did a good job on it. I followed your company for several years and congratulate you on taking it to the top of the industry. Give me a call. I'd like to get your views on the industry."

So that is a voicemail -- that's an excerpt from the book that I read this week, which is First A Dream by Jim Clayton. And that's actually a voicemail Warren left Jim after somebody gifted the book I have in my hand to Warren. He read it over the weekend, like he just said. And he winds up buying -- after reading the book, he winds up buying Jim's business for $1.7 billion in cash. And so Warren told this story, while I was going through -- a few weeks ago, I released a podcast on -- I read every single shareholder letter that Warren Buffett has ever written so far. It's like 54 years. So while I was doing that, Warren talked about reading the book and then buying the company. And I thought, okay, well, that's a no-brainer. If Warren Buffett read this book, recommended it, not only did he did recommend it, then he goes and spends $1.7 billion of his money on the guy's company. There's obviously a benefit to me reading it and then telling you what I learned by reading it. Before I jump into the rest of the book, I need a favor from you. If you leave a review for this podcast, take a screenshot and e-mail it to me, at foundersreviews@gmail.com. And I'll send you a private feed of seven podcast episodes that I've done that are available nowhere else. And if you're listening to this on Overcast, all you have to do is press that star that's on every episode. So this episode or any other episode that you happen to enjoy that you recommend, press the star, it will change colors. All you have to do is send me a screenshot of that to foundersreviews@gmail.com and I'll send you the private link as well. Okay, so let me go ahead and jump into this book. And I'm going to spend a lot of time talking about his early life because -- well, let me not run over my own points here. Let me just go ahead and get into it. We start at the very beginning of the book, and this is Jim writing.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He says, "The country was in the depths of the Great Depression four years running with no signs of letting up when I was born on a dirt farm in Tennessee. The region was ailing anyways, even without a depression, and we surely lived in one of the poorest parts. Dad was a sharecropper, farming on the halves, which meant that the landowner furnished the land and half the mules, seed and equipment. We, sharecroppers, supplied the sweat and energy to plant, cultivate and harvest the crops. The landowner received half of the harvest." And this is a very important sentence that Jim realized. "Sharecropping was a tradition dating back to colonial times and there is no known record of a sharecropper getting rich." So just how poor was Jim and his family when he was born. Well, this is how his dad paid the doctor to have Jim delivered. "Dad paid the good doctor, two chickens, three gallons of shelled corn and one home-cured country ham to bring me into the world. The year before, he and mother grossed only $100 the whole year. So there wasn't a whole lot of cash to go around." Now, I want to tell you a little bit about the environment -- like the house that he grew up in. "It was 600 square feet, a log cabin, no electricity, no running water, a tin roof and no bathroom. There was no insulation to speak of. So the cabin was like an ice box in the winter and an oven in the summer. The main room served as our bedroom, where all four of us slept about eight feet apart on two beds. There was no bathroom. In fact, we didn't even have an outhouse.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

During the cold months, we'd bring out the thunder buckets, which was kept under our parent's bed." You can imagine what that was used for. "Someone had to empty it out every morning." So I'm going to pause right here, and I just want to bring up two things to you that I think are very important. One, he goes from these living conditions to the Forbes 400 list. And when the sale is completed to Warren Buffett, he personally cleared something like $400 million to $500 million, okay? So he goes from, his parents making $100 a year and having to essentially go to the bathroom in a bucket to being one of the wealthiest people on the planet. So that's a very -- he has a very inspiring story. The second thing, right, which I find remarkable and I found out when I got to the end of the book was this book is self-published. He wasn't planning on it to sell as many copies as it did. He wasn't planning Warren Buffett to read it, certainly so. He just wrote it because he printed about 15,000 copies that he handed out to employees and friends and family. And then he's done several reprints since then because the book became so popular. But I just think it was a smart idea because he had to invest a few years writing the book, a little bit of money self-publishing it, but the optionality that he induced into his life, he had a capped downside. He only had spent a short amount of time and a limited amount of money, and then the upside was unlimited. I think that's extremely important for not only entrepreneurs but for anybody in life to cap your downside and keep your upside uncapped. So I want to jump right back into the book because those two things were just hard for me to wrap my mind around. And then he talks about like, okay, well, we're all living in a 600 square feet, all sleep in the same room. Its him, his brother and his two parents. And where is the privacy? And so he talks a little bit about that. He goes, "I didn't know exactly what was going on, but we knew something was up because our parents would suddenly insist that we go outside and play. Once we are outside, we'd see our parents cover up the window with a blanket.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Naturally, we wondered what the big mystery was." So his parents -- that's the only time -- and this only happened usually on Saturdays or Sundays when they had any kind of alone time. I'm going to talk about more about his early life and then some of his first jobs. And this is just -- it's mind-blowing what he had to do at five years old. So he says, "All four of us took turns using the same wash tub and the same water." So as you could imagine, the first person in the bath, you're going to get really good bath. The last one, you're essentially wallowed in filth. "Even something as mundane as drinking a glass of milk was preceded by a process that could charitably be described as labor-intensive. As a five-year-old, I'd be up at five in the morning to milk the cows and bring the two-gallon pail back to the house." So he gives the pail to his mom, his mom wipes out all debris, like filters the milk as best she can, and then she gives it back to him. He says, "Then she packaged the milk in half-gallon jars for me to carry back up the hill, past the barn, down the hill and through the meadow to finally deposit them into a cold spring. Later at suppertime, we'd go back for ice-cold, refreshing milk." And then just -- when I'm reading this section, I'm just like, man, I have nothing to complain about. Like I can go to the fridge at any time and get something cold to drink as most people that are listening to this podcast can. This guy is five years old, milking cows. This is a multi-hour process just to get a drink of cold milk. It's insane. As you can imagine, school, he says, "My brother, Joe and I had to walk four miles to school in the winter." And he talks about -- this is his first job, although it's unpaid. "Cotton was our money crop and was labor-intensive. At age five, I was proud to have dad promote me to a position of responsibility." So he went from picking cotton to being able to control the mules that plowed the land that the cotton was yielded on.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Dad never paid me for helping in the fields." This is his first job. He gets his first job from his uncle and now check this out. "I would sometimes plow for Uncle R.C. He gave me my first pay-for-work opportunity and my first feeling of self-worth that comes from being paid for work performed. Uncle R.C. would always acknowledge a job well done, giving me a lasting sense of pride. The pay for one day's cotton-row dragging was $0.25." Now they're going to talk about how -- like if you have no money -- if you're making such little amount of money, how are you going to feed and clothe your kids. "Well, our clothes were made out of feed sacks." So the sacks that they're using to feed the animals that are on their farm that then his mother repurposes with her sewing machine as clothing for her children. So he says, "Our clothes were made out of feed sacks, really. We would go to the general store, walk down the rows of feed sacks and shop for our new clothes." Now, this was what was remarkable about -- one of the remarkable things about the book is, he's not telling the story for you to be like, oh, like to pity him or to say you know what was me. His overarching lesson in the book is, listen, you don't determine the circumstances you're born into. But there's a lot of lessons that you can learn from those circumstances, apply them and then you can actually improve your life. And so even when he's noticing how poor his parents are, he learns business lessons from them that he then applies to his several businesses that he starts and operates later on. And this is one of them. He says, "Dad was an extremely good manager of what little money we had. Dad was able to minimize the expenses since he was a natural-born mechanic and enjoyed performing the maintenance themselves." So not only would he do this for automobiles, but later on, when Jim becomes a pilot, he does the same thing for his airplanes. "Thanks, Dad, for these business lessons, which we apply daily at Clayton Mobile Homes. Aircraft maintenance comes to mind, but in computer manufacturing equipment and all over the company, these lessons on buying good, used equipment and maintaining well is applicable."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I referenced this earlier, but I do think this -- the section I'm about to read to you is probably -- is the most important point in the book because it's going to be applied to so many different things. He says, "It probably sounds like we lived under extraordinarily harsh circumstances. But even in that time and in that place, I learned that certain concepts are ageless, no matter what century we're in. Self-discipline, willpower, perseverance, realizing that disappointment is not defeat, knowing that problems often present opportunities." So I'm just going to interrupt myself here and go back to one of my favorite quotes from the podcast I did on Henry Kaiser is, "Problems are just opportunities in work clothes." I think about that quote all the time. "Obstacles may get in the way, but the human spirit can triumph over these things. Adversity breathes resilience and can build character. It is possible to survive, even prevail. As a boy, I could never articulate these things. As a man, I was able to look back and apply these hard-won childhood lessons to my business and my life." And I just think that's the most important part, understanding that you can manipulate life. You can change it. You can poke it. You can have an effect on the outcome of not only your own life, but all those around you. I think that's extremely important for people not to just wallow. You might not be in a good situation today, but you can make the necessary adjustments and improve your situation in the future. Okay, now I'm skipping ahead. He's still a boy. In this section, I think what I took away from this section is there's a huge value in having examples that inspire you. And when Jim started his life as a young boy, he wanted to be like an opera singer, like country music, like guitar, singer person -- a musician, singer person.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And he looked up to this local guy named, Eddy Arnold, who winds up being one of the most successful country music artists, musicians in history. So he says, "All of us felt a kinship to Eddy because he was a hometown boy. He grew up near us. Eddy started out with nothing, no contacts and no hand-up. In fact, he started out just like me, a kid on a cotton farm who undoubtedly had a dream as he learned to sing and play the guitar. We appreciated that Eddy never tried to bury his dirt-poor heritage. In fact, he glorified it, considering his nickname was the Tennessee Plowboy." That's what they called the position that Jim had on the farm, plowboys. "Eventually, Eddy would have 28 #1 singles. He'd be the first country entertainer to host a primetime network TV show. Ultimately, he'd sell 90 million records. He was one of us, still in touch with his roots, confirming that any of us can find a way out of the cotton patch. His growing success was an inspiration to me as I shaped and nurtured my dream." So now in the story, Jim is about 10 years old. He understands that he doesn't have a lot of money. He's doing anything he possibly can. He will help out at his uncle's store. He'll work on other farms. He will collect bottles. He could do anything. And as a result of these activities, there's a lot of early valuable lessons in entrepreneurship that he applies later on to his many businesses. So he says, "In whatever spare time I could find, I sold flower seeds door-to-door." So he talks about now some of the incentives. We've talked about -- a lot about incentives in the past few weeks. If you listened to my podcast on Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger and how important it is to them and how they're constantly preaching the value of understanding the incentives that, not only like you give employees in your business, but that you see in all areas of life. That it's, I think, they say like the #1 shaper of human behavior. So in this case, the flower seed company that he's selling seeds for are also trying to organize and incentivize their sales force, right? And he says, "To entice us to sell, there were rewards. The seed company gave us a choice between prices or free products."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Now, he does something extremely smart here and extremely rare for a young child. He says, "I weighed my options carefully. Did I want a toy car, which would be instant gratification, or free seeds, deferred compensation?" And essentially, they're going to give you the product for free. "This decision was more consequential than I ever knew. Without realizing it, I was setting the tone in shaping a philosophy that would characterize the rest of my life. I chose the seeds. It was my first attempt to become an entrepreneur. Plowing the money back into my business was a smart move. I got to keep all the proceeds from those extra seeds, so it really increased my cash flow, but I learned something far more profitable. Forgo those things that give you momentary satisfaction. Look at the long term. Defer profits for something more substantial, pass up the plastic toy car and invest your capital. Plant the right seeds. One day, you could buy a new luxury car or better yet, start your own seed company." So when I'm reading these sections, that paragraph right there was written by Jim Clayton, it could have easily been written by Warren Buffett, could have easily been written by David Ogilvy, could have easily been written by Charlie Munger. So you don't have -- I'm in like the middle -- in case you haven't listed to these other podcasts, I'm in the middle of like a series. They're not -- you don't necessarily have to listen to them in order, although I guess I would because I kind of build on them on every podcast, but it starts with Warren Buffett shareholder letters, right? And then I take entrepreneurs and ideas that he talks about and then influence like the next book I did, which was David Ogilvy because Warren Buffett said he bought -- first of all, bought stock in Ogilvy & Mather, Ogilvy's public company, an advertising agency. But he also called him a genius. So I'm like, okay, well, if everybody around me is admiring Warren Buffett and learning from him, why am I not learning, like why don't I take that one step further and learn from the people Warren learned from?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And if you have somebody that Warren Buffett is calling a genius, like why won't I dedicate 10, 15 hours to read up on that person, which I did. Then, the very next week, I did Charlie Munger. Obviously, like I've done two podcasts on Charlie before. Somebody Warren's also extensively talked about how much he's learned from Charlie. Now when I -- now this week, I'm doing Jim Clayton. Again, somebody else Warren learned from and enjoyed. The next three weeks -- I guess, I wasn't even thinking about talking about this, but it kind of makes sense given where I find myself right now. The next three weeks, I'm also doing books on entrepreneurs that I learned about by reading Poor Charlie's Almanac. So the reason I'm bringing this all up is because I think it increases the depth and understanding you have listening to this podcast if you listen to all of them in order. I mean, you don't have to. Like I said, it's up to you. Do whatever you want. But I do think they're going to build on each other. And now I feel like I have a better understanding -- I'm like rambling here, but I'm trying to get to my point. I feel I have a better understanding of Jim Clayton and Warren Buffett by reading both Warren Buffett's shareholder letters and Jim Clayton's book, if that makes sense. You see how they kind of play on each other, and they share a lot of the same values. And then you start to absorb those values and admire them in your own life and hopefully apply them. So I just can't get over like that exact sentence or that exactly few paragraphs, is very in line with Buffett and Munger's philosophy on how they run Berkshire. And they have a company that's worth, what, $500 billion. I think they're sitting on like $120 billion of cash right now. Like there's a lot of education and useful information just by studying them. All right. Let me skip ahead a little bit. This is more about -- he gets really into -- so he is -- Jim Clayton has a rather unique set of skills. And what I admire about him and what I learned from him is like, he approaches problems very, like, straightforward. "Oh, I want to do this activity. I don't know how to do it. Okay, I'll learn how to do it." So he applied it.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He became a musician. He became a pilot. He became an engineer. He became an attorney. He became an entrepreneur. And I'm going to elaborate on more of that. But I feel that, that is very like -- very simple but not easy. And Charlie Munger always talks about like common sense, the reason they call it common sense is because it's really uncommon sense. But the standard default of humanity is like one of great miscognition is the word he uses and laziness. And so if you're just willing to constantly learn and not be lazy, that puts you ahead of 90% of all humanity because they won't do that. Now in this -- where we're at in the story, he gets obsessed with radio. It's like the main technology when he's a young person. He starts taking -- not only does he learn like how radio signals are transmitted, he's able to take apart and rebuild radios. And so while he's doing this, and he's, I think, 16 at this time, he just has this like a throwaway quote that I think applies to so much -- it applies to like the relentlessly resourceful nature that entrepreneurs and anybody that wants to get good at their craft. It's not exclusively the domain of entrepreneurs it has to wrestle with. And he says, "Shoestring operations offer tremendous opportunity. You have no choice but to learn everything." So he's talking about radio right now, which leads him to have jobs later on. But that is applied to everything. I think if you just go through life, it says, "I have no choice but to learn everything." I'm not saying it is impossible to learn everything about our complex world. But everything that you need to learn to do whatever it is that you want to do in life. Again, you have no choice but to learn everything. I think that's a good model for all of us. Okay, so now I'm jumping ahead. He realized, hey -- like his dad even said when he was younger, he's like, "Oh, I'm going to -- see the other plot of land for you. I'm going to -- saving that for you." Reminded me like of Henry Ford's early Life, where his -- part of the reason Henry Ford was so obsessed with like all things mechanical because he didn't want to be a farmer.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And same situation for Jim. Jim is like, "Dad, that's not -- like my goal is not -- in life not to be a sharecropper. Like, I don't want to be a dirt farmer." So he ends up moving away. He has no -- he graduated high school, but his parents never mention college to him. They even thought like most farmers in the area where he was out, thought high school was a waste of time because it took away from -- hours where you could be working on the farm, right? So this section where I'm at right now, it's going to talk about the difference a mentor could make in your life, right? And Jim's mentor when he's, let's say, a teenager, he's probably around 18 years old at the time, was this person named Bill. And Bill was the only person he knew that actually he had a college degree. And Jim is actually lucky in the sense because I think for a lot of people -- let me just speak for myself, and I think this applies for a lot of people like, I've never had like an in-person mentor. Never. Like I wish I did. I never did. For me, that's what I use like books and podcasts and thank God for the Internet because that can serve as like a mentorship, like at scale almost. So this is the influence that Bill had on Jim's life. So he says, "Bill asked me to consider applying for an electrical engineering degree at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville since they would accept all my credits from Memphis State." So he was going to like a tiny college. Then, he's going to wind up doing that. But then it says, "Bill also pushed me" -- they're working -- I forgot to tell you, they're working at a radio station, which was like I said, the budding technology of their day, eventually turns into TV stations, too. "Bill also pushed me to get my first-class radio license required by the FCC to operate and maintain transmitters at commercial television and high-powered radio stations. This, in particular, was a superb idea, as TV was sweeping the country, absorbing engineering talent." So he winds up studying. He not telling anybody but Bill this, right? So he winds up passing the exam from the FCC. And so he gets his license. He says, "This I thought would be my meal ticket. About the same time the University of Tennessee accepted my application. I packed the Chevy, left Memphis and moved 400 miles to Knoxville.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

On my first day there, armed with a fresh first-class license, I got a job as a transmitter operator for WNOX, a 10,000-watt radio station." So now I'm just looking at my notes, the difference a mentor could make. Encouraged him to go to college to study engineering. Advised him to get a license with the FCC to operate radio, TV stations. Go to UT so credits would transfer and you could work at the same time so you wouldn't have any debt. Those three things set Jim up to be able to move into business later on, which is going to happen relatively soon. But it's not at all clear and Jim doesn't know this if he would have naturally gone into that. He thinks he had some entrepreneurship tendencies at young age, but he was so interested in radio and television, he thought maybe him and his brother, would just work in the industry for the rest of their life. So that, to me, is like a story of the difference a mentor could make. And if you don't have a mentor that you can interact on a personal basis, please do try to find them through podcasts and books because they can function as -- they can -- and sometimes they could even be like -- that could produce like a better outcome for you, but I do think it is extremely important to have other people push you and shape the way you think. Around this time, Jim becomes fascinated with flying. And there's -- it's really funny because you could buy -- at this time, you could buy a plane. It was like a 65-horsepower, little two-seater for about $895. Well, Jim is in college, he doesn't have $895. So he comes up with this really good idea. He essentially invents fractional plane ownership before -- like a few decades before it actually becomes invented by another Buffett company that Buffett winds up buying. I think it's NetJets. It might be called like Marquis Jet or something like that now. But anyway, the lesson I'm about to tell you is he goes in, he convinces a bunch of his other fortune brothers, "Hey, let's" -- I think there's like eight of them or something like that. And he said, "Hey, let's all chip in $120 and buy this plane and then we'll all learn how to be pilots and get certified as pilots."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Now that's the story. That's not the lesson. The lesson is there's a strategy here that you should do the work others won't do, right? Everybody is like, "Yes, let's do it." They throw in money. Everybody is excited. Guess what happens? "The other guys were revved up at first. Later, they learned just how much work was required to obtain a pilot's license and didn't want to put in the time. Except for Joe" -- that's his brother, "none of them became pilots and only two of them ever took lessons." So they still paid for the plane, but they were lazy, and they were unwilling to do the work. Let me pull up my notes on this talk, this guy named Josh Wolfe gave, who's an investor and an entrepreneur advocate. And there's something he said that I wrote down and put in my collection of notes that I think about constantly. And I think I've talked about a few times on the podcast actually. So he talks about like what are the opportunities that this company is looking for. And he says, "We want really high scientific and technical complexity. Not because we want to tackle things that are really hard. It's because we don't want competition. The problem with funding and doing easy things is you get hundreds of competitors, and I'm psychotic about competitive advantage." What is Josh really saying there? He's indicting all of humanity. That humans all -- the vast majority of our species will drift to the easy. And as a result, you get hundreds of competitors, your profit margins whittled away and you just have a miserable time. He's saying, "It's not because we want to tackle hard things, right? We just do it because we know others won't." Now, he didn't say that. He said, "We don't want competition, but that's what he's saying. It's so hard that these people aren't going to do it." That is a strategy, do the work that others won't do. And this is -- this can be applied to business. But in this case, Jim is applying it to, hey, he's essentially got free access to a plane and he had to pay one-eighth of it because other people are like, "Oh, yes, I want to be a pilot. Oh, I got to study, I got to learn. I got to practice. Oh, okay. I'm not going to do it." But that's how humans react to so many things. And you can differentiate yourself and your business just by doing a little extra work.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It's like really how much work? It's just that most people will be happy just sitting at home doing nothing or not happy. They're definitely not happy doing that. Most people just do that because they're lazy, and they just don’t want -- they don't want to do the extra work. So again, I think that's a good strategy for all kinds of things in life. Do the work others won't do. So at 19 years old, he becomes a pilot, and he flies a lot. I don't -- by the time, -- I think now he's like in his 80s, so he might not be flying any more. But anyway, what I admire about Jim is he takes lessons about life from all the kind of activities he does. So he has this great section in the book that talks about the parallels of flying and running a business, and I just want to read this section to you. "The most difficult adjustment that you must make as you acquire flying skills is a willingness to believe that under certain conditions your senses can be dead wrong." And so Jim is picking up something from his experience that also -- there's this great talk by Paul Graham where he was talking about -- and he arrives at the same conclusion. Let me go back to my notes for that. So he talks about building companies is indeterminate. "What Y Combinator does is tell founders things that they will ignore. It's counterintuitive. We tell people don't hire too fast and they go off and hire too fast. And then they come back and say, I wish we listened. Start-ups are counterintuitive. Y Combinator wouldn't exist if it was obvious what to do." Same thing with flying. So Jim is going to elaborate here. That's what it means to be counterintuitive, your senses can be dead wrong. "If your business is in a deadly spiral and in a situation that takes more than just a course correction, it is even more imperative to resist the urge to rely on impulse." Same thing if you're in a deadly spiral in a plane. Something actually happens to him -- that actually happens to him. I think he talks about it here. "With so much negativity swirling around, realize that your sullen perception of things may not square with reality. Take action, yes, but knee-jerk bloodletting usually won't work.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Dramatic gestures like massive layoffs or cutting the advertising budget to zero could well add to the problem." So that's what it means. So that makes intuitive sense, but that might be the wrong thing. "During that horrific nosedive" -- now he's talking about -- he went into a cloud. And he didn't know that the plane winds up flying upside down because he couldn't see anything. So he's thinking that he's going -- like he feels his instincts are to pull back on like the handle and have the plane like gain altitude, but it winds up sending him faster towards the ground. He says, "During that horrific nosedive, I was desperately trying to recall fragments of information from the instruction manual that I had skimmed, something, anything that might get us through. I remembered one piece of advice pertinent to my situation. The last thing you should do, the book said, is the first thing you feel you should do." That's a great description of the word counterintuitive, right? The last thing you should do is the first thing you feel you should do. "In other words, during predicaments, when you are lost -- when you've lost all sense of direction, don't trust your senses. Don't act on impulse. Same with your business. If you've lost all sense of direction there, don't react on a whim. Instead, take your feelings out of the mix, gather all the data you can, analyze what you've got available, consult with your experts, engage your reliable sources and resources and identify the root cause of the problem through rational thinking, not raw passion. I know this advice almost against -- goes against -- almost goes against human nature. It's natural to respond instinctively, spontaneously and emotionally, but natural doesn't always mean desirable. Remember that cyanide, arsenic and earthquakes are also natural. Planning, organizing, controlling and delegating are unnatural to most of us, but that's what works in business. Successful organizations whether a Fortune 500 company or a mom-and-pop grocery store use these principles, either through education, experience or instinct, these companies tend to make these principles part of their culture. Shoot from the hip at your peril. You may wind up shooting yourself in the foot."

Okay, moving on. So he has -- it's really interesting how we can never predict the experiences we have in life, like, what role they'll play later on life. And so he's looking for -- he's in college. He's married. They don't have a lot of money. This is his first wife. And he winds up living in a mobile home, right? That becomes this main business. It's the business he sells to Warren. But he lived in a mobile home, not because he wanted to. He didn't even know anything about them, but because renting an apartment was so expensive. So through this experience, he learned some of the benefits of mobile homes -- of living in mobile homes. So he has to move cities. Now he's going back to University of Tennessee, and he says, "It was difficult leaving that great job, the charming city, but the process of moving itself wasn't difficult at all. We didn't have to move furniture or pack anything in boxes. Canned goods stayed in the cabinets, clothes stayed in the closet, socks and shorts stayed in the drawers, silverware stayed in its compartment. All it took was a little masking tape to make sure doors and drawers stayed shut and we were done." So they come. They hire a company. They lift the mobile home, put it on a truck and move it to Tennessee. Done. And he says that they moved in a day. "And by that night, we were cooking in the house." Now this is fascinating because something else that is not mentioned in -- I don't think I mentioned it later in the podcast, I'm just telling you, here, is the mobile home company he eventually founds is making $100 million a year after tax by the time -- and it was profitable for 28-plus years in a row by the time Warren Buffett buys the business. I just think the idea of having a company where you're making $100 million a year in profit after tax is nothing short of amazing. [0:31:53] So now I'm going to get to the point like before I read this book, I thought the entire book was going to be about that mobile home business, right? That's not -- he stumbles on the business by accident later and I'll get into that. His first business he stumbles on that, too, by accident. He's still in college, and he's a hustler. He's working weekends, off hours. He doesn't have a lot of money, so he's got tons of motivation. He's got two jobs and going to college, right? This guy is not sitting around loafing. He said, "I spent most of my weekends and off hours from my other two jobs in this manner." So let me -- before I jump ahead. So he winds up just like buying used cars because the lesson he learned from his dad was earlier, but then he starts reselling them by accident. He's like, "Wait a minute, I just made more from reselling this one car than I did from my two jobs, maybe I'm stumbling on to something." So this is how he starts the car dealership. So he says, "In a few weeks, I was making more money on a good week selling cars than I was at my other two jobs combined. Soon I was thinking, wouldn't it be great if I could sell more than one car at a time? I partnered with Joe and six other fraternity brothers. They became my first sales team. This cookie-cutter approach to the car business worked better than I could have ever imagined. Some of these guys sold a car every week. It wasn't long before our gross profit was $6,000 a month. My net was about $2,000, good money for almost anyone then, but especially for a kid in his early 20s." So his business is growing. And now here's the issue, right? So this section really explains us the benefit of the power of thinking outside the box. He's in a commoditized industry. He's selling used cars. So he's got to figure out how can my business stand out. And at the time, TV stations are relatively new and they had -- not all like -- all hours of the day had programming so you could buy programming if you'd produce your own show. So you buy it from -- you like buy the time from the network essentially. And so he buys -- he starts -- he's really into music. He's a musician. He does like this talent show. And he puts it on, and this is a lesson he learnt from earlier because he would sell advertising for other shows. He's like, "Well, I don't need to sell advertising like my auto dealer show will be the advertiser. I just need to make the show."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so -- and then he appears on camera and he sings country songs, and he does like -- what are they called, jingles for his -- like just goofy little jingles and it works. He said, "It caught on. People kidded me about being the singing car salesman. It was fun and more successful than the radio spots." That's how we previously advertised his business. "Once again, I learned the power of thinking outside the box. Sure, it's easy to copy the competition. But doing business like everyone else means you'll get results like everyone else, which is usually average. For me, that's completely unacceptable. After appearing night" -- and then he picks up something about human nature, that people will buy products from people they like. "After appearing night after night in their living rooms, even from inside an electric box, people felt like they knew me. I mean, really knew me. Like I had a personal relationship with them. They'd walk into the dealership and say, 'Where's Jim?' I was like an old friend. Because of TV, they trusted me. And if you're selling something, that's as good as it gets. I can't begin to overstate how much credibility those television commercials gave us." And this whole idea about the value a business can have is if your customers trust you and that's again something straight out of Buffett and -- the school of Buffett and Munger. They talk about, "I don't care if you lose money. I care if you damage your business reputation because that's way more valuable." And they tell that to all the CEOs that they manage. Jim also picks up on something that, again, is something that could have easily come out of the mouth of Charlie Munger, among others. Munger compares economies to ecosystems. So Jim says, "Seize a niche that's underserved and own the market." Munger would say, hey, the economies are like ecosystems, just like some -- and there's wildlife that have dominated a niche for survival, companies that find an underserved niche and dominate that can find, he called it, like positive economics that they wouldn't find otherwise. [0:35:58] So again, seize a niche that's underserved and own that market. So they have a lot of success selling used cars. He winds up getting contracts with a lot of -- becomes a dealer for new cars. At this time in history, like the new Volkswagen Beetles are like all the rage. So he starts selling for Volkswagen, but he does something in like a gray market, which is really weird. I never heard about it before, where Volkswagen would have like, I guess, like normal relationships with dealers -- like authorized relationships with dealers, but they would still sell to gray marketers, and that's what his business was at this time. Eventually becomes like an authorized dealer with them and Volvo and other companies. But anyway, the main Volkswagen dealership is run by this family called the Snyders in Knoxville. And they did some things that were like unfriendly to their employee -- to their customers, which is really, really dumb. So this section, it's going to tell us to ignore your competition and focus all your attention on your customer. So what the Snyders would do is there's so much demand for Beetles like they would work like a half a day on Saturday. They'd be closed on Sunday. They would make -- they would try to drum up demand by making their -- there'd be like -- let's say you wanted to walk into the Snyder dealership and buy a Volkswagen Bug that day, you wouldn't be able to get it for like six months. So again, this is just -- I know some businesses do this to like increase prices and stuff, but it's fundamentally unfriendly to your customers. So I think that's just ridiculous. And then what happened is Volkswagen selling these gray market even though they're the same new Volkswagen Beetles, but they're selling them to other dealerships, which is weird business practice themselves. And so the Snyders are really, really mad at Jim and his brother. So it says -- so now instead of going to Snyders, you can go to Jim and you wouldn't have to wait. He says, "Unlike the Snyders, we didn't make our customers wait. In fact, our customers could buy a Volkswagen and drive it off the lot that very day. For that, they'd gladly pay the extra $300." So he's actually selling them for $300 more than the Snyders are, and he is selling more -- and he starts outselling the Snyders because of that. [0:38:03] Humans are impatient. They're going to wind up paying more if they can access whatever product you have they want in advance or faster than they otherwise could. Now, what happened is the Snyders make a huge mistake here. They start running and spending all this advertising money warning the public to beware of gray market Volkswagens, but it's the same product. So they spent -- and what happens is Jim winds up benefiting from his competitors' ad spend. So the competitor made a mistake. The competitor, the Snyders, should have focused on being better to their customers instead of looking at their competition. "Publicly, they retaliated in the News-Sentinel." That's the newspaper in the area they are in. "With enormous ads and a headline that bellowed, 'Beware of gray market Volkswagens.' What followed was a litany of warnings indicating the mishaps that would befall the buyer foolish enough to purchase a Beetle from the evil, conniving gray marketer. This was free advertising for us. Readers couldn't help but wonder what the heck a gray market Volkswagen was. They'd check us out, just to satisfy their curiosity. Unwittingly, the Snyders became excellent promoters for us. The more they ran those ads, the more beetles we sold. A top-flight New York ad agency with a blank check couldn't have gotten us more publicity. It is never smart to shine a light on your competitor, not even candlelight. Okay, so I'm fast-forwarding in the story. Just know that his dealership is a massive success at this point. He's selling for all different kinds of brands. Him and his brother are making a ton of money, and it's all going to blow up. And so he's learning the danger of leverage. And the messed up part was it wasn't even really his mistake. He winds up switching his business because a lot -- obviously customers come in, they have to -- they need to finance. Cars are a large purchase for most people.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He switches to a younger banker and that banker is trying to make a lot of money, and they do so by essentially like cooking the books and giving people credit that shouldn't have got the credit. And this is happening in the 60s. And we know that continues happening today and will always happen. It's just part of human nature. Now, here's the problem though. That bank wasn't only doing it for Jim's dealership, they were doing it for all kind of other businesses. So eventually, they realize, "Oh, s_*_. All of our -- a lot of our loans are going to -- are default. We have to cut this business off immediately." And because they loan the money, they can also call in the loans immediately and that was in the contract. And so let me read this section to you, and then we're going to talk about Jim's unique response to this. Just remember while I'm reading this, that Jim was encouraged by the bank to use leverage to grow faster. One bank was like, no, no, we can't extend anymore, like grow slowly. The other bank was like, yes, fast, fast, fast. He went with the fast one because he's young. He's like 20 -- I think 25 and that winds up being his downfall. He becomes bankrupt here in a minute. All right. Tom is his banker. "With Tom's liberal financing for our customers and his generous funding of increased inventory, our sales increased every month. True, our overhead with a larger inventory and a staff of 70 was also growing." Remember, he was taught to watch his cost. He did not adhere to that. "The year 1960, with the larger staff and Tom's financing was for Clayton" -- it's called -- that's the name of his company at the time, "a great year. The coming year would be a blowout for sure, we thought. But by the spring of 1961, a rumor that Tom's department -- there was a rumor that Tom's department had been audited. The audit turned up irregularities, something about high delinquency and a poor loan documentation." So he comes back from this trip and his brother picks him up from the airport. He's over in like Sweden or wherever Volvo is at. And they give him awards for selling so many Volvos. He feels like he's on top of the world. Comes back that day, Tom -- not Tom, Joe, is his brother, picks him up, and it looks like somebody died. And why?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"'The bank is demanding immediate payment of all principal and interest, all $275,000 of it today.' It wasn't possible. It didn't make sense. We weren't behind on any payments of the bank. We never had been." So they wind up going to a meeting. They bring two of their attorneys, like, "All right. We're going to straighten this out. The bank can't do it to us." They sit in with Tom, and then Tom is the nephew of the bank President, this guy named Harry Nacey, who's kind of a – who's just an a and you're going to see why because this is what he says right here. "The meeting was a disaster, a Hindenburg blowing up in our faces. They began -- his attorneys had begun telling the bank's veteran attorneys and Harry Nacey what they could and could not do. It was not going well." Now he talks about Harry Nacey. "He listened for a while. And then he suddenly looked at his watch and announced he had to be at the Cherokee Country Club in 20 minutes, and then Nacey said something that made my blood run cold. Let's bankrupt these little SOBs. I can't be late for my tennis match. The meeting was over. The bank had made a lot of bad loans. The bank regulators found bookkeeping and accounting records that were badly flawed and loan files that contained inaccurate information. Harry Nacey and his Board of Directors decided to terminate relationships with all of their indirect dealers, car, boat, furniture, appliance, piano and more. In hand, they had a court order, bankruptcy papers and the authority to take over all of our assets. When we arrived back at the dealership, we saw the bank was hellbent on taking everything, which would wipe out the business -- this business that we worked so hard to grow." Now, there's going to be two things that Jim does here is remarkable and very abnormal. One, the next day he gets up, he says, "All right. We just got to start another dealership." They have a bankruptcy attorney. He's like, "Well, that company is bankrupt, but you guys aren't personally bankrupt. So you could start another company." And that's what they do. So this section I'm going to talk to you about is the tactics used to start another smaller dealership while in bankruptcy, right? They do something really, really smart here. They're like, okay, and they do it -- make sure it's legal first. They check with their attorney.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But the bank confiscates all their assets, right? Well, what do the banks do when they do that? They don't keep them. They auction them off. So Jim and his brother, they have to hustle. They have to sell -- like they borrow some money from friends and family. They had some cars that were in their personal names they were able to sell because only their car dealership was bankrupt, not them. So they go to these auctions and they buy back their old inventory for more than 50% off. And then that's not only the one unique interesting thing they do. So it says -- talks about -- the bankers were there. "They were there at the first of three bank auctions featuring some very familiar merchandise. Representatives from the" -- it says we were there, sorry. "Representatives from the bank were there, too, obviously, displeased and speculating as to what sinister scheme might be afoot. As we won bid after bid, you could practically see jaws drop as they watched us -- those poor, bankrupted souls -- buy back our own inventory at bargain prices. By selectively bidding at the three auctions, we bought about 50 cars and were amazed at some of the prices. The average price paid for the cars was a little over $800." Now how did -- so they borrowed some money, but not enough to buy 50 cars. So he says, "Now you may be asking after performing some quick arithmetic just how we could buy 50 cars plus parts, tools and supplies with a relatively small amount of cash?" Here's the second really smart thing they do. "Simple, we presold a lot of those cars and paid for them with the buyers' own money. Think about it. We knew the condition of the cars that the bank had on the block and precisely what they were worth. There was nothing wrong with contacting potential buyers to explain how they could buy a good car and save a bundle, and we took their cash to make a purchase for them at a reasonable profit for us. Those reasonable profits added up." Now in addition to that, the third thing he does that I would say is uncommon and also smart, he gets a job while doing this. "I went back to radio. This WROL hired me a station's Chief Engineer and the host of yet another Saturday morning program.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The base pay was $125 a week plus commissions on any advertising I sold. The Saturday show gave me a chance to promote the business, good publicity for change and the salary was enough to allow me to forgo taking any salary out of the new business." And so I think that story just illustrates Jim's like modus operandi like, "Okay, I have a problem. Let me think rationally and not emotionally how to solve that problem and just go and do that. He also applies it to, I referenced this earlier, "If there's something I don't know, that's fine. I'll go learn it." And so what is the lesson -- the unique lesson, he took from being bankrupted because he didn't understand the power that the bank had. He says, "Certainly, I was getting a lesson in what can happen to a small business if the owner does not have adequate legal experience, and I swore that I would never be in that situation again. The bankruptcy fiasco made it clear that there were some huge gaps in my knowledge. I wanted to learn the law. In the fall of 1961, I went back to the University of Tennessee, this time to law school." That's just amazing. All right. So fast forward, he learned his lesson. Now, he understands -- like he reads and actually drafts a lot of the contracts that he gets into and they wind up controlling the cost and not like overleveraging themselves. So he says, "Just two years after the bankruptcy, our cash" -- this is the new dealership, "our cash flow credit and credibility were against satisfactory but now, in fact, we operated with all bills paid current, no exceptions." Now, they were making enough money. He said, "We could have bought big houses and luxury cars or became jet-setters with frequent jaunts to Europe or Hawaii, but we didn't. Our lifestyles were so modest that I wouldn't even drive a clean car off the lot for the drive home from work. I wanted clean cars on display and available for our customers. So I drive the latest dirty trade-in even one that was a little beat up. We were not prone to spending sprees, preferring to keep the purse strings tight.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

To sum it up, if we considered expenditure didn't support the business, we'd be taking a long, hard look before approval. Cash was king as it is now." And again, you could see -- just picture Warren reading those words and nodding along and like, "I'm going to buy this guy's business." Now I want to refer you back to his experience living in a mobile home. That's interesting. Now I want to flash forward about a decade from that time period, right? He's got -- him and his brother are making tons of money with their car dealerships. Everything seems to be fine. And this is how a daily traffic jam caused Jim to stumble into the mobile home business. So there's a mobile home reseller across the highway that their auto dealership is on. And it's these guys called the Taylors. I think they are brothers too. And he says, "They were delivering so many mobile homes that they caused a traffic snarl on Clinton Highway almost every morning with their deliveries." And then this is Jim's inner monologue. He says, "This happens every day, darn guys. And I hear they make a couple of thousand bucks every time they sell one. Ten times of what we make when we sell a car. Every time I see one of those big things pass me on the road, they've made a couple of grand. And I see it every day. That mobile home business must be really good." So how does he get started in mobile -- he has this idea. He is like, "Well, let me just" -- baby steps. Every big company starts out a small company, every great company starts out as a small company. And so he does the exact same thing that he did when he was starting to sell cars. He just tried to sell one. Just one. I don't need to scale. I don't even need to worry about selling thousands or whatever the case is. I'm going to see if I could sell one. So he scans the classifieds. He says, "While scanning the classifieds, an ad for a used mobile home caught my eye. It was 10 x 56, like new, the ad went on to say. Stated that it had a small kitchen fire. I began to wonder if this little burnt-out home could be fixed up. If so, maybe we could sell it for a little profit. And if it worked, who knows, maybe we can make a few hundred dollars in the mobile home business too. Who would have thought that, that little burnt-out -- that this little burn-out mobile home would take us to #1 in the market share in several years.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I bought it for $1,200 and I called in the troops, mom and dad. The three of us started to work on the damaged but repairable home. We spent two days and another $800 to redo the kitchen, repaint the ceiling and replace the carpet." Remember, this is happening right by his auto dealership. There's tons of people that drive on this road and he put an ad out saying for sale. "Someone driving by saw our 'For Sale' sign and stopped. They bought the home for $4,500. Profit after delivery was $2,000, not bad. I was on to something." All right. So from there, he starts buying more, then he visits dealers, and he just -- now he has a full-fledged mobile home business, right? And at this point, he is not vertically integrated. We're going to get there. Right now, he is just reselling other homes that are manufactured by other businesses. But the problem was he's spending so much time. He's still got a car dealership. Actually, they have -- like they have more than one at this time. So this is what allowed Jim to focus solely on homes. And it was a unique reason, and then I'm going to talk more about some unique reasons for his success. He says, "By early 1968, I was spending zero time supporting Joe at the car dealership. Clayton Homes was eating my clock, and I have to admit I was loving it. In June, Joe and I stopped for a beer after work and held the big meeting to formalize the role that we had both been playing very capably. The conversation lasted almost a full five minutes. Mr. President, 'It looks like you're running cars,' I said to Joe. 'Sure, looks that way,' he said, with a sly half-smile. 'Okay, you run cars and I run homes.' So there's actually two important things here. One is the benefit of having a good relationship with your business partner. At this point, it's his brother. They've never had a fight in their lives. They just handle things very, like, easily and simple. Even the breaking up of the two businesses was handled in like a one-page contract. And two, it's not at all clear that without the success of the car dealerships that Clayton Homes would have ever been as successful because he was able to dedicate several years to working on the home business while also reaping the benefits of a successful car dealership.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

In fact, that car dealership, I think, it's still family-owned. I think they've been in the family for like 50 years. And Jim says that. He says, "Make no mistake, all 8,000 of us who get our paychecks from Clayton Homes should never forget that our organization wouldn't exist if not for the dealerships run by Joe and later by his children. It was during this period that both" -- now I'm getting into some of the unique reasons for the success that he was having. "It was during this period that both our car and home divisions began a dramatic surge in growth." We're talking late 60s, early 70s now. "There were lots of reasons for our success, a highly trained and aggressive staff. A state-of-the-art accounting system, a wonderful way to promote the business." That's his weekly TV show. "A booming and stable economy, particularly good in our area, customer financing that was convenient and quick and attractive pricing, a strategic decision made possible because our two companies shared much of the overhead costs. No questions. Those wildly successful five years gave us momentum to build a lasting foundation and launched a unique concept that has produced results unequaled in the industry." So now Jim moves into the point he's like I'm going to -- there's nobody else that's completely vertically integrated in the mobile home industry. I'm going to make the first of that move. So he's going to go from a retailer to a full-fledged manufacturer, right? And this is again what I mean about, "Okay, well, other people figured out how to build and manufacture mobile homes, like I can learn how to do that, too." And it's a slow process. I don't want to like misrepresent this. Like it took six years for the manufacturing division of Clayton Homes to be profitable. But once that happened, then he can move into other areas, and we'll get there. So he says -- it's just a funny story, I want to share with you. "The factory is only big enough to construct three mobile homes at the same time." Everything starts small. "We quickly created a crude assembly line and adopted, unintentionally, the trial-and-error approach. One early lesson learned, always make sure the size of the finished product is smaller than the doorway.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The first home we made was 12 feet wide, but the door was 11 feet and 10 inches. We had to knock out the wall, which didn't please our landlord, then spent two days and hundreds of dollars building a larger door. Over the years, we've had a lot of laughs about this, but at this time, it wasn't funny at all. The homes we made were simple, cheap and sold even before they were off the assembly line. Our retail price was $3,995, a little lower than the rest of the industry. Our customers saved significantly on freight costs. The hundreds of dollars" -- there's another benefit of the trial-and-error process. Their factory or whatever you want to call this -- I guess, their factory was local. So it says, "Our customers saved significantly on freight costs, the hundreds of dollars normally paid to move the homes from the factory to the dealership. Instead, this was credited to our customers since we were building the homes locally, just blocks away from the sales center, and there were no freight-to-dealer costs." Now, this is where Jim goes vertical, and this is extremely important because there's no way in hell that Warren Buffett would have bought just a company that manufactures mobile homes. It's because they become -- well, let me just -- it's remarkable how much money they start making. Over half their income comes from the financial aspect of the mobile home industry. So he says, "We began at the retail level, selling homes produced by other companies. We served our customers and shareholders very well in that one level." Okay, so that's one lesson there. You can't just -- like it's smart, it's this incremental approach. One, can we sell? We did that good. Okay. "Then with a huge step back, we began to design and manufacture from scratch the homes we wanted to sell." Then, they did that well. Now they moved to the third part of the integration. "Owning and operating mobile home communities took us to a third level. Now, we're providing our customers with quality sites for their homes and an attractive lifestyle for their families."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Then, they start their own insurance company. And if you listened to my podcast on Warren Buffett shareholder letters you realize that insurance is their main business. It's something that they love to do because of the float, which is money that they do not own, but money that they can invest. It's all the money paid upfront from insurance premiums. So it says -- now they start this company Vanderbilt Life. It's part of Clayton Homes. "Since we started Vanderbilt Life and our customers were offered home, lifestyle and extended warranty programs with their home purchase. With this toe in the water, we were slowly entering into the fourth level. Little did we know that soon the tail would wag the dog. At the time, financing was a byproduct of selling homes. Our emphasis in income was primarily sales. Over the next three decades, financial services, mortgages and insurance would become the larger source of income, dwarfing even that of manufacturing and retail. Owning the insurance company provides significant income for us. Shifting our mortgage company into high gear would take us to our fifth level of service or to look at it another way, our company would realize five levels of income with just one product." Okay, now I want to skip to the end because the rest of the book is about him running the company, selling it to Warren Buffett. He winds up starting -- he has like a -- he starts to have another career where he buys a bunch of banks. If you want the full story, obviously, read the book. If you go to amazon.com/shop/founderspodcast, you can buy this book. And if you're treating this podcast like a book club and you want to see the book I'm working on next week and read it along with me, you can go to amazon.com/shop/founderspodcast, and you'll see it there. But I think he has another -- before I close, I want to -- there's another lesson that we can take away. It's a universal human lesson. And he says, "For me, starting is the hard part of writing and I always procrastinate. However, when I finally get started, it flows fast and I enjoy the process. After all, it's good therapy to pause and reflect back on your life.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It seems I do more of that nowadays. Where did the time go? How did I get to the age 65 so fast? It seems only yesterday that I sold an old car through a classified ad from that fraternity house. That was in 1953. That endeavor led to a tiny car lot on Clinton Highway, where with the help of my brother, Joe, our company began in 1956. Wow, that doesn't seem like 46 years ago. I still have dreams. I dream that I'm 90 years old, still playing tennis with my wife and enjoying my grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The real journey never ends. You never get there. Perhaps that's the way it should be. You see it's not where you wind up that's so important. It's what you did along the way, the lives you touched, the work you did, the people you loved and the dreams you lived." And almost every time I read an autobiography of an entrepreneur, the same thing happens. They don't write it until they're older, near the end of the life, and they all say the same thing that it goes by fast. Don't waste your time is the last lesson I learned from Jim. All right. Before I let you go, I just want to tell you an added benefit that I just added to the Misfit, which is like the member program for this podcast. First of all, in case you don't know the Misfit Feed, I give half of my podcasts away -- the ones I create away for free. The other half are exclusively for my paid podcast feed, which I call the Misfit Feed. But a few years ago, I started taking detailed notes from every podcast or lecture on entrepreneurship that I listen to. And I've collected notes on over 250 talks since. So I constantly refer back to these notes as a way to remember what I learn and apply those losses to my daily of life. You've heard me when I was quoting people like Josh Wolfe and Marc Andreessen in this podcast that was happening in my browser on my computer by just typing the name and looking for the note real quick. So now what I'm going to do is Misfits will have access to all of the notes I've ever taken in the past and the ones that I take in the future.

And you have it, what it is, is the read-only access to an Evernote notebook. So if it's -- so if you use Evernote, you can just -- the notebook, then you can use the notebook inside Evernote, but you don't have to have Evernote because I send you the link. And in your browser, then you have access to every single one of my notes that you can search and look through and you see my additional highlights and everything else. So Misfits will have access to all the notes that I've taken in the past and the ones I will take in the future. And the best part is that you get lifetime access to my growing list of notes from the podcast and lectures I listen to. To access the link, all you have to do is when you sign up for the Misfit Feed, it's going to be in the show notes starting with last week's Misfit. To do that -- now you're asking, well, how do I do that, David? To do that, all you have to do is tap the link that I left in your show notes. You can get access -- You can access the link directly on your podcast player. But if you don't want to do that, you can always go to founderspodcast.com, and you'll see something in the header that says something like support Founders podcast and get all the premium episodes. It takes less than 30 seconds to sign up, and you'll be listening to all of the exclusive, wonderful, amazing Misfit episodes available nowhere else. Thank you very much for listening. I will talk to you next week.

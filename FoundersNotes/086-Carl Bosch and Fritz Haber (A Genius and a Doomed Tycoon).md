Okay. So that is an excerpt from the book that I read this week, and the one I'm going to talk to you about today, which is the Alchemy of Air: A Jewish genius, a Doomed Tycoon and the Scientific Discovery That Fed the World but Fueled the Rise of Hitler, and it was written by Thomas Hager. So this is one of the most unique, complicated, engrossing stories I've ever read. I couldn't put the book down. It's like 300 pages long, and I read it in two days. And something happened to me, so I'm going to jump into the book in a minute, but I got to tell you what happened to me, which is unusual. This is the third try of me attempting to record this podcast. And the first two -- and I guess the odd thing is that I'm kind of nervous and I'm not usually nervous, and I couldn't figure out why, like why did I start recording two other podcasts and then stopped because it just didn't sound right, it didn't feel right. And I think it's because there's so much going on in this book that I don't know if I'm good enough to -- like to do the book justice. So I figured, you know what, let me just tell you that right up front, and hopefully, I'm able to create a podcast that you learn from and you actually enjoy, but I am nervous. I don't like that feeling.

“This is the story of 2 men who invented a way to turn air into bread, built factories the size of small cities, made enormous fortunes, helped engineer the deaths of millions of people, and saved the lives of billions more. Their work stands, I believe, as the most important discovery ever made. See if you can think of another that ranks with it in terms of life and death importance for the largest number of people. Most people do not know the names of either the men or their invention. Their work lives today in the form of giant factories, usually located in remote areas that drink rivers of water, inhale oceans of air, and burn about 1% of all the Earth's energy. If all the machines these men invented were shut down today, more than 2 billion people would starve to death. Carl Bosch led me into this story. I learned quickly that he was a man of contradictions, a business mogul who won a Nobel Prize, and an ardent anti-Nazi who founded and led a most infamous Nazi firm. Bosch is one of the great mystery men of the 20th century. He kept a very low public profile, avoided meetings, seemed to prefer machines to people, and hid away as much as possible in his villa, which he turned into a private playground equipped with personal laboratories, museum-quality collections, and a research-grade astronomical observatory. Fritz Haber who was as public as Bosch was private, a scientist who reveled in attention, sought glory, drank, smoked, partied, hobnobbed with royalty, and love making an impression in his hand-tailored military uniform, but he too had his mysteries. How could a man who helped feed the world also be attacked as a war criminal after World War I? What was he doing in a secret laboratory hidden on an ocean liner? These men were giants of science. Their careers took off after their invention of the air-to-bread machine, and they both attempted even bigger things. They pioneered new ways of doing science, built city-sized factories, controlled world markets, and made life-or-death decisions. Haber and Bosch are, in many ways, responsible for creating the modern chemical industry”.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So let me -- before I jump into the book, the entire -- I guess, some background because Thomas Hager, the author does this fantastic job where he introduces us in the introduction to what he's writing about, and then he doesn't talk about Fritz or Bosch, who are the two main characters in the book for 60 pages, and instead, he gives us this like riveting history of why the process that they came up with, which is called the Haber-Bosch process was so important, and why without it -- it’s especially responsible for half of the world's food production. So what you need to know about the Haber-Bosch process is it's an artificial nitrogen fixation process. And it's a way to turn the nitrogen in the air into ammonia, that ammonia is used for fertilizer. And the main reason that Fritz Haber created the process, and Bosch winds up being the one who implemented it into like the factories like production, is to solve -- like to solve the problem of how do you feed your own population from a government perspective. Now, what they didn't know or maybe they knew at the time, but it was quickly weaponized because the same thing that makes fertilizer good for -- fertilizer is good for creating crops and making like each acre of agriculture more -- like yield more food, but it's also like integral to war and to explosives. So that's why the subtitles like it's a scientific discovery, it’s fed the world, which is great, but it also directly fueled the rise of Hitler. And in the book, it talks about that without this invention, there's a good chance that Hitler would have been destroyed in a few weeks instead of being able to wreak havoc for several years. All right. So let me jump into the book, and I think I'll elaborate more on that. I got a bunch of notes as normal, and maybe even more so than normal because I just absolutely love this book.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So let me start with first the book’s why. And so before we even get into -- before the invention is even made, the author takes us to this lecture that's given by this guy named Crookes. He's like a really popular scientist. And we're in the year 18 -- I think we're in the year 1898 right now. So he's giving this talk, and he is saying, “Hey, much of Europe doesn't have a way to feed the population, like the population is going to grow too fast, if we don't find another source, like people are going to starve to death”. So he's at a -- he's giving a lecture to like the -- like most preeminent scientists of the day, and he's trying to have like basically a call to arms. So I'm going to pick it up right there, and he says, “He ended by calling his fellow researchers to action. The only answer he said was to find a way to make synthetic fertilizers, fixed nitrogen, refining it from the earth's greatest reservoir of nitrogen, the atmosphere”. That's why they say the machine can turn air into bread. “Other scientific discoveries might make life easier, might help build wealth, might add luxury or convenience, but this was a necessary discovery, the vital discovery. The discovery of a way to fix atmospheric nitrogen was a matter of life and death. The entire population of the world needed fixed nitrogen. Whoever found a way to create it out of the air would not only save humanity, but would likely become very, very rich”. So it says between those two points, between Crookes’ dire warning and today's global epidemic of obesity, a discovery of unprecedented importance saved the world from starving. This is the story of that discovery. So that's the book’s why. And it's also why in the introduction the author says he's like, can you think -- see if you can think of another invention that ranks with like -- can you think of another invention that's not -- is this -- like how can you say this is not the most important discovery of all -- ever made.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

If you calculate it by sheer numbers of people impacted by this. So right around the time that Crookes is giving this call to action, the global population is something like 1.6 billion. And because of this discovery, this invention created by Haber and then obviously put into production by Bosch, our -- the human population has gone up. It's around a little over 7 billion, if I'm not mistaken, today. So there's just this random sentence that I want to pull out because I think this is what we're all doing here. This is something that's -- it's like why the – this entire point of me making this podcast is probably the point of you listening to the podcast, but it's also a desire, like an innate human desire that's seen throughout history. And it talks about like why do people like to learn? Why are they doing research? Why are they performing experience -- experiments rather? And it says, “They all wanted to understand how the world works and to use that knowledge to make human lives easier, safer, and more rewarding”. Okay. So now, I need to go back, and we're going to go -- we started, let's say, right around 1900 in the story. We're going to go back to the 1840s. And I needed to give you some history. I almost thought about making this like a standalone short episode. Now, it’s like, you know what, it makes more sense. And I was thinking about putting it at the end of this episode. I was like let me just include it because I think the story is fascinating. It's the short history of one of the world's oddest industries. And it kind of gives us a good idea of why -- like why there was so much pressure at this time. I want you to understand what's the place -- why there's so much pressure at this time to find an alternative. And so it's going to start with, “South American nitrate was a good fertilizer. Fast-growing and increasingly hungry European nations during the Industrial Revolution fixed their attention to the place where there were mountains of the most perfect and powerful natural fertilizer ever found”.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“So during the 20 years from 1840s to the 1960s” -- now this is one of the craziest sentences in the book, “It fueled national economies, determined foreign policy, caused a war, and earned a lasting reputation of the world's oddest industries”. So what we're talking about here is guano. And if you don't know what guano is, it's bat and bird s_*_, and it's used -- it's -- fertilizer is so potent and natural -- it was estimated like 30x more powerful than like the synthetic fertilizers available. Okay. So where was this industry? It was like this is the world's oddest industry. Where did it take place? It's in South America. It starts on this little chain of islands off the coast of Peru. And so let's pick that up right here. It says, “These were the Chincha Islands, a sprinkling of rocks six miles off the coast of Peru.” And this is another crazy sentence, “Which constituted in 1850 acre for acre the most valuable real estate on earth. The value came from the ground, the workers and the birds walked on, 10 stories of guano, the world's best fertilizer. So you got 100 feet of guano. So it talks about like the Peruvian government. They imported a bunch of Chinese laborers. And when -- the book goes into detail. I'm only going to hit some highlights here, but essentially, they were like slave laborers. And this is the living conditions that the guano was harvested. So the workers lived, “Almost naked under the tropical sun, and they had no days of rest. They survived on two small meals a day, up to a quarter of the workforce at any given time would be too sick to work. Scurvy was common.” Another thing that was common, the book talks about this thing called “guano handling illness”.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I mean think about it, you're essentially shoveling bird excrement all day. And so this unidentified disease or illness, you have like a shortness of breath, you’d cough up blood, you'd have cramps, you'd vomit, you'd have diarrhea. So they kept having -- they basically rotate out their entire workforce because at any given time a fourth of them were down with this disease. And so -- and it's something to realize is the guano that they're working on extracting at this point in human history was more valuable than gold. And they called the Guano Boom. Guano was the best of all possible manures. It was like a necessity to us, for the British farmer. It was an all but indispensable fertilizer. U.S. expert estimated that it was 35x more powerful. So I was actually wrong. 30 -- I said 30, I think, earlier. 35x more powerful than standard manure at the time. So what happens? It's discovered, the Peruvians are extracting it from this tiny chain of islands, and they're shipping it everywhere. It's going to America. It's going to Europe. It's going to Asia. And as a result, just like in the gold rush, there's a huge boom, and they create vast fortunes really fast, but we're going to see something that we see over and over again in these books is that human nature -- history doesn’t repeat, human nature does. So it says, “The Peruvian leaders used the enormous income as collateral to leverage (there's that word again) foreign loans fueling a brief gilded age”, and then all of a sudden, it was over, and it says, “And then it was over. By the late 1850s, the workers on the Chinchas began to hit rock”. Checkout, this is another crazy sentence. “The deposits of thousands of years had been stripped away in less than 2 decades”. Okay. So now, Peru is in a bit of a pickle here. And so is everybody else that was relying on this. And the United States was one of those countries that desperately needed the guano to feed their population.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this led to something I've never heard of and one of the craziest laws that the U.S. Congress has ever had to pass. And it says, “The need was so great that in 1856 the U.S. Congress passed the Guano Islands Act, which allowed any U.S. citizen to lay claim to any deserted guano Island anywhere in the world and make it U.S. territory”. What? The law essentially deputized all Americans to claim land in their nation's name as an act that is no parallel in history. Okay. So now, the guano deposits were gone. There's a worldwide search for an alternative source for fertilizers. You need it to, obviously, grow crops. And there is a -- this is going to cause a war between Peru and Chile and -- because they find these like salt deposits, these nitrate deposits in this area called the Atacama, and there's a dispute between who actually owns the land, and this turns out to be like this giant war. Chile winds up winning, and Peru is like devastated. But real quick, let me just give you some background. It says, “The fact that Atacama nitrates could be used for both food and war made it in the latter half of the 19th century one of the world's most valuable natural resources”. So any time you have a valuable natural resource in human history, you're going to have a violent conflict that is going to occur to see who's going to actually control that very valuable natural resource. The author does a fantastic job. I had never heard of this story before. So I thought it was great. If you are a history buff, definitely go ahead and read the book because I'm going to skip over much of that, but he gives in great detail the naval battle that happens between Chile and Peru and all the crazy stuff that happens. Chile's victory was total, although that's the important part that you need to know. So now the industry switches from Peru to Chile. And then eventually, this -- they're going to -- it's going to -- Chile is going to be superseded by the invention that Fritz Haber makes in Germany.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it said, “What ended Chile's nitrate age was not shortage, but plenty”, and not plenty from Chile. It says, “Half a world away, a German chemist (this is Fritz Haber) was channeling his anger into perfecting a machine that would within 30 years bring down the entire Chilean industry. The man was Fritz Haber, the machine he was working on could turn air into bread”. Okay. So now, I want to tell you a little bit about Fritz's work habits, where his work started. and then we'll get into like his early life, so we can get you some background. So it says, “It’s always the same thing. Fritz Haber got excited and anxious and eager and intensely productive, and then his stomach tied in knots, and he had trouble sleeping. He grew short-tempered. He called it nerves. About once a year, the anxiety increased to a point where he could take -- where he could no longer focus effectively and had to take time off”. So he'd have to go -- he’d take a few weeks at a sanatorium or a spa. He just basically had to relax because he worked himself to the bone. “Haber had done his original ammonia work for an Austrian company that wanted to find a profitable way to take nitrogen, which is in the air and costs nothing, and use it to make ammonia, which could be sold”. And so the important thing to remember here is that this idea was not a new idea. People had -- knew that there was a large amount of -- effectively an endless supply of fixed nitrogen in the atmosphere. They just couldn't figure out how to change it into ammonia to actually use as fertilizer. So people were playing around in this -- and experimenting in this -- like trying to solve this problem for a few decades before Fritz was able to do so. Because obviously, as the book said in the beginning, like if you could figure this out, you're taking something that's free and making and turning into something that is so valuable that people like -- human life literally depends on it.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it logically follows that, oh my god, I'm going to be able to print money if I am able to do this, and they actually do print money. All right. So let's go back to Fritz's early life, give an idea of who this person was and maybe why like he was such a -- he was such a bizarre person, like everybody that we study is. “His mother died a week after giving birth”. Haber was raised by his father, a successful manufacturer who is rarely idle, rarely around the house, and it seems rarely satisfied with his son. “Fritz grew into an impatient and insecure young man, and he devoted to proving himself and eager to gain acceptance and achieving high positions”. So this trait that we're seeing in his early childhood maybe stem from some kind of like psychological -- like suffering at the hands of his father never went away. And it goes from his father to other scientists to eventually the German government that he was kind of like slavishly devoted to. So this is one aspect of his personality that I would not try to emulate. You can learn from it, yes. There's some kind of power in finding like some -- like a slight that kind of motivates you to try to live up to your potential. But he -- this idea that you need to constantly prove yourself in the eyes of others, I think you should prove yourself within yourself. And you’ll understand more when I get there because it's just really disgusting some of the stuff he does. And now, here's the problem, too. So now, he just had this issue when he's a young man, but he's living in Germany. And this -- there's still -- it's not like the level of antisemitism that happens, obviously, under Hitler, but they were second-class citizens even at this time. So it says, this gives you a good idea of what -- he's Jewish so what is that he has to deal with. He says, “For every German Jew, there's a painful moment that he remembers his entire life. The moment when he was first made fully conscious that he was born a second-class citizen, no ability and no achievement can free him from this”.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So that last sentence, Fritz didn't believe that. He thought, okay, I'm going to prove that I'm -- like he even converts to Christianity. He's not really into religion as it is. He just does it so like he can become more accepted because that's what most Germans were. And he is like, “No, I'm a German first, and we'll see that” -- yes, but not in the eyes of Hitler. So it says, “He endured his shares of taunts and teasing and emerged from school with an unexpected scar on his face”. You got to Google Fritz Haber, see what this guy looks like. At the same time, Haber’s interest in chemistry blossomed starting with semi-secret chemical experiments in this room. So he had a passion for chemistry from a very young age. When it came time to pick a profession, Haber proved a restless student, focusing mostly on chemistry, but also writing a bit of poetry, working for his father for a time, and serving in required 1-year stint in the military. He's still planning to be a chemist, but could not decide what kind of he wanted to be. It was as if he was too smart and too curious. He's had a level of indecisiveness. And then the note I left to myself on the next page is, progress is almost never linear, ups and downs and bursts. He never seemed satisfied and was always critical of himself. He earned money after graduation doing lab work in an alcohol distillery, a cellulose factory, and an ammonia soda factory, also worked at a molasses plant. This all bored him. He researched furiously, but without focus. That's what I mean it's not linear. He achieved little. The failure of this phase of Haber’s career, one of his closest friends later wrote, was total and protracted. So he’s struggling with his own personal insecurities. He is struggling with the fact that externally he's not achieving any kind of success. Eventually, he gets a job as a chemistry professor, but he decides that's just not enough. As you can kind of guess from somebody that works themselves to almost dying all the time. He does so throughout his life. This is a description of his personality. He wanted more. He always wanted more. He wanted more money, more fame, more respect. He worked too hard, took on too much, and still suffered from nerves. His career was everything to him, and he proved a distant and self-centered husband. His marriage suffered. So yes, he's a terrible husband, got divorced twice.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

His first wife actually kills herself. Some people think she does it because she was also a chemist, and she was distraught because eventually Fritz Haber among his other achievements, he's notorious and becomes almost -- no if -- he becomes a war criminal because he invents -- he's like credited with inventing chemical warfare, and he runs an experiment for the German -- in World War I for the German military that kills, I think, 60,000 troops, allied troops. So we'll get there in a minute. So this is the motivation for the search for the alternative, just to give you like a macro picture of what's going on, Germany dependent on the Chilean nitrates for its fertilizer and gunpowder, buying it by the ton and shipping it by the fleet halfway around the world. It was a dangerous addiction. It’s especially dangerous addiction because Germany keeps getting into these wars. Okay. So around this time, Fritz works for a few years. He finally comes up with a way to make this tiny, tiny machine that actually takes fixed nitrogen and turns it into ammonia. And then he goes off, and he wants -- it’s very popular at this time for scientists to make a discovery and then they partner with a company. In some cases, they sell their patents. So one of his main competitors that he -- that was also trying to do this at the time had previous success of selling one of his inventions for like 1 million marks, German marks at the time. So that's the kind of model that Fritz was trying to emulate. So he does a deal with this company called BASF. Interesting enough, BASF is still around today. It's actually still the largest chemical producer in the world.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

During the course of the story, it actually merges with like 4 or 5 other chemical companies and comes into this -- forms a new company called IG Farben, sometimes also called just Faber or Farben, maybe that's how you pronounce it. And that's Carl Bosch. He is working for BASF, becomes one of the founders of the new conglomerate. After World War II, they -- it's like basically, Hitler took over the firm, and so it's broken up. And now, BASF is spun back out, and it still exists today. It's actually 154 years old, which is kind of cool. All right. So first, here's Haber doing a deal with BASF. “On March 6, 1908, two contracts were signed between Haber and BASF. The company got what it wanted, ownership of any resulting patents and Haber’s agreement not to publish any of his findings without permission. Haber got 10% of any net earnings”. So this is something we've talked about a few times, always a bad idea. If you can avoid it to do a deal where you get net profits, if you can negotiate, always go for gross profits because companies -- you can -- they can make that net number look, however, they want to look as gross is what gross is. So he got 10% of any net earnings determined through an intricate set of calculations, of course. So of course, who is going to benefit from that? The people actually doing the calculations, come on. The BASF made from a process he developed. Now, this is the point in the story where we are introduced to Carl Bosch. Out of the 2 characters, I identify more and kind of would emulate more of like Bosch's, the way he goes about. Fritz has some defects in his personality. It causes him to make some really poor decisions. Carl, he had his stuff together. He was real tight. So here's the thing. He's working. They bring him over to look at Fritz Haber’s invention, right? And people are like, hey, this works now because you have to have like an insane amount of pressure. And like it's only going to work in this tiny -- let's say, the device is 2 feet tall.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I forgot how tall it is, but it's tiny. And they need to get it -- they eventually had to scale it up to something that's like 100 feet tall. And they're saying the pressure required like there's no metal or steel on earth, like it's going to explode or collapse, like this is useless, why are you doing this? So Carl actually -- his previous experience serves him well, and he realizes that the who people are saying that are actually incorrect. And so this becomes Carl Bosch's life mission, at least at this part in his career, to find a way to scale up Haber’s invention, right? And like the book said earlier, eventually, it turns into city-sized factories. The people that -- the person responsible for that is Carl Bosch. All right, so this is a little bit about Carl Bosch’s early life and career. And right now, he's in a room full of skeptics. They're examining Haber’s machine. He says, “Bosch knew something that rest of the men in the room did not. He knew about metals. Bosch had grown up around tools. His father was a successful gas and plumbing supplier, who had fitted their home with a complete workshop and given his boys (meaning his sons) free run. He had an open door into his father's business and visited the workmen often learning about pipe fitting, soldering, machining, and woodwork. As a young man, he did an internship at a metalworking firm. He took a summer job in a blast furnace plant and studied mechanical engineering for 2 years before switching to chemistry”. So these early -- he didn't know at the time. That’s why it's -- the common advice is you need to expose yourself especially when you're younger to all kinds of different experiences because you don't know how they're going to come into play later on in life. This winds up being extremely important to Bosch. “Bosch was hired as a chemist at BASF fresh out of university in 1899. From the start, he was a bit of an oddity. Chemists were kings at BASF, highly educated and highly-priced experts, responsible for discovering the new products that kept the firm afloat. Many of them came from the best universities in Germany. Most wore suits, ties, and stiff collars. They discussed art and music and literature in their off hours and maintained a clear dividing line between themselves and the firm's common laborers. Bosch did none of these things. He often took off his jacket once he got to work, loosened his tie, picked up a hammer or a wrench, and started banging away on some machine. He kept to himself mostly and seemed uncomfortable socializing”.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

That's why earlier I said -- I was quoting the author when he said that he prefers machines to people. “He seemed unafraid of blisters and stains. Early in his career, Bosch was found by a BASF executive in a plant workroom, his sleeves rolled up, face gleaming, stirring something in a vat. ‘My dear man”, the executive said, ‘if you think such foolishness will help you rise to the top of BASF you're sorely mistaken’. So this is Bosch's personality trait, why the manager of BASF trusted him. So he winds up being like the person running the company. He is like right-hand guy and what he thought of Fritz's experiment. So it says, “This is what they liked seeing in Bosch, the young man's willingness to take on a giant of chemistry”. So he was somebody before Haber had claimed to invent the same thing, and he was trying to sell to BASF. BASF hire -- or asked Bosch to investigate, like if it's actually true, winds up this guy already won like a Nobel Prize and everything. Bosch tried to replicate his experiments, he couldn't, and wrote honestly what his findings were. And the Nobel Prize winner was like, oh, this is your fault, that’s what you get for hiring this nobody to check. Other people check turns out that he was right. So that's what it means take on a giant of chemistry. “His ability to find answers and the backbone he showed”. His appreciation for the engineering side of the enterprise, his careful, quiet, considered opinions, Bosch was not apt to run -- to rush into anything. Bosch looked at Haber’s machine. Then he said to his bosses, “I think it can work. I know exactly what the steel industry can do. We should risk it”.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And now we are starting to see like little glimpses of the size of Bosch's ambition. And so it says, “There was no end to the nitrogen in the air. So in theory, there was no end to the amount of ammonia they could produce. Germany would no longer have to rely on shipping its raw material from fertilizer and gun power halfway around the world. Humans would be able to make as much fertilizers they needed forever from the air”. This process still continues today. “Global starvation would never again become a critical issue. It marked a turning point in human history. One historian later compared those hours in Haber’s lab to the Wright Brothers' flight at Kitty Hawk or Edison's discovery of a successful light bulb”. One of the attributes Carl Bosch had was he didn't rush into things, but once he committed to something he moved -- he optimized for speed. So things started to move quickly. “Carl Bosch was eager to move ahead. He wanted to start building a bigger prototype machine as quickly as he could. He and Haber worked together closely exchanging visits, writing letters, conferring about details of design and operation. Bosch wanted to know everything Haber knew. It was not long before Haber complaining of stomach pains and exhaustion retreated to a Swiss health resort. Bosch pushed the project forward”. So what's happening here is they're pushing the process forward before it's over. There would be dozens of patents covering every new aspect of the process. So this is another example. This is the beginning of another initiative that never existed. I feel like the last few weeks we've been covering this we talked about the beginning of electricity industry. We talked about the aviation industry last week. And now, we're into the fertilizer, the growth of basically the food and explosives industry. Okay. So the guy running BASF at the time is this guy named Brunck. And him and Bosch are kind of like minds. And here's some ideas they have about business. So it said, “They had similar administrative styles. They were both gambling on nitrogen. They both appreciated the importance of machinery along with chemistry. They both liked to hire talented people and give them a relatively free rein, and they both disliked yes-men. They both had the same idea about the chemical industry. They both understood that the game could be won only through ceaseless rapid-fire innovation with the next great idea going into development as soon as the previous one went on the market”.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So that applied -- back then, it applied earlier in human history, and it definitely still applies today. “They both understood the need for speed and for efficiency in order to make big ideas into reality. They both thought a decade or two down the road. They were both in short technological optimists”. This is why I say I identify more with Bosch than I do with Haber. Haber was kind of like make himself sick, a little bit pessimistic, although sometimes, I guess you could even argue that he was not pessimistic enough. But this whole idea of technological optimist. Specifically, this point right here, “Problems would be solved, solutions would be found”. In other words, like you may not know how to solve the problem now, but that's what you're doing. “You get paid because you solved the problem”. So just look at it like. hey, they're going to be solved, we're going to find the solutions. Haber had doubts about scaling up this idea as the way Bosch planned. That's what I mean about the pessimism. “Bosch pulled ahead, devoting himself to the sole goal of transforming Haber’s 2.5-foot-high laboratory machine into something the size of a factory”. That's a hell of a big problem, right? “He knew about the potential difficulties, but he also knew that if he started thinking too hard about all of them at once he would be overwhelmed”. So the note I left to myself is sometimes you have to turn your mind off. So he says, “If you think about it too hard, you would be overwhelmed”. So he stopped thinking and started working. That's a good advice for all of us. And I like this idea. He has this idea a few paragraphs later about the idea of a company as a machine. I really like the idea.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He says, “Bosch like machines he organized his people as if he were building one. From the start, he proved himself an able administrator and a master coordinator”. This is a reminder to all of us that nothing worthwhile comes easily. “Carl Bosch was dealing with a mountain of challenges, any one of which would become a disaster. The ammonia process was all tightly connected, one process flowing continuously into the next”. So he's describing the machine he has to build, “Which meant that a breakdown at any point could shut down the entire thing, everything, from the input gases to the heaters, to the reactors, to the recirculation system, to the coolers. Every connection, every valve, pump, gauge, seal, and fitting had to work flawlessly 24 hours a day 7 days a week at high temperatures and pressures. Almost none of the most important equipment existed. It all had to be invented. Systems like this had never been built and nothing could fail”. And we kind of see that this problem is so large that it kind of overtakes his entire life. He says, “He kept hiring engineers to help, doubling the number of BASF in the course of a few years. Bosch was obsessed with the project working day and night, running his teams hard, keeping the entire picture in his mind, seeing systems feeding into systems, fitting his gigantic machine together. Whenever anyone complained about the cost or the pace, when anyone balked at working long hours, he would say this is about billions, billions of marks, the future of the entire company rested on their efforts”. And as you could imagine, with the project, the size and scale of this, most of which -- almost all of which has never been done before, there's all kinds of problems where they're making progress, then they run into a problem they didn't think about, and the project literally stops until they can find the solution, which is what Bosch was just talking about.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this happens over and over and over again. I'm only going to use one example. Obviously, the rest are in the book, if you want to learn more, please read it. I can't recommend this book enough. I probably said it 5x already, but it's insane. It's just such a crazy story. But anyways, I want to talk to -- there's a specific thing that Bosch does that I think is applicable to all kinds of problems. And it reminds me that Charlie Munger quote, “Invert always invert.” So it says, so my note I left to myself is, “Bosch solves a huge problem by turning the problem upside down. Right now, the project is stopped”. It's, I think, months at this point, they can't figure this problem out. So it has to do with like there's all these explosions because hydrogen is getting into the steel and it weakens and it winds up exploding. So it says, “The next morning he realized that they've been going about it all wrong. They've been trying to change the steel to protect the steel. Why not simply accept the fact that hydrogen was going to attack it”? That was the problem. The hydrogen gets in there, weakens it over time and explodes. “There apparently was nothing they could do about it. High-pressure, high-temperature hydrogen was like some sort of universal solvent for metals. It eventually got into them all. Once he accepted that fact, Bosch realized something else. They've been asking two things of their oven walls, which is made out of steel. First, that they contain enormous pressures, and second, that they prevent the escape of gases, particularly the explosive hydrogen. What if he separated those two things? Why not let the hydrogen out? They have been” -- this is what I mean about turning the idea upside down. “They had been so focused on making the outer wall impenetrable, holding in the gases and the pressure”. But when they're doing that, eventually, they reach a point where the pressure is too much and it explodes, right? He goes, “But what mattered was not whether hydrogen leaked out, but how much. If only a little leaked and leaked slowly into a large area, the concentration would not build up enough to pose a danger”, meaning it would not explode.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So they wind up doing these like -- first day, they have -- they're doing two things. They're letting the hydrogen out. They drill like these little holes and then you also find different levels of steel. So it says, “Bosch's team started building and testing full-size ovens, and they stayed intact after weeks and then months. The project was back on track. And before, I think, they were exploding and failing within like 2 or 3 or 5 days, something like that. So it was a big, big problem. Okay. So let's skip ahead a little bit here. Oh, I like this idea. So he gets -- the first factor he makes, he creates this place called Oppau, O-P-P-A-U. I don't know how to pronounce it, but I like the idea of viewing your accomplishments as a step along the way to better things. So it says, “Within a year, the factory (I'm just going to call it the factory) was making tons of ammonia-based fertilizer every hour. BASF was selling it as fast as they could make it. Once they got into a full swing, the profits were enormous. Bosch had done everything he could to maximize efficiency and to cut the cost of production. Instead of seeing the factory as a final stop” -- this is what I mean about. So another note I left myself, I guess I should read that to you first, was-- obviously, you need -- the idea of viewing your accomplishments is just one step along the way of being better -- like constantly improving and getting to better things, right? And the second note was what happens here is when you're reading these biographies and you’re listening -- I guess, in your case, listening to them, reading biographies, listening to them, it really stretches what you believe is possible. We have this tendency as humans to kind of just narrow, like constantly like when you're a kid, the world is full of magic, everything is amazing. There's like possibilities and dreams are limitless. And it's very natural over time like our dreams get smaller, our possibilities get smaller. We're like narrowing life for no good reason other than it's just part of our nature.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I think you need tools in your life or experiences in your life to realize that the world is wide open, and you can do and achieve whatever the hell you want to. And so I'm about to read -- like Carl Bosch had this mindset -- his mindset -- I'm not saying it's impossible, it's rare, but we're seeing this over and over and over again in these books. And I think it's extremely important. It’s just like -- it's like a slap in the face. Hopefully, when you press play every week you're listening to this, this like smacks you in the like, no, you can do what you want to do. There are no limits. We have not reached the maximum of human potential. And so on a microcosm of that is the maximum of your potential in your own life. So you have this -- he worked for years to get this up. Remember, I think it's like September 1913 is where we're at. Six, seven years or something like that of failures, starting again, failing, starting again, failing starting again. Now, they finally get to the point where they're making -- they're the only company in the world that has this process. It's unbelievably valuable. They're printing money. And Bosch is like, “Okay, cool, let's see what else we can do. Like why am I going to rest on my laurels, I'm still alive”. So he says, “Instead of seeing Oppau, the factory, as a final stop in the development process, Bosch seemed to view it as another bigger prototype, a step on the way to even bigger things. The speed at which Bosch made things happen was surprising. It was terra incognita for Bosch and his teams and problems had to be solved in new ways with new equipment and new ideas. They invented as they went. It was the birth of an entirely new technology, high-pressure chemistry. Bosch began thinking if this high-pressure technology could make ammonia, what else could it make”.

Now, I'm just going to take a weird tangent here because I love -- when I first started Founders podcast, I didn’t -- it wasn't called Founders. I didn't know what I was doing. I was just reading biographies. And one of the biographies I read was Einstein. And I did a podcast on it. I don't think it's that good. It's not around anymore, but he's just a really funny character. And I just want to compare and contrast because Germany at this time is like --basically this is the -- the amount of talent they had. And like this just shows you how stupid Hitler was. He had like the -- probably the largest collection of the most talented people in the world, and his racism and just -- and we're going to -- I'll tell you a little bit more about Hitler in the book, too. He is a doofus. He is a doofus. He's got all kinds of people, and he just runs them out because they're Jewish. He's just so stupid. But anyways, a lot of these people know each other. And so Haber winds up making an acquaintance with Einstein. And I just want to -- this paragraph just makes me chuckle. And I just want to compare and contrast Haber and Einstein here. So it says, “Einstein came to know Fritz Haber. Haber pushed for bringing Einstein back to Germany because at the time Einstein was in Switzerland”. And so he greatly respected Einstein's mind. So it says, “But the 2 men could hardly have been more different. Haber was completing his transformation into the perfect German”. Remember, I told you these weird psychological issues of like wanting outside like validation. Maybe -- I'm not going to psychoanalyze, but who knows. Perfect German. “He was pro-military, pro-Kaiser”. Kaiser Wilhelm is the leader of Germany around World War I. He's the one that gets Germany into the disaster, this World War I. So he says, “He was pro-military, pro-Kaiser, even more than stiff-necked, Prussian-style patriot -- or ever the more stiff-necked, Prussian-style patriot”.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“Einstein was a free-thinking, wise-cracking cosmopolitan, a bohemian pacifist who enjoyed making fun of precisely the traits Haber was coming to embody”. I would much rather identify with Einstein. It’s just like I don't think you should -- a lot of the problems with interpersonal human relations is the fact that we're tribalistic. And I think if you just understand that's part of our nature, you try to -- you bring it to the forefront of your mind, you kind of avoid like joining groups. I mean that's part of the reason I call the membership program as the misfits because like -- I think we're studying and we're attracting like a group of people that don't want to be in a group. Like I want -- most of the people that I hear from they're independent-minded, they want to do their own thing, like they don't need -- they don't have this desire, this endless desire to conform like you see Haber has here. So I give you a good point of where we're at in the story. A few days later, Germany declared war on Russia, yes, that’s real smart. Einstein during that long night after his wife left talked with Haber about the military mindset of Germany and the madness of war. Haber, on the other hand, had already volunteered for service. So he says, “You know what I'm going to prove I’m a good German, I'm going to serve them in all the capacity.” That's when he starts developing chemical warfare. So I don't want to be like Haber, I’d much rather be like Einstein. Okay. So now, we're going to get into this -- they're feeding people. But now we see that this process also is why it fuels the rise of Hitler. And in World War I -- before the process, the World War I jumps out, but the process isn't like perfected at the time, right? They're producing some but not nearly the quantities they are going to do about 10 or 20 years from now. So part of the allied forces realized, “Oh, Germany, like you need all this -- you have to import the nitrates that you're using for explosives from Chile. Well, guess what, we're going to send our boats over there, and so they started disrupting the Germany's flow of explosives”.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Bosch is basically -- later in his career, he has to figure how to make synthetic gasoline to power Hitler’s like tanks and planes and everything, but also because Hitler wanted to emulate -- he wanted Germans to be driving cars like Americans drove. So this is more of the thinking here. This is what's going to cause him to found this giant company, and he's the one who's going to run it. He says, “In the post-war world, after World War I, before World War II, corporators just needed to join together if they were going to build vast new plants using expensive new technology. In Britain, four firms banded together after the war to form the Imperial Chemical Industries. In the United States, five firms joined to make Allied Chemical. If the Germans were to compete, they would have to do the same. When the German government began to pass laws in the early 1920s that benefited the formation of larger business entities, it became clear that the time was right to merge”. So it’s called -- I'm not even going to try to pronounce a German thing of it, but it's called IG Farben or simply Farben. Farben was at the moment of its birth the largest business in Europe, the largest chemical company in the world, and the third-largest business organization of any sort. So what's interesting to me is, these trends, I think, are reversing in the age that we live in. It's my sincere belief that the optimal size of a company is shrinking. And there's actually -- if you listen to the podcast I did for the reviewers-only feed on this book, it's called Unscaled. So it's essentially a book laying out saying, hey, for the last 200 years, everything was centralized and growing big and you had a benefit to being large. And now that process is reversing. I think that's obvious, but some people still -- I don't know if it's -- some people still find that controversial, which I don't see how it is. You can look at the numbers and kind of extrapolate where that's going to end up to.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And this is very common in World War II. Once Hitler effectively takes over IG Farben, the allies do the same thing, except they don't have to disrupt shipments from South America on sea, they just bombed the c_*_ out of this gigantic factory that Bosch makes. We're still -- this is -- we're still 20 years earlier from this happening. But this whole idea of taking like -- basically trying to kneecap your enemies and trying to limit their ability to create weapons is very common. So the notes I left to myself was, “The side with access to fixed nitrogen would win the war. Germany miscalculated how long World War I would last. They thought it was going to take a few months (so dumb) and was running out of gunpowder and explosives and then a variation of the Haber-Bosch process would be the solution”. So this is when BASF starts working with the government. It says, “When the deal was signed, BASF was no longer just a chemical firm. It was a defense industry. Bosch did not much like it. His team recognized the irony. They work long and hard to feed people. Now, the same technology was going to be used to kill them. Bosch did not talk about it much, but he felt it”. This is actually -- he dies very unhappy, unfortunately. He felt a lot of guilt, especially with the rise of Hitler. The need for nitrate led to bizarre events like this. “This led to one of the stranger moments of World War I, when on November 1, 1914, the first” -- this is what I was just referencing earlier, kind of stepping over my own point here. “The first major sea battle of the war began halfway around the world from Germany and France off the coast of Chile”. Oh, man. A reminder -- this is a note that I left to myself, a reminder, that traits that make you strong can make you weak. Bosch is genius in making his factory one great integrated machine was good for efficiency, but bad during wartime.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“Oppau, the factory, was so closely knit that one well-placed bomb could shut down the whole thing”. And that's -- I don't want you to mistake my point I am making here. I'm not saying it's Bosch’s fault. He didn't think about utilizing this for war. His intentions at that time when he built a centralized factory was to make it most efficient process to actually feed the people. And unfortunately, Bosch dedicated his life to this, and it was hijacked by a crazy a in Hitler, and this guy winds up drinking, becoming an alcoholic later in his life, and you have a supremely smart and talented person, and his life was ruined by this just one of the worst human beings ever lived. So -- and at least Bosch sees it. The reason -- like Fritz is a smart person, has got interesting ideas, but God, this is not one of them. And what I'm about to read to you. And I wrote the note when I came across this section, bad idea, you should question everything. And Fritz doesn't do that. I don't understand -- I shouldn't say I don't understand because we've seen this over and over again, but like you could be so smart, and he was one of the few people who won I think 2 Nobel prizes. One of the most intellectual scientist and chemist in human history. And this is his side of his personality, where he doesn't -- it's like isn't science like questioning like what is actually true. Like why wouldn't you apply it to different domains in your life? So it says, this description of Fritz in World War I, “He became more Prussian by the day, organized, tireless, efficient, head shaved, mustache neatly trimmed, clothes immaculate, monocle at the ready. During this period of his life, Haber's existence revolved around, as one of his sons later wrote, an uncritical acceptance of the state's wisdom”. You can't like -- I don't think it's smart for any of us to accept -- like to just blindly accept anything anybody is telling us. Like we should question everything. Everybody makes mistakes. We're all imperfect human beings. This idea that there's some kind of deity like this godlike character to human beings is just not true. And that applies for individuals, and it applies to companies, it applies to states. Like you can -- uncritical acceptance, no way. No way.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

What is this? Carl Bosch managed the whole thing. He hated war and rationalized his work by saying, “In wartime, it’ll keep Germans safe. In peacetime, it will keep Germans from starving”. So let's see what I meant by that. By 1918, running at full capacity -- so this is the giant. So he built the Oppau plant. It is smaller and is closer to France. At the end of World War I, France comes in and kind of like occupies it because it's so close to them. So they start building -- they decided they need to build a bigger factory close like in this more like center of Germany. And it's called Leuna. Well, that's not how you pronounce it, but that’s how I am pronouncing it. And it's giant. So it says, “By 1918 running at full capacity, Leuna had become Germany's industrial marvel. It was bigger than any Ford plant. They used technology that no one else could duplicate. It helped Germany in the war. Some historians have estimated that World War I would have ended a year, perhaps 2 years sooner if Haber-Bosch had not been able to make nitrates needed for explosives”. So this is the actual factory that I mentioned earlier that keeps Hitler alive in World War II. Eventually, the allies started bombing it, but some historians said if they just bombed it -- said if they took -- if they would have wiped it out earlier in the war, like at the very beginning, if they just -- if their entire -- I'm tripping over my words here, come on, I can speak. Let's go. “If the allies had made Leuna the sole focus, they said that Hitler would have been wiped out in eight weeks. Okay. It took a lot of words to get to that point. I'm sorry. This may be one of the strangest, most complicated problems a business had ever faced.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. So this is what I mean, France is going to come over here and take all their assets. This is a crucial moment for BASF. When the war ended, the victors occupied what had been German land, including the area around their ammonia factory. Bosch knew that it would be difficult for competitors to replicate his success with fixed nitrogen on the basis of seized patents alone. So we're just saying -- essentially, they're saying, you're using these patents for a war, so we're going to take it. We're not going to respect it. And not only that, we're going to take over the factory, and we’re going to try to reverse engineer. So that's what I mean this is the strangest, most complicated problems a business ever-faced. Bosch is leading this at the time. So it says, “It would be difficult if they seize the factories, review their operation, and dissected an oven or two. If that happened, there was a very good chance that the ammonia secret would be out and BASF would lose all its competitive advantage. Even in the midst of political chaos business was business”. So it is saying like, “If the factory is not running, there's no way you're going to reverse engineer it. But if the factory is running, you might be able to”. So I needed to clarify my previous statement. “The important thing for Bosch was that two of his company’s three main factories would be under French control for who knew how long because there's an interim time between” -- I think, it’s -- I think they -- yes, the Treaty of Versailles, which kind of settles World War I. There's like several months, but they didn't know the timeframe to that, between when hostilities ended World War I and the official ending, right? So he's got to navigate himself and try not -- because if -- BASF is the only company in the world that knows how to do this. And of course, now, every country has plants that do the Haber-Bosch process. But at the time, he's trying to protect his competitive advantage because he's not -- like he's not involved in war. He's just a businessperson. So he does stuff. I mean, this is kind of like he's got interesting ideas. Like he essentially does like guerilla warfare, not obviously with weapons. But he says, “Whenever a French inspector appeared, the BASF employees laid down their tools. Any machine in operation was switched off”.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

”The inspectors would arrive at a building to find needed ladders mysteriously missing, and in at least one case, an entire flight of stairs. Important gauges sometimes disappeared or had their faces blacked out. Without seeing the ammonia ovens in operation, the French could not figure out the Haber- Bosch system. Bosch and his people knew that the -- that technology was too complex, too precise, and too interconnected for easy comprehension. Bosch was playing a difficult game. In the long term, he needed to deny his ammonia-making secret to the allies. In the short term, however, he needed to make money for BASF and to keep his workers busy”. And now, here's the thing, all -- this is all temporary. Bosch is not a stupid man by any means. He knows -- like especially -- so he's one of the people that goes to Versailles, and he just realizes, oh, like this is not even a negotiation, like they are -- they clearly won the war and they're going to take -- they're going to do whatever they want to do because they won. And so he realizes, listen, he's got to solve one of the most complicated problems. And they're -- all the people from Germany are in this hotel, but it's really like a prison. There's like guards outside and everything else. So he's realizing like, “I need to -- my people need to work and the factories need to be running for the citizens of Germany, so we can feed them”. So he realizes, “I'm going to have to give up the most valuable thing I have, and that's the Haber-Bosch process”. So this is the story of how he solves the problem, and he does this on his own. This is why they said he's like one of the most complicated figures of the 20th century. “Under the cover of darkness late one night Bosch climbed over the wall and wire surrounding the hotel, avoided the guards, and made his way through the streets of Versailles to a secret meeting. He spoke there with a highly placed representative of the French chemical industry, businessman to businessman”. So there's a very -- just like in most times in war, there's a -- it's really hard to tell where business ends and the state begins. And so he realizes like these people have a huge sway with what the government needs because they realize they want the process. They want it for not only to feed their people, but they want it for the explosives.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“It was straightforward. Bosch only had one thing to offer, and he offered it to the French, the chance to build a Haber-Bosch plant. In exchange, he wanted a promise that the two factories he built so far would stay open”. That's Oppau and Leuna. I don't know what happens to the third one. “The French would get what they wanted, an operating Haber-Bosch plant, and Bosch would keep his nitrogen plants running. Bosch was rewarded for his negotiating skills by being made head of the company, something he both wanted and dreaded”. Remember, he doesn't even like people. He lived -- meaning dealing with people. “He lived and breathed BASF, thought himself skilled enough to run it, but hated the prospect of endless meetings. He would rather spend his time tinkering with machines and figuring out personnel issues, but his sense of mission was engaged now”. That's kind of devastating. You have to give it away. And within -- and they do like this “deal,” and they're going to be -- they are like, okay, we're going to -- don't worry, you tell us this process, we'll pay you like a royalty. They're not doing that. I think they wind up paying him a little bit, but they just wind up stealing it. I mean, that is what's the old saying, like to the victors goes spoils. So that was definitely the case here. So I just want to -- this is the chaos. I just can't imagine like how difficult and how much pressure Carl Bosch was under because this is the chaos of running a company in post-World War I Germany. So it says, “Carl Bosch understood machines. He had an affinity for things made of metal, but he was less talented when it came to understanding people. This became an issue for him in his new role as the head of the world's biggest chemical firm. He found” -- remember, he hasn't founded IG yet. “He found himself in the early 1920s running a company blessed with the world's most profitable new technology and cursed with some of the world's most challenging labor and financial problems. His first years of directorship were marked by crisis after crisis”.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I'm not going to read these different parts. I just made a list for myself, and I'm going to read the list I made to you. He has to deal with labor disputes, the rise of communism, inflation. So this is around the time of the Weimar Republic. “Armed factory takeovers by both the French and workers, explosion that killed hundreds of workers and reinvasion by France”. They keep going in there. This is the emotional strain. Companies are not families, and you have to treat humans -- you cannot treat humans like machines. So this is just -- this is when -- well, let me just read it. “Bosch felt both betrayed and perplexed. He wanted to be a good father to his first company as Brunck (that's the guy that used to run the company but was now dead and kind of the one that mentored him) had been”. I think that's a mistake. Like we have to -- this whole ethos in business that, oh, yes, we're one big family. No, families are -- if you really think about how family is operated, they're socialistic, companies are capitalistic. They're not run the same. Like if you work for a company that says you’re family, like that's not true. You can tell how they treat you. Like you don't kick somebody out of the family. You easily be fired from a company. Like I don't like that terminology, I guess is my point. “He felt himself to be a liberal giving man, willing to listen to reason. He did not seem to realize that it was his own personality, uncomfortable around people, chronically devoted to efficiency, somewhat mechanical and often distant, coming across as brusque that often got in the way of developing good labor relations”. So he had this thing, which is like -- have you read these reports of how it is to work in like an Amazon warehouse like the people actually collect the stuff we order and ship it. It's like they're monitored by the minute. They're like pushed to take faster bathroom breaks, all this kind of like weird stuff. Bosch employed a lot of this in the name of efficiency.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The problem is like the humans aren’t machines. So if you're going to act like that, then find a way to automate it or do a robot. But if you're hiring humans, you should have at least a basic dignity to treat them as humans. This is an interesting quote. I reference having to do with inflation. Once that rampant inflation happened, it said, “A pound of bread could cost 800 million marks, a pound of butter would cost a billion”. Bosch winds up going. So he realizes that he's going to need to -- this is when BASF, and I don't know, 4 or 5 other companies are going to merge into one giant chemical company. And that's the one that he runs that -- but the problem was just like when he centralized the initial factory and then once they take it over, like what was once an asset to the company becomes a liability, same thing happens here, but he goes -- what's interesting is like most of the people that we cover on the podcast, he learned -- he studied other founders. And this is where he comes up with this idea of a super company. So he goes over to America actually. And he realizes -- it says, “the German chemists saw the United States as their only real competition for industrial dominance. Bosch was thinking about fusing German dye and chemical firms into a single big organization and wanted to see firsthand how giant U.S. businesses like Standard Oil operated. He came home with new insights about the future. Everywhere he looked in American cities, he saw streets jammed with automobiles. Everybody wanted one. The United States was a car -- it was car crazy in part because Henry Ford had figured out a way to mass produce them cheaply enough to bring them within reach of millions of buyers”. So he's going to do the same thing, not for automobiles, but for this process of creating ammonia. And interesting enough, Hitler winds up becoming crazy.

I definitely think that the numbers become -- I think -- my own personal belief, and I don't really have any proof of this, I just thought that I think companies are going to become tiny, and yet they're going to be able to serve tons and tons and tons of customers still. So there'll be a large impact, probably large in profit, not large in headcount. But anyways, if you haven't heard that, and if you don't have access to it, just get in touch with me and I’ll send you the feed. And you can read the book Unscaled. I haven't read it. It's been a few months or I forgot when I read it, but I do recall that you don't have to read the middle of the book. I think at the time, I said, if you just read the first two chapters and the last two chapters, you kind of get the author’s point. That's how it is with most business books. That's why I read biographies instead because there's no point skipping a biography, but there's a lot of point in skipping business books. I think most of them should be way shorter. This is stretching what you think is possible. So let me just read this, “Standard Oil was a big company, but even its technical director was stunned by a visit in the spring of 1926 to the company's plants’. So now, this is Farben. Remember, a few years prior, Bosch goes to the United States to learn from Standard oil. Now, he applied those lessons, and Standard Oil is coming over here to -- or coming over here, coming over to Germany to study them. And they realize, oh my god, this -- they're doing way -- they're on a scale we didn't even realize. So they were stunned by a visit in the spring of 1926 to the company's plants. The person that did -- the representative of Standard Oil said he was, “Plunged into a world of research and development on a gigantic scale, such I had never seen”. He called Bosch's synthetic fuels project tremendously significant. Remember, if the new firm is going to succeed -- it's going to survive, its monopoly on the Haber-Bosch process is over. He had to give it away after World War I. Now, all chemical companies in the world are using it, some -- to differing levels of success, whatever the case is. So he's got to come up with a new thing.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Synthetic fuels is like an even harder problem, and they wind up running because at the time, -- let me back up. I didn't explain this clearly enough. Around this time, the world was convinced that we hit peak oil, that they were going to -- everything is going to run dry. Oh my -- it's like the same thing that they thought was going to happen, if they don't find new fertilizers, the world is going to starve. It turns -- so they start doing synthetic fuel. The problem is while all these chemical companies, especially Bosch's companies, dumping tons of money in research and development and trying to find synthetic fuel, they wind up being successful, but then in the United States, you have the start of the oil boom. And they -- I think it was in Oklahoma. They accidentally discover what turns out to be like an ocean of oil. And so that -- what's going to happen, that drops the price to where natural oil -- crude oil is way cheaper. So -- we're not there in the story yet, but that -- I don't even know if I talk about it, but that throws off this whole idea. But it winds up being important because Hitler is like, well, “The United States when I am at war with them is not going to let me import oil”. So he had -- that's why he took over IG Farben. So it says, “Calling Bosch's synthetic fuel project tremendously significant. He too had to admit how far ahead of the United States the Germans were. “I had not known what research meant until I saw it, and he said, “We were babies compared to what they were doing”. So that's just another example of exposing yourself to the full scope and capabilities of the human species, the very best of the best at whatever they're doing, just going to push you to do -- to realize, hey, I can do a lot more than I think I can. Okay. So now, I'm skipping ahead. And now, we have to deal with the jackass that is Hitler. And he's purging. We haven't been talking about Fritz. Fritz at this time, he sold all his stuff to Bosch, essentially, Bosch’s company. And he just wants to -- he's the head of an institute. He's doing research. They tried to try him for war crimes. I don't think he was convicted, but – no, he definitely wasn't convicted or maybe he was like convicted, but he could never travel to France. I don't remember the exact details, unfortunately, sorry.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But he's running this Institute in Germany. And Hitler is like, “Well, I want the Jews out of here”. And at the beginning, it was like -- it was step-by-step. And so -- hey -- it was like, hey, like Hitler’s Jewish conspiracy is that they are controlling money, they are controlling science. So get all these people out of these institutes, like purge them, replace them with Aryans. And at first, Haber got an exception because he was a German war hero. Now, in Britain, he was hated because he killed -- I think it was 60,000 -- the number was 60,000 -- 60,000 plus, but I'm pretty sure it was the British soldiers that died from that chemical attack, and they knew it came from Haber. But in Germany, he was like a war hero because that helped them because they were at war with Britain at the time. So now, he's giving a direct order, get rid of these Jewish people, and it says, “But how could he stay on when many of the people who worked at the institute would be forced out simply for being Jewish? How could he bring himself to sign the dismissal papers? While he thought about options, he made other decisions. Albert Einstein traveling in the United States attacked the Nazis in print and never returned to Berlin”. So he knew from the get-go. He was telling Haber, “Get the hell out of there. And Haber was like, ‘No, I'm a German’”, like his whole life was there. He dedicated his whole life to being accepted as the -- like the prototypical subservient German and didn't realize that Hitler is not -- even though you had antisemitism under the Kaiser before, like Hitler is different level, and we're going to see this because he meets with Bosch, too. The guy is so dumb.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“Haber was torn. Part of him hoped that the madness would blow over, that the German people would not stand for it, that Hitler's government would see sense. Didn't the Nazis realize that forcing out Jews’ research would gut Germany’s scientific programs”? That's what I mean by how dumb this guy was, not Haber, Hitler obviously. “Jews scientists were simply too successful, too integral in Germany's international eminence. How could they be told to leave without doing irreparable damage? How could the Nazis throw away a century of achievement? It was beyond belief, it was madness”. Yes, well, look what you're dealing with. This is Einstein's perspective and Haber’s regret. So he was -- did he already leave. Eventually, he leaves. He has to leave. The problem Hitler explained was that, “Jews are all communists, so Jew is a Jew. They all cling together”. So -- because Planck, Max Planck goes and meets with -- he is a friend of Haber, and he meets with Hitler. He is like, do you understand like what -- he called it German scientific self-mutilation, what Hitler was doing. And Hitler’s response was, well, Jew is a Jew. Stupid. So Planck tried to return to his point about science to chancellor, that’s Hitler, began talking faster and louder, pounding his hand on his knee, flying into a rage, so fierce that the elderly Planck had to leave the room. So he's telling his friend. He is like, “You better get the hell out of here. This is not good for you”. So Haber was shattered. It was not just his health this time, not just nervous exhaustion, but a feeling that he created the life for himself that was false, that he had been living a lie. He had spent his career fashioning himself into the perfect German. He now understood what that meant in Hitler’s terms. Despite his conversion to Christianity, his Nobel Prize, his iron cross, his efforts to save the nation, his international stature, his service, his achievements, and his value as a man, the only thing that mattered was that he was a Jew. Einstein writing to his old friend Haber from the United States put Haber’s dilemma into scientific terms.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This is a quote from Einstein now. “I can imagine your inner conflicts. It is somewhat like having to abandon a theory on which you have worked your whole life. It is not the same for me because I never believed it in the least”, meaning I never believed that the German people would ever put aside the fact that Einstein was Jewish. He's like, “You believe in a fairytale”. Haber’s response was more emotional, “I am bitter as never before. And the feeling that this is unbearable increases by the day. I was German to an extent that I fully feel only now, and I'm filled with incredible disgust”. That's unbelievably sad getting to the end of your life. He is going to die in a few years from now where we are in the story. And I don't know, I think I always think about like the importance of understanding like what is real, what -- how are things really -- like not how people tell us how they are because people told Haber, he understood, oh, if you're just a good service, you convert to Christianity, German first. That was not true. And he dies -- rest of his life he's like running from country to country, and he winds up dying of a heart attack. He doesn't have a place to live. Eventually, Israel says that they'll take him in. But like he tries to go to Britain, and Britain is like, dude, do you think we forgot what you did to us? Like I don't know, man, it's just -- it's devastating. And so now, Bosch is going to go through some of this, too. And Bosch, he winds -- he doesn't die poor like Haber does. Haber stopped getting his royalty and instead decides -- he is like placed with the institutes of social security, he can live off the salary, so he gets a lumpsum. That obviously proves not a good idea. So Bosch is running the largest firm, and he has such, he has to meet Hitler because Hitler is going to tell him what he wants. Bosch made the mistake of meeting with Hitler privately. This is going to happen within a few weeks after Haber resigned.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Bosch’s meeting with Hitler started well enough. Bosch talked about synthetic gasoline and the need to expand Leuna. Hitler seemed agreeable. Then Bosch felt compelled to start talking about the civil service law. That's a law that expelled the Jewish people from like any kind of important job and the damage that would be done to German chemistry and physics if it was applied unsparingly to Jewish scientists. So Bosch, again, is trying to reason with this person. He's like, “No, like we need -- you're about to go to war, you're going to need -- I can't run the company, and Germany can't succeed without the talent we have”. Hitler lost his temper. He shouted, “You don't understand these matters” and started ranting about the Jewish threat. Doofus, that's the word I think of when I think of Hitler. If Jews were so important to physics -- then this is what I mean, this is how stupid -- okay, I'm not going to get upset. “If Jews were so important to physics and chemistry, Hitler said, then we'll just have to work 100 years without physics and chemistry. How are you going to win” -- the World War II was a war of technology, “How are you going to win that without reverting back 100 years in physics and chemistry”? This is what I mean when you get obsessed with ideology and you stop being a rational person like very common for humans to do but very dumb for us to do. When Bosch tried to disagree Hitler, in a calculated insult rank for an aide and announced that his visitor wished to leave. So he's not listening to reason. He's listening to -- he's ideological. Oh, man. I just feel so bad for Bosch and Haber. This is Haber on regret. This is -- he’s about to suffer -- he's giving a speech. He's in Switzerland. And right after the speech he suffers a heart attack. He lives for like a few, maybe like a few more months, but he's going to die very soon. And think about it like this -- so I want to bring this up because this is on the forefront of his mind. This is the remarks he chooses to focus on.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Like when you're giving a speech and you know people are going to hear it and then it's going to be reported on, like he’s probably going to talk about something that's important to you. And it's just -- it's devastating to me that like you get to the end of your life, and all the work in progress is done and you’re filled with regret. And this is what he says. He says, “I was one of the mightiest men in Germany. I was more than a great army commander, more than a captain of industry. I was the founder of industries. My work was essential for the economic and military expansion of Germany. All doors were open for me. That now meant nothing. At the end of my life, I find myself bankrupt”. And I'll close on this part. But before I read it, I just -- I can't imagine, and I think the author Thomas Hager has -- does such a great job painting the story for us. Just the idea that you could have such accomplishments that were so important to your species as a whole and for it to be overtaken. Unfortunately, they both die. I think they both die before Hitler is dethroned. And just I couldn't imagine what they -- what that felt like. The fact that all your effort, all your time, everything, and it was taken -- such a beautiful invention that could help humans. Humans alive now, that's responsible for the population growth that we've seen, literally, billions and billions of humans in the future are better off because of the work that Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch did, and yet you can -- you see the downside of our species as well with what like Hitler does. So I just want to read this. And he's going to touch on that a little bit here. “Back in 1932, just before Hitler first took power, Bosch had said about the Haber-Bosch ammonia process. I have often asked myself whether it would have been better if he had not succeeded. The war, meaning World War I, perhaps would have ended sooner with less misery and on better terms. Gentlemen, these questions are all useless. Progress in science and technology cannot be stopped. They are, in many ways, akin to art. One can persuade the one to halt as little as the others. They drive the people who are born for them to activity”. He had been driven to activity and the consequences were now clear. Bosch's life work, his breakthroughs and factories, his attempts to feed the world and make profits for his company were being used to arm and fuel the Nazi machine. That's what it had come to. Bosch was no longer relevant. The Nazi state had gotten what it wanted from him, and his opinion no longer mattered. After the invasion, this invasion of Poland, Bosch fell completely from public view. He winds up becoming alcoholic and dies shortly thereafter. He was -- probably an alcoholic, lasts like 10 years of his life or so. He struggled a lot internally with what was being -- like what his inventions were being used for. So I'll leave the story there. Do you want to read more? I’ll leave the link in the show notes. If you buy the book using that link, Amazon sends me a small percentage of sale at no additional cost to you. I can't recommend it enough. It was a fantastic story. I just -- I cannot believe the skill, which with the author had and just packed so much information in a relatively 300 pages or maybe even less than that. All right. One other favor for you -- first of all, thank you very much for supporting the podcast. Without your support, I could not do this work. So I'm -- I owe you everything. Really do appreciate it. One request, if I can. If you can just help me spread the word, tell friends about the podcast, send them links, encourage them to subscribe and to listen, I greatly appreciate it.

And I will be back next week. Let's see I have -- let me just tell you what I have coming up. I have a book that was recommended by Marc Andreessen. It's on the founder of IBM. That's what I'll be doing next week. And it looks like finally, I've been working my way through 50 years of Warren Buffett’s. I don't know if you can hear that. That's me opening and closing all the pages in this gigantic book that's in front of me, and it's 50 years of Warren Buffett’s shareholder letters. I'm going to only -- that will obviously be only for misfits, for you guys. It has taken me a while because it's like 700 and some pages, and it's not like a normal-sized book. It's like a size of a textbook, but I think it's going to be really interesting. I do think it will probably be done 2 weeks from now. So look forward to that. So next week, Thomas Watson, Founder of IBM, one of the most successful companies of all time. And then the week after that, Warren Buffett. So thank you very much for listening. Thank you for telling your friends. I love you very much, and I'll talk to you later.

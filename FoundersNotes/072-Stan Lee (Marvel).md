He felt this way in the, let's say, this 1950s we are in now. There's people in present day that feel their way and in 150 years from now, there will still be people that feel the same way. It's really like sometimes when I feel anxiety or I'm unsure, like I pause and I'm like David, this is not just happening to you. This feeling you're having is part of the human condition. It's been happening in the past; it will happen in the future. So don't let it freak you out, calm down, write out your feelings if you need to write down like what's bothering you? And then I love that Henry Kaiser quote, "Like problems are just opportunities in work clothes." Like but feeling miserable about it is not helping anything. I understand it's like natural. It's a natural like part of being human. But I feel like that -- looking at things like stepping outside myself and looking back and like, okay, oh, I'm anxious. Okay. Well, most humans are anxious, and they always will be, most likely. So what are we going to do about it? I mean this guy is calling himself. I was only a moderately successful hack. So why I mean if he feels that way, why wouldn't we, right? Waiting for some elusive big break and the chance to get out of comics and into the real world. This is such an important sentence coming up. What I didn't understand at that point in my life was that comics were the real world to me. And he's not going to understand that for quite some time. We're still early in the book. Okay. We are like in the middle of the book. Okay. And that's funny. I didn't even -- a few pages later. I'm looking at the note that I left myself, you ever feel like you're wasting your life Stan lee felt that way, too. And so we're going to see more of that here. As time went by, one problem that kept nodding at me had nothing to do with the comic book characters or plots, but rather with the plot of my own life. I was still feeling more and more frustrated and discouraged. I realized that was almost 40 years old and still doing comic books.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I studied hard and skipped grades, which put me in with older kids. But as you might imagine, it's no fun being the youngest kid in class. So then he talks about -- it's amazing. He's close to 80 years old writing these words, and he could still remember his favorite teacher, which is this guy named Leon Ginsburg. And he talked about like something that he learned from Leon that he applied to -- for the rest of his life. He said, he would entertain the class with humorous and exciting stories to illustrate teaching points. It was Mr. Ginzburg, who first maybe realized that learning could be fun, that it was easier to reach people, to hold their attention, to get points across, with humor than any other way. It was a lesson I never forgot and a lesson I've tried to apply to everything I do. So he's definitely like this book is pretty funny, like he's very -- and he comes out extremely likable, even though he is extremely confident, most people would consider him an arrogant person. And again, I don't really have a problem with that. I'd rather be who you are and if you're really deep down like an arrogant person, like a lot of people let other people's personality kind of like distract them. So think about like how much we've learned collectively about Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos and James Dyson, any of the people we cover, do you think any of them are not arrogant like they may hide their arrogance in the case of Steve Jobs, he definitely denied it. But I just -- I think you should learn from people that even people you disagree with, nothing you have to go and act like you shouldn't be an ass or mean to people for no reason. But I just think that you have to be who you are, and I prefer real arrogance over false modesty and Stan -- I mean, you're going to see some of the stuff he names like his projects and stuff, he definitely had -- he definitely knew he was really good at what he was doing. All right. So this is his first job. He began a series of part-time jobs, including writing obituary notices for a new service.

How did it happen? How did I get into this? Me, a guy who's almost always written fantasy, suddenly having to deal with facts-the facts of my life. Although, come to think of it, those facts themselves are pretty fantastic. If I hadn't lived the whole thing I might not even believe it. During those strange, struggling, early years, I wallowed in embarrassment because I was a mere comic book writer. And now, because of those same humble comic books, here I am the featured star of a real, grown-up book, the hero of my own life story. There's probably a moral hidden there. Feel free to search for it as we roll along. To tell the truth, I can't wait to read the pages that follow. Since so much of the past has managed to homogenize in the plot-cluttered recesses of my mind, it's a chance to rediscover little truths about my own inscrutable self and the titanically talented people I've worked with. Here are a couple of sentences I wrote some years ago to describe my feelings about what Marvel Comics represents. Marvel is a cornucopia of fantasy, a wild idea, a swashbuckling attitude, an escape from the humdrum and prosaic. It's a serendipitous feast for the mind, the eye, and the imagination, a literate celebration of unbridled-creativity, coupled with a touch of rebellion and an insolent desire to spit in the eye of the dragon. There you have it, my take on Marvel and the fantasy genre in general, and perhaps my own philosophy in particular. If those words strike a chord with you, read on. If they don't, I'd rather not know.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. That was an excerpt from the book that I want to talk to you about today, and that is Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee. And I guess I'll just jump ahead before I jump back into the book because that's a bizarre word, right, like the title of the book. I don't know if I've ever even seen that word anywhere else. And so I looked it up, and he talks about it later on the book, but there's 2 things. First, I want to tell the definition. And second, he has a really great idea right off the bat. And he decided to make the word Excelsior, which means ever upward his life motto. But I also love the idea of having a life motto. And that's something I want to think about and see if I can come up with one of my own. Maybe you want to do the same. Okay. So as you could just see from that little excerpt, this guy, I mean, no surprise. He -- I was going to say, he's a hell of a writer, which -- I mean, that's kind of obvious. He built what is now what a multi-hundred billion dollar industry. Based off of his ideas and the creation of characters like Spider-Man, X-Men, the Avengers, which I think just overtook and is now the most -- like the highest-grossing movie of all time. And what I love most about the book and what you're going to come to learn over the next a little bit of our time together is that we're seeing -- as with all these biographies, we see the end result. So everybody knows who Stan Lee is now. Everybody knows who Marvel Comics are even if you're not into the movies of the books. But what I loved about reading this book so much is that the vast majority of his life, he was filled with unbelievable doubt. And he talks about right from -- he says during the strange struggling early years, I wallowed in embarrassment because I was a mere comic book writer. So I'm going to talk a lot about that today because I found that probably the most interesting part of the book. So I want to start where I always do, which is the Early Life, I try to always do. And we're going to see that some of the unpleasantness of his Early Life actually benefited him later on. So not only do I have this book, but I have another biography of his called the Amazing Fantastic Incredible, A Marvelous Memoir by Stan Lee that I'll probably turn into another episode of founders in the future.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But in that book, he talks about the unpleasantness of his -- like the relationship between his parents gave him one hell of a work I think, and we're going to see what he means by that. He says, I always felt sorry for my father. He was a good man, honest and caring. He wanted the best for his family as most parents do, but the times were against him. At the height of the depression, there were just no jobs to be had. ''Seeing the demoralizing effect that his unemployment had on his spirit, making him feel that he just wasn't needed, gave me a feeling I've never been able to shake.'' It's a feeling that the most important thing for a man, and I would also add a person, he's writing this book in 2002 when he's 80 years old. He hasn't passed away, he is 95. So let me just interject there. Again, it's a feeling that most important thing for a person is to have work to do, to be busy, to be needed. Today, I never feel more fulfilled than when I'm working on a number of projects at once, which is really nuts because I'm always wishing I had more free time. Still, when I'm busy, I feel needed, and that makes me feel good. So he's going to reflect a little bit about like what it was like growing up during the depression and seeing his parents struggle and frankly argue constantly about money and the lack thereof of money. They were both good, loving parents, and I think the only thing that gave them any pleasure was their children. My brother and I always regretted that fate had not been kinder to them and that they couldnâ€™t have had happier lives. I think that's like the greatest strategy in life to waste the one life you have and to spend it being miserable and unhappy. And unfortunately, I think that's like the default. For most of the humans that have ever lived. I think the estimate I read one time was like it might be about 105, 115 billion humans that have ever existed. And I mean, what percentage of them had a truly happy fulfilled life, probably a very small percentage, very hard to do.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

All right. They must have loved each other when they were married, but my earliest recollections were of the two of them arguing, quarreling incessantly. Almost always it was over money, or the lack of it. I realized at an early age how the specter of poverty, the never-ending worry about not having enough money to buy groceries or to pay the rent, can cast a cloud over a marriage. I'll always regret the fact that by the time I was earning enough money to make things easier for them, it was too late. And he talks about like reflecting like one of his earliest memories of his father is, his father sitting at the kitchen table, going through the one ads, spending all day applying for jobs, coming back with no luck, and then doing it over and over and over again. And I just want to read this one sentence and just standard so a wonderful way with words. And this was his impression as a young person seeing this happened as family says, "Forced idleness is a terrible thing." That's a hell of a sentence. And you know it's weird, though, to me now that I've read the book. So he was definitely not idle. I think I talked a little bit about later on, but in case I don't, you basically wrote all day long every day constantly. And he didn't necessarily enjoy the process of writing because he's like an extrovert, gregarious person, you want to be around people when you're writing, you have to be kind of alone. But he definitely enjoyed the process of having written, which I've come across a couple of times, where even some of my favorites writers, I don't really like writing, I just like the fact that I have written. So there's a lesson there. But this whole idea about seeing -- so the Forced idleness, he was definitely never idle. Even he's reflecting on some of the projects he's taking on when he's in the 70s at the time, he just kept going, going and going. But this whole idea about he realized from an early age about what the absence of money can do to a family. So Stan was never poor, but he definitely never captured even -- he captured a tiny percentage of the value that he would create.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He talked about several times in the book that he was just -- he was a creative person. He was really good at making stories and writing and doing that, but he constantly got ripped off by better -- or taking advantage of a better business spend. Okay. So let me skip ahead. Sometimes you're going to hear Stan refer to himself, like when I'm reading, that's the words he wrote. He also has a co-author in the book, and his name is George Mair. And so whenever we're talking about Stan, that's George writing. So George is writing this. He says, even in those difficult times, there's one joyful thing for Stan. It was the thing that eventually changed his life forever. It was his love for reading, for losing himself in the magical world of books. Okay. Now we're going to get the Stan's description of that. He said, "I can't remember when I first learned to read, nor can I remember a time when I wasn't reading. It was my escape from the dreariness and sadness of my home life. I read everything I could find, everywhere, every chance I got. In school, reading and composition were always my best subjects. At every meal at home, breakfast, lunch, or dinner I'd have a book or magazine to read while I ate. My mother used to say that if there was nothing to read, I'd read the labels of ketchup bottles, which I did. And then we're going to hear that as we're not surprised that all Stan was kind of a misfit like he was an outsider. He didn't fit in. He was a weird person. And I mean weird in the most loving way possible. And then we're going to learn about a lesson that he never forgot. So he said "In school, I was always something about outsider. That's because I usually -- I was usually the youngest kid in my class and in my social group." So as parents didn't have any money. They made him study really hard. So if you could basically skip grades and finish school faster so they he can get to work and help the family. So this is part of the impact of the depression had on families like mine. My mother wanted me to finish school as soon as possible so I can get a job and help support the family, which is another reason I had to work ethic drummed into me at an early age.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Now he is probably, I think it was like 14, 15 years old that time. Then that led to a job writing publicity for the National Tuberculosis Hospital, which is kind of weird. And then he also got a job at a movie theater being an usher. So he is just doing whatever he would take whatever work he could get at that time, even if he didn't like it. But in the case of the movie being an usher is one of his favorite jobs. Okay. So this is -- now we're going to -- he's graduated high school, and we're in the year in 1939, Stan is 17 years old. And this is how he finds his life's work. And the bulk of the podcast is going to be us reflecting on how he feels about its life's work because I think that was the most fascinating part about the book and the most surprising to me. He says, "My uncle, Robbie Solomon, told me they might be able to use someone at a publishing company where he worked. The idea of being involved in publishing definitely appealed to me because he like to read and write." I began working as a gofer for eight dollars a week at the small company located in the McGraw-Hill building at 42nd Street and Ninth Avenue in Manhattan. "I didnâ€™t realize it at the time, but I had embarked on my lifeâ€™s career." Okay, so this is how he becomes a comic book writer by accident. Then my big break happened. As the number of comics expanded, there was more work than Joe and Jack could handle. These are the people working. The place is called -- it changes names multiple times before it becomes Marvel. So I guess I should bring that up. I didn't know Stan Lee is not technically a founder of Marvel Comics. But as you'll see, he worked there for 40 years. He was the one -- he was the editor. He was the man in charge doing everything else. And most at the time, most of the people that -- like the company was sold 5 or 6 different times before Disney owns it. And they were just like shuffling executives. They didn't pay much attention to like the creative department, even though the creative departments are the ones actually creating the products that gave them all the profits that they would collect.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And they would say dumb things like, oh, like business people are much more valuable than you stand, you'd even talk like down to them, which is really silly, especially in today's day and age when we know that product is so important and they say stuff like, oh, if I raise the price of a common from $0.12 to $0.15 that one act by me will make more -- make us more money than everything you do in a year. And it's like, well, no, it wouldn't because if you didn't have Stan Lee writing all these novel -- he's the one that came up with Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four and the Avengers and all these other people like you go out and play golf all day. Like you may own the company, but you're definitely not the most important person there. So to me, I think -- and to a lot of people when they think of Marvel Comics, they think of Stan Lee. So just keep , he didn't technically start the company. I mean he did get equity way, way, way later after getting screwed over a couple of times, but he is the founder of Marvel for all intents and purposes. So at the time, I think it's called like -- I can't remember. I didn't -- it's called good old -- it's called Timely is the name of the company. So he's being a gofer and then they're like, "Hey kid, we have too much work to do. Will you write some stuff. He's like, yes, of course, I would love to. And so he says, my first story appeared in Captain America #3, which was dated May 1941. My first actual comic book script which came two issues later in Captain America #5, which was dated in August 1941. I was barely out of high school, and I was now a full-fledged comic book writer. Now this is interesting because his real name is not Stan Lee. It's like Stan Lieber. And he's got -- so one thing I think we -- another thing I think we could all learn from Stan is like if you're -- especially if you want to start one thing you want to be an entrepreneur, you want to be creative whether you want to run a one person business, you want to run a giant company. You just want to do your own thing and have freedom like I just think you should opt into optimism, even if that's not your natural personality because like if you're optimistic about your future possibilities, then you have a chance of getting there.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But the people that right off the bat are negative and they are like "Oh, it's never going to work, and they come up with all the reasons are going to work." Well, we know those are like self-fulfilling prophecies. So being negative is a self-fulfilling prophecy. It doesn't mean to be optimistic as a self-fulfilling prophecy, but it gets you closer there than ever. And Stan was -- he had -- like I called it hilarious levels of optimism, and you see this as a really young person. And this story illustrates us perfectly because he decides to come up with the name Stan Lee because he didn't want to ruin his real name for when he writes The Great American Novel. He's 17, and this is how he's thinking. So he says, "I had decided that nothing would stop me from one day writing The Great American novel. Typical, isn't it? A guy gets a few comic book scripts under his belt and decides he's the next Hemingway. Being only 17 at the time and not yet having become the incredible sophisticated and knowledgeable super person that I am today, he says it ingests, but he does really believe that he's special. And again, I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with that. I somehow felt it would not be seemly to take my name, which was certain to one day win a Pulitzer and sign it to mere, humble comic strips. So context before I finish that comic book -- anyway I worked in the comic book industry in the 1940s and around this time, They really can embarrass, people are like, "Oh, what do you do, I'm a graphic illustrator or I'm a writer because they were seen as like just -- there was no prestige. There was no prestige and like if you wrote a novel or a book or if you had like a shiny nice magazine. But comic books, which is interesting because I'm going to get into a little bit like the sheer numbers that they sold, which is just mindboggling. I mean 800,000 copies and issue kind of thing. But it was still frowned upon and kind of like -- it reminds me of when I read Anthony Bourdain's book Kitchen Confidential, like now shafts are like the show TV shows about them, we look up to them, people travel all over the world to eat their food and he's like, "That's not how it was.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Anthony Bourdain was talking like, that's not how it was when we started. Like the restaurant industry was an industry of misfits and drug addicts and people that were way out of mainstream. Funny Danny Meyer, if you remember the podcast I did on him, he said very similar things. That's why even though he was a -- he was in love of food, and he would love to own a restaurant. He never thought it was a possibility because he want -- people say, no, go be an attorney because it's more prestigious. And I saw -- I don't remember where it was, but I think I heard on a podcast somebody said like, you know how -- you know you're doing the wrong thing is if you're doing anything for Prestige and I was like damn that's a really good, simple idea because that's the wrong motivating factor. You shouldn't be doing it because what other people think about you. All right. So he said, "Listen, I'm going to win a Pulitzer, I can't use his name. So thus, I was caught up in the fantasy of using a pen name, something suitable for strips while saving my real name for the saga that would make me immortal. And that's how Stan Lee was born. He actually eventually changes his name. So that's his real name. Okay. So there's a bunch of notes I left myself on here. Let me just read them. So timing is critical. The comic book business was booming plus, impatience is a virtue plus a good idea. So let's see what the hell it was talking about. Okay. So this is crazy. So Martin Goodman is the guy. Martin Goodman is married to Stan's Cousin. That's the company he starts working at, and that's called Timely at the time. Martin Goodman -- I mean, we'll learn more about him later on. But the way he described when we kept referring to them as his friend, but the way he describes as like this, you guys don't sound very friendly, and I could see that. They weren't really friendly. But anyways, publishers, he's a publisher. He runs like other stuff. His comic books as one of the things, but he also like does like they call like glossy or something like that, like basically highly produced glossy magazines but check out the size of the market and this is still in the 1940s.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I just stayed with it occasionally wondering where was all leading to, I could never have imagined how it would all shake out. Okay. Now he's got more advice. So maybe this is a better way to put it. So well, first he talks about why you can work so fast. So let me get their first. He says, "I was doing so much of the writing myself and if I may be totally candid, I'm my own biggest fan." Since I liked everything I wrote, there wasn't that much editing needed. So I've been using the word confidence, arrogance, whatever you want to use, optimism. I think that's a better way to put it. Like what I was really trying to get to is like, especially if you're standing outside of the norm and you want to do something different, something that's just not copying whatever like the tracks are laid down for everybody else, like I don't see a reason not to be your own biggest fan even if you're not -- like you may not be producing the quality of work that you want to now, but being your own biggest fan, like assuming you're not like lazy and giving up, like you can grow into that quality. And I just -- I don't know, I think Stan hit on something. It's weird because he's his own biggest fan and at the same time, simultaneously, he's doubtful that his life's work means anything. So this is just another reminder, we're hearing some of his inner monologue here before he becomes a Stan Lee, we all know that it took him time to realize that he's already found what he should be doing with his life. And that was just mind-blowing to me, not knowing his life story before this. It's perfectly normal to have doubts. Stan Lee had doubts for 4 decades -- maybe not 4, 30 years, whatever it is close to that. It's a long time. I say, the 2 things I didn't love about my life were the one hour commute and the feeling that I wasn't getting ahead the way I should be, the haunting feeling that was only a moderately successful hack, think about that. Think about how he's describing himself. That's insane, right? Let's say, that's what I mean about like the reason it's so like I love the fact that human nature doesn't change.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

By the middle of the war, meaning World War II, publishers were selling 25 million comic books a month. That blew my mind. I had no idea. All right. Says "I've always been a fast writer mainly because of my impatience and wanting to get finished as soon as possible." So this is a description of what I meant earlier when he says that he didn't like writing, but he likes having written. "Also, I'm a gregarious guy. I like being with people, talking to people, even arguing with people. But I can't do that when I'm writing. Writing is about as lonely as an activity as you can find. So that's why you're so fast." "So I wrote my little training films and a structure -- oh, I'm sorry, I skipped over something. He's working at Timely, but then he's drafted into the army. And then he was convinced that he was going to go, and he wanted to actually go. So even if he wasn't drafted, he would have signed up, but maybe he did sign up, I don't actually remember. But interesting parts, he thought he was going to go fight and somehow he got classified as a playwright as a screen -- like a screenwriter. And so there wasn't any screenwriters in the Army. So the army doesn't send them to fight. They have him, they're like, "Hey, we need -- we have a bunch of conscripts, people that like don't have any idea what the military is about, and we need to like train them." So they made like films and instruction manuals. And so that's what Stan did. And the good idea, I mean, is how he was able to keep his job at Timely while he was still in the Army, and we're going to see that, that ties into how fast he works. He says, "So I wrote my little training films and instruction manuals the same as I've always written everything else as fast as I could. I never expected that one day the officer in charge would tell me to take it easy because others in our unit were turning out the material at a much lower pace. And I was making a look as if they were dragging their feet. Well, since I had to slow down, that left me with lots of spare time on my hands. And it was then that an idea hit me. If there wasn't enough military work for me, I decided to outmaneuver the Army by doing freelance scripts for Timely Comics. Unlike many men who went to war, I didn't leave my job. I took it with me.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. So and I'm skipping ahead a little bit, and this is actually important I think, because we always talk about like almost all of the people that we cover on the podcast were criticized heavily at the time. I don't know if Stan was criticized. I think most of his criticism was self-criticism, just feeling that he was wasting his time. But the note I put myself is there's always opportunity and things that will rot your brain, so I'm going to tell you what I mean about that. And then this is a good way to not care what other people think. He says, "Well, I really enjoyed my job and the stories I was writing. There was one thing that both irritated and frustrated me. It was the fact that nobody had a good word to say about comic books. Remember, this is still after the fact that you're selling 25 million a month. So part of me is like Stan just look at your sales numbers, like they clearly enjoy it, but I think he was meaning the larger overall sort of society. And I guess he says that here. "To the public at large, comics were at the very bottom of the cultural totem pole." Most of the adult world didn't buy them, didn't care about them, and didn't want their children to waste their time reading them. I tried to tell myself that it wasn't all bad because the next day I'd be immersed in a world of fantasy and imagination, doing work that was fun and absorbing, while many of the people who denigrated comics couldn't make that claim for themselves. That's what that specific paragraph is what I mean about why you don't care what other people think. If somebody is close to you, somebody respects giving you constructive criticism that's one thing. But the idea is like, well, you're -- I'm enjoying with the work I do. He's not making much money at the time. Most of the money is going to the owner of the company, unfortunately, but he's immersed in a world of fantasy and imagination and the people criticize it like he's loving what he's doing and most of the people are criticizing surely can't say the same thing. And this whole idea about most of the adult world didn't want them buying them, reading them. I heard this idea, and I took a note on it. So let me pull that up for you real quick. So this really interesting person I've come across on Twitter recently, he's been on a couple of podcasts. His name is Josh Wolfe. He's an investor, I think, in Lux Capital. Let me just read the quote from this podcast. He says "The most valuable words in investing are, it will rot your brain. When those words are uttered by a parent, it presages the next $10 billion industry."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

As he goes and gives examples StarTimes, says Rock and Roll in like the 70s, TV in the 80s, the Internet, video games, I would add comic books to that because think about how valuable, we are you still in the 40s, maybe the 50s at this point in the book? And now fast forward 60 years later, whatever the case is, however, 70 years, whatever it is. How valuable is the comic book like just take Marvel alone. Like the intellectual property that Marvel has developed. You're talking about they've made, what, tens of billions of dollars, if not more, now it's going to be more than that between all the comic books, strips, newspaper, turned into like a daily newspaper, strip that Stan Lee was doing for like 20 years every day. Just the amount of money it would generate is fascinating. So that $10 million number is actually a little low. Okay. So there's 2 important things in this one paragraph. First, this is going to be Stan's advice on writing. And then as we see with most of the people that go on and do amazing things, they studied the history of their profession, whether they read books about it like Elon Musk suggest that's part of where I got the idea to do this podcast because when Elon Musk asked, hey, like how did you learn about business, you read business books. He's like, "No, I look for help in a historical context, books basically are like biographies." Learning from people like in their profession that came before them. So Stan studied the great writers. And he said, now this is the co-author George describing Stan's advice to writing. Just yet his advice to writers who sound then and remain so now. It is boiled down to these rules. One, have a provocative beginning; two, use smooth continuity from panel to panel; three, concentrate on realistic dialogue which leads to good characterization, four, maintain suspense throughout and five, provide a satisfying ending.

That pretty much well up sums it up the way Euripides, Shakespeare and Hemingway did it. And of course, it was the way Stan endeavored to do it all during his career. Okay. So now we have here Stan reflecting on, he's still in the thick of it. Again, comic books are selling, but they're not really respected. And self-doubt is the largest -- I mean this is a biography on Stan Lee and I think his co-star is the self-doubt, which is fascinating, considering how successful what he created turns out to be. But he has his point, he's like, listen, I don't want to copy. I want to create. And unfortunately, he's working for somebody that only gives -- like they don't care about what they're doing. They just want to make a dollar, and they'll do that by first seeing what other people are doing and then quickly copying. She says, I was writing many, if not most of the stories and I admit I enjoyed the variety. Yet I said to myself, none of this is making an impression on anybody. We were reasonably successful. We made some money, but what bothered me is that we were always following the trends, never setting them that changes later, and I'll tell you more about that. Martin Goodman, that's the owner of the company he works for, would merely check the sales figures of all the various comic-book companies, see what was selling well and then say to me, "You know Stan, everyone else's knitting story seem to be selling well, so let's do books about knitting." Then at some later date, he'd say the funny animal books are doing well. So we switched to funny animal books. That's sounds like a terrible place to work, doesn't it? It went on and on and on. Every few months a new trend, and we'd be right there faithfully following each one. I hated that word following. Even though it was a good job and I enjoyed working with all the artists and other writers, it really wasn't creatively fulfilling. I felt that we are a company of copycats. We'd see what type of comics were selling well, and then we'd flood the market with new titles in that same vein. But it was a job, I was good at it and things could have been worse.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Was that what a grown man, a husband and father should seriously be doing? I told Joanie that's his wife how I felt, and she was totally sympathetic. She said "She could understand if I felt burned out. After all, she knew how many years I've been working at the same job, and she knew how much pressure I was constantly under to turn out script after script." She also understood that I felt somewhat like a DJ in a small town. I was sitting at the mic getting the message out, but was anybody listening, did anybody care? I felt I was wasting my adult life and whatever little talent I might possess on a job that wasn't all that meaningful. I was just making a living nothing more. This is a dangerous thing about our mind. Our mind plays tricks on us. Like we have these little seeds of self-doubt of anxiety of depression that can sit there. And again, I'm just going to keep bringing this up on the podcast because like I know people that are listening to us feel that way, too. I've felt that way and I'm sure I will in the future, but it's not real. That is not actually happening. You have to step back and take -- and learn from like using history as like give yourself additional context and realize that everybody feels this way, even if they're not going to talk to you about it. I mean we're really lucky that Stan Lee has been so honest. And there is something to be said about a lot of the autobiographies that we've covered on the podcast where they usually get to a certain age will they reflect back, and it's not all glorifying. Look, how special I am, I created Nike or I created Walmart or I created Marvel, they all talk about the regrets they had, the stuff they wish they could have done differently. And I think that's super valuable because by that age, the past is done, you can't really do anything about it. But if we understand that most people have these regrets, and they're usually the same kind of regret whatever again, usually I wish you spend more time with family, maybe I didn't -- maybe shouldn't have worked this hard et cetera, et cetera, or worked as much rather. It's inevitable if we're not heating that advice that we're going to feel the same way.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I think like that's one thing I don't want to do. I don't want to have a lot of regrets when I'm older, and you probably don't either. Okay. Skipping ahead. Oh, he's got some great â€“ he's just such a -- he's an amazing writer even like go back to like let me go back to the beginning because I want to read that -- I wasn't planning on doing this, but I can't -- I want to save that. I'm going to take a picture of this the way he describes his -- what he describes. I'm going to read what he -- how he describes Marvel Comics because listen to words, cornucopia, swashbuckling, humdrum, prosaic, serendipitous feast of the mind. So it says Marvel is a cornucopia of fantasy, a wild idea, a swashbuckling attitude and escape from the humdrum and the prosaic, it's a serendipitous feast for the mind, the eye and the imagination, a literate celebration of unbridle creativity, coupled with a touch of rebellion and an insolent desire to spit in the eye of the dragon. Whatever you say about that paragraph, if you like it or you don't, you'd kind of remember it. And I think he was extremely good at marketing and promotion. A lot of the book is actually dedicated to the fact that he felt his bosses didn't know anything about it. So for an example, why we came up with that weird Excelsior motto. He started -- Timely Marvel is the first one company to realize, hey, we have a lot of fans, why don't we create some kind of club where we can communicate with them and then we get special things like pins and letters for me. And like behind the scenes of how we make the comic books they love; it winds up being really successful and then his boss made him shut it down because they were shortsighted and silly. But he's talked about how he would communicate with his fans. It's just like a person like I didn't talk like a business because I'm not a business, I'm a person. So he started using these words, I think he noticed other comic book companies copy that. So they would use like his folksy language. He's like, "Well, now I need something like I clearly see they're stealing from me, copying from me rather."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I need to make it obvious. So that's why he went to Latin. He's like, well, if they use the word Excelsior, then clearly know that they're saying, "Hey, I got to say you from Stan. Okay. So anyways, I just went on a weird tangent because this is a great sentence. Sometimes mediocrity can be as disappointing as failure. The experience taught me an important lesson. I learned that a person's opinion isn't necessarily right just because he happens to have an important title or be the head of a company. I was determined never to try to create something according to somebody else's lights if I didn't feel comfortable doing it. So it's more of the like allowing other people to infringe upon his creative outlet he wanted to do like a comic strip about like a big-city New York cop because he grew up in the Manhattan for most of his life, so that's what he felt he knew. And then other people convinced them to change it to like -- it was going to be something called Barney's Beat, like the cop beat. And then they changed it to like a sort of a hip, big city cop, they wanted Barney to be a small town mailman. And it was called a Willie Lumpkin this is terrible." And he's like, "I'm making work that I don't give a c_*_ about and that's why it comes up with sometimes mediocrity it can be as disappointing as failure. Okay. So now we've got to the turning point of Stan's life. Remember, most of the book, he's talking about the interesting things he creates, but then he shares multiple examples of just complete dissatisfaction with his life. So this is a turning point of his life. By the early 1960s, my urge to quit the comic book field had become stronger than ever. So think about that. He was -- let's see, when was he born, just check real quick.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Oh, no, on Google to pull up his Wikipedia page to find his birthday, one of the headlines as Stan Lee's former business manager charged with elder abuse against late icon. That's terrible. Okay. So 2019, '22. Okay. So he's almost 40 years old before he reaches the turning point of his life. It's actually a really important part of the book. I'm going to read a lot from here. Okay. So my urge to quit the comic book field have become stronger than ever. The titles were no longer selling the large numbers they once did. As far as I could tell, the comic book industry was in trouble. I thought we were merely doing the same type of thing over and over again with no hope of either greater financial rewards or creative satisfaction. But, as so often happens, a tiny, almost unnoticed pivotably event can change the course of a person's life. This particular pivotal event was a chance golf game between Martin Goodman, remember that's the guy that own this company, and Jack Leibowitz, the publisher of National Comics. Leibowitz casually mentioned to Martin, the new series that National had introduced, The Justice League of America, consisting of a team of superheroes, including Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, all in one book was selling surprisingly well. He thought it might indicate a resurgence of reader's interest in the superhero genre, especially in teams of superheroes. He rushed in to see me as soon as he returned to the office. ''Stan,'' he said excitedly, ''can you come up with a team of superheroes like the Justice League, now how crazy is this? This is happening in 1961. That is, of course, he's going to come up with the Avengers and the Avengers will now, let's say, 70, 80, 90, 50 years later become the most popular -- most highest grossing movies of all time. Coincidentally, it was that very afternoon that I had been planning to tell him that I wanted to leave the company. I finally decided it was getting too old to be turning out simplistic comic books day after day. That's what he means about an unnoticed pivotal event can change your life.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Martin caught me off guard with his enthusiasm for creating a new superhero title. He was so fired up about it that I couldn't bring myself to tell him I wanted out. I decided to let it go the next day. And this is when he gets an absolute genius piece of advice from his wife that changes his life and changes now after this day, Stan comes from being like doubting he was doing right and miserable, like just being like this hack, he call himself to just saying, you know what, I have -- I know I have nothing left to get like I have zero f_*_ left to give and now I'm just going to do things at how I want to do it. And this becomes the birth of the Marvel Universe because what he does here. She goes. So that night, I told Joanie my decision. She was completely supportive but then she added something I hadn't thought of. You know Stan, if Martin wants you to create a new group of superheroes, this could be your chance for you to do it the way you've always wanted to. You could dream up plots that have more depth and substance to them and create characters who have interesting personalities who speak like real people. It's so such a key. Then she said something that should have occurred to me right away, and it was the thing that made up my mind. ''Remember, you've got nothing to lose by doing the book your way.'' ''The worst that can happen is that Martin will get mad and fire you; but you want to quit anyway, so what's the risk? At least you've gotten it out of your system.'' That did it. My mind was made up. So then this is the birth of him writing superheroes before that, they were all perfect. They'd be like you have the Superman. He's good looking. He has no like very few weaknesses, handsome, strong, et cetera, et cetera. You start making these people that are kind of neurotic like the Fantastic 4, where the lead guys, he's like he talks too much. He annoys the people around them. You got things like this ugly creature. You have Peter Parker Spider-Man, who's like has same insecurities that all teenagers have and he's not good with girls and all this other stuff that kind of makes them more human like, they just happen to have weird powers.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. So this is an example of what I was saying earlier about I understand that most people prefer modesty, but I'm not necessarily sure if I believe that's the best advice for entrepreneurs or people that are being creative. And I don't mean like -- so to me, when people are saying like, if people are not humble enough, I think that you could be extremely confident like Stan Lee was, but still be humble in the sense that like to me humility is the understanding that like you don't know everything, and you can still learn from other people. So you could be confident in your abilities and still be receptive that other people and other events have stuff to teach you. So it says Stan was -- and this is an example of like this guy clearly, he had a high level like he was his own big fan. He's already told us that, right? So Stan with a bundle of optimism after launching his new group of superheroes. He started telling everyone who listened that the Fantastic Four was going to be known as the best superhero comic book ever produced. Go on. That is hilarious. And he does this extremely early, watch this. It arguably attained that exalted status by the time it reached the third issue, at which point, Stan began to think his braggadocio might actually have been too modest. Therefore, on the cover of issue #3, he dared to print in the hyperbole, he's so dearly loved, these imperishable words above the masthead: "The World's Greatest Comic Magazine." He did that what is this 1960s? So in my other hand, you can't see have a book of the book in my left hand, published in 2002. That's his first autobiography, the second one where he talked about this first autobiography, he's going to have to write another one, so he did, he doesn't write until 2015. In that hand, it's one of the most beautiful books. I didn't know it's written like a graphic novel. So I might just do this at a bonus misfit episode for you guys since your support means everything to me.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But anyways, I mean, listen to what he named is memoir, ''Amazing Fantastic Incredible: A Marvelous Memoir,'' I mean this guy is hilarious. He's really hilarious. So yes, that's the same kind of personality that will say, "Hey, the issue #3, you end up being close to right the world's greatest common magazine. But he makes a good point here. He's like, "Listen, there are no hard and fast rules concerning greatness, a condition which is generally in the eye of the beholder. I thought it was one of the best things we had done to date, and I wanted the world to know it. That's actually a good point. Like no one's going to agree on what's great is it's objective. So why don't you just say that if you believe in the work that you're doing, and he was definitely a market and a promoter like it's going to get people's attention. That's why you go to any city anywhere. It's like the world's greatest pizza, the world's best bagel, America's best this. It's like, come on man, that's not real, but it's surprisingly effective. All right. Let's see. Okay. So this is actually -- so I have this quote. I say it all time. I clearly have borrowed it from somebody else. I don't remember who or where now at this time. But I always tell people, humans scoring the abstract. And that -- there's a weird value in things that are not just numbers and he -- so he says this wildly successful. Basically, he thought he's like, why does Marvel have something that's like the -- what was it called the Disney had, The Mickey Mouse Club like a club where like you're basically a super fan of this. It's actually interesting that he compares Marvel Disney considering 1.5 decades later or whatever, Disney buys Marvel. But when I mean about human scoring the abstract, he was like he had this great idea. He's like, listen, like we have a massive like enthusiastic community, we need to cultivate. And now think about every single company nowadays is trying to build that same thing, they are trying to build like a community because you realize that like that's a great pathway to building a business in a modern age.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Well, Stan understood that a long time ago. Anyways, so he had 2 of them almost like the "M.M.M.S." like mighty Marvel something or another Society and then another one after that one was canceled, he did it again. It's called FLOOM, "Friends of Ol' Marvel." Both times, the number of crunches at Marvel, so no reason to continue. It wasn't losing money, but it wasn't a profit center. And it was like, well, there's no way for you to track it at that time, whether it was a profit center or not? Like it was an attraction. You had to just believe in it. Well, people -- they're -- they're not creative and capable of thinking that way. And this is a lot of humans, they just score in the abstract. It's like, oh, it's a weird thing. If it's not like tangible right in front of us, like this has a price on it or this is a return, they get confused by it. But Stan is like, no, I really believe in my heart, this is where we should be spending resources that it will pay off in the future. Very much sounds like a Jeff Bezos quote or like a Mark Spitznagel quote if you listen to the Dao of Capital One. So it's a shame. I always felt that Marvel could have and should have one day rival Disney. If only those who control the purse strings that understood the value of promotion and public relations. We had what every company dreamt of having a fervent, fanatical fan following all over the country and throughout the world, yet nobody in the executive suites knew what to do with an invaluable resource except just keep publishing the books and hope they'd sell. They didn't seem to understand the value of having a great fan base. They didn't seem to realize it was necessary to nurture those fans to keep their loyalty and enlist their support. They never seem to be aware of how vital was to maintain contact with those who cared about us because fans can be the most elusive affirm group in the world and the suits didn't get it. Now I'd also say it's interesting how this kind of phenomenon, this abstraction can compound over time. If you just try to do Avengers today, movie and nobody knew it was, wouldn't sell, but the fact that you've been building on these stories and increasing the fan base and constantly producing more stories involving the same characters allows it to build to the point where you can have the highest grossing movie or one of the most popular attractions or whatever it is.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And like you just have no idea how much like value that is to people. These things like we cannot predict what -- like what we're passionate about and how those passions affect us later in life. So he is talking about like even in the first -- when they did the first like Fan Club, "M.M.M.S." you would get like a pin, right? And like people would wear them on their shirts and stuff like that. And so later on, Stans like going into a meeting to do like a joint venture with another company and the people that called in the meeting that came up with the idea, he walks in his meeting with 4 people. Every single one of them was a member of the M.M.M.S, and they still had their pin-like 30 years later. Like how valuable is that? Now this guy is getting an opportunity 3 decades in the future because he had an impact on somebody else's life 30 years prior. So I would just say like if you believe in like the human element of it, and you should because like you have to be good at entrepreneurship I think you have to understand -- fundamental to understand people. It's probably worth reinvesting in things that do not have any immediate return. Not probably. There definitely is. Okay. So now he's really happy. Now he's back. He's like, "I found it. He starts doing Spider-Man and a Fantastic Four. And then this is just a note, I've already trampled over this note, but I'll read it anyways, breaks box office records 55 years later. In 1963, we also gifted the reading public with the Avengers. It was another team of superheroes, but not new ones. And then think about how crazy this is. He came with Avengers out of laziness. He said, probably out of laziness, instead of dreaming up a whole new kaboodle of new characters. I simply took our already established and popular characters and had them form a team called the Adventures. I thought that was interesting.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

One, the time aspect of it, but a second like, I can make new characters, or I can just create new stories based on like how other characters relate to one another, which again is just a reflection of human. Think about all the different humans that you interact with and how those relationships then interact with each other, like you act differently with maybe your spouse, to your best friend to your coworkers to the people you play sports with or whatever the case is. Okay. Now he's going to give us a lesson in human nature, and it's -- he gets basically screwed over by Martin Goodman, and we're going to get in there. So this is in 1968. They changed the name from Timely to Marvel because Marvel was now -- as a result Stans work was making the vast majority of the money and Goodman decides he wants to sell. So he says, "Martin told me that perfect film was offering him between $12 million and $15 million in cash for Marvel, and that's $12 million to $15 million in $1968." So it's a lot of money today. It's a lot of money even at those numbers. But here's a kicker. Perfect told Martin, they wouldn't buy the company unless I sign a contract to stay on. Oh, yes, he's doing all the work, the vast majority of the work. One of my closest friends who happen to be a brilliant businessman, told me I was in a great position since my being under contract was "of the essence," for the sale being made. He said I could ask Martin for almost anything and he would have to give it to me. And this is Stan's response. Are you kidding? Martin may have his faults, but he is a friend. I worked for him for 20 years. I know he'll be fair." "Oh, really? You, Stan, have not learned." So he goes to have dinner after the sale. Remember his -- Martin's meritorious cousin. So it's Martin, Stan's cousin and Stan and his wife. Martin puts his arm around Stan, he says, ''Stan, I'll see to it that you and Joanie will never have to want for anything as long as you live, I'm going to make you a gift of some valuable warrants,'' which he said were somewhat like stock options. I figured.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

At last, this is my pot of gold. He's keeping his promise. As time went by, the warrants proved to be absolutely worthless. But it was even worse, although he said he would, he never actually gave them to me. Nor did he ever in any way make good on the promise that Joanie and I would never want for anything as long as we live. No bonus, no bonds, no warrants, either worthless or otherwise. Zilch, I guess there's a lesson to be learned there somewhere. So think about that. This guy gets unbelievably wealthy off of Stan's work and doesn't give him anything, not a dollar, nothing. And then leaves the company 2 years later. So he's about to leave the company. And now Marvel has been bought over and over again. So I'm not going to tell you the names. I guess -- so this other company buys it, and they morph into another conglomerate called Cadence. So he's still working for Cadence at the time. And Cadence decides, "Hey, we're going to give you a promotion Stan because you're so important, you're going to become a publisher. And a publisher was basically what Martin was, right? So Stan was like no, this is fantastic. Martin, let me just read it to you. But once again, Martin proved what a friend and grateful guy he was. He tried every way he could to prevent my becoming publisher because he had been hoping to give that job to his son. Still, despite all Martin can do, Cadence name me Publisher of Marvel Comics. What I'm about to tell you now is still hard after all these years for me to accept, but I swear it's true. When my promotion was announced, Martin actually had the goal to accuse me of this loyalty of betraying him after all he had done for me. That is tails all this time, remember, I always talk about this idea that we're not rational creatures, we're rationalizing. And those 2 are very -- they are very different things. We can't help but see things from our self-respect perspective.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Needless to say, by this time, I didn't care what Martin said or thought I was finally free to do what I always felt I could and should have done with Marvel, and that was all that mattered. It freed me up to begin devoting myself to promoting Marvel as it always felt it should be promoted. I wanted to bring our company to the next plateau to make it the next Disney. So then he hires a bunch of writers, editors, he gets away from writing basically all day nonstop and he goes out and promotes. And for 10 years, this is why we know Stan Lee. He would give like speeches to groups of people, whether it's like colleges, anywhere he could. And he was on the road for like 50 weeks out of 52 weeks a year. Just giving speeches, promoting Marvel, talking about that, cultivating fan bases all over the world, which is extremely, extremely smart on his behalf. And you could only imagine if they had been doing this forever. What the results would have been. I mean Marvel is a huge success story, a wonderful story, but it took Stan going out and talking to -- you did things that weren't didn't scale using that same as I say, do things that don't scale. Okay. This is interesting, real quick. Just the power of direct sales. And I think a lot of people skip out on. By the end of 1970s, comic books were so popular that stores specializing in comic books open in the neighborhoods throughout the country. I remember going to some of these when I was kid. In the comic-book trade, this distribution channel was called direct sales as opposed to the normal distribution system of a distributor, bringing comic books to the usual general magazine outlet. So they're having their own dedicated channel that are being lumped in with these other printed materials. Spotting a new booming market, Marvel actively focused on this sector. So he does things -- this is really smart, how he talks about it. Well, the result too is this increased Marvel sales by an additional 420,000 books a month.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The size, so cannot get over how many of these -- I mean they just can't get over how much they sold, it's insane. So it's one of the best things about direct sales was the fact that the comic book store -- this is a good point. I finally got to him. One of the best things about direct sales was the fact that the comic book store owners were Marvel's most effective salespeople. Stan felt he had a good product, but at convenience stores or new stands, it was lost among hundreds of other items. In contrast, the buyers who walk into a comic book store are already presold. They come in with the intention of buying a comic book. The question is not will they buy a comic, but how many and which ones. Marvel began putting and he does something really smart. Marvel began publishing comic books exclusively for the direct sales market, which gave the store owners still another reason to promote the company that was giving them an exclusive product that couldn't be purchased anywhere else. So not only do you have a complete alignment of incentives and realizing that the most effective salespeople are possible that people are working there because you have like a passion, a passionate person about it, but then you're adding on to that and giving them like rewarding them for doing them and what's going to happen in like feeds everything else. So not only are you going to sell your -- the ones that you do that are just produced exclusively for the sales channel, but all the other ones as well. So as which gave the store owners still another reason to promote the company that was giving them an exclusive product that couldn't be purchased anywhere else. Marvel helped the dealers and the dealers reciprocated. It seemed to be a powerful strategy. And then I'll close on this. And I think this is a really important part of the story, the fact that 30, 40 years of struggle and self-doubt. Stan's writing these words at almost 80. And I think he finally arrived at the Holy Grail, the thing that we're all looking for to have work that's so meaningful and enjoyable that there is no -- like you want to keep doing it.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And to that point, some final words from the life and wisdom of Stan Lee. The toughest part is, how I know where to end it? At what part of my life should I wrap it up? Says, I'm still insanely involved with the whole caboodle of projects at what point should I write ''The End.'' A person's career isn't like a movie. As long as you're live, there's no dramatic fade-out shot, accompanied by suitable music as the credits roll. And I'll be damned if I'll shrug off this mortal coil just to furnish you with a dramatic ending. Of course, I could always just retire and that would give the book a nice warm uncomplicated ending. In fact, people are always asking when I plan to retire. I always ask them retire to what? Most people retire in order to finally do the things they really want to do, but I'm already doing them. I can't think of anything better than tackling new movies, TV projects with a bunch of talented, enthusiastic creative people. So I'll leave a link in the show notes. If you want to buy this or any of the other books that I've covered on the podcast. Thank you very much for listening. Thank you for the support, and I will talk to you next week.

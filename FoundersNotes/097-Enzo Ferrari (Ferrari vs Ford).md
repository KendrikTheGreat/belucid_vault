"You have to have a lot of passion for what you're doing. And it's totally true. And the reason is, is because it's so hard that if you don't, any rational person would give up. It's really hard, and you have to do it over a sustained period of time. So if you don't love it, if you're not having fun doing it, you don't really love it, you're going to give up. And that's what happens to most people actually. If you really look at the ones that ended up being "successful" in the eyes of society and the ones that didn't. Oftentimes, it's the ones that are successful love what they did so they could persevere when it got really tough. And the ones that didn't love it, quit because they're sane, right? Who would want to put up with this stuff if you don't love it? So it's a lot of hard work, and it's a lot of worrying constantly. And if you don't love it, you're going to fail. So you got a love it and you got a passion." So the reason how this relates is that when he's building his company, he's going to have to go -- Enzo that is, he just has to go through problem after problem after problem. It's not like a straight lineup. And I think what caused him to never quit is the fact that he -- there was no separation in his life between what he was doing at Ferrari and living. And so I'll get into that now. So let me go back and jump into the book. So I need to talk -- I think the passion of Enzo has something to do with the city that he lived in and the one that he would rarely want to leave. And let me just give you a description of the city in Italy. It's called Modena. I might be pronouncing that incorrectly. But it says, now speaking about the city. "Its true fame, however, was its craftsman, absurdly gifted artisans abound so that you can have almost anything made, made surprisingly well and so cheaply that you must never get used to that miracle. As in all Italian cities and towns, the Modenese held beauty in great esteem. In this city, an old world aesthetic was joined by modernity's defining ambition to harness power."

"In 1963, following a business deal gone sour, two industrialists from either side of the Atlantic Ocean became embroiled in a rivalry that was played out at the greatest automobile race in the world. In its broad strokes, this book chronicles a clash of two titans. Henry Ford II of America and Enzo Ferrari of Italy at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The 24 Hours of Le Mans is a sports car race. But in the 1950s and 1960s, it was more than that. It was the most magnificent marketing tool the sports car industry had ever known. Renowned n manufacturers built street-legal machines that would prove on the racetrack that their cars were the best in the world. A win translated into millions in sales. It was a contest of technology and engineering of ideas and audacity. Success could only be achieved by the marriage of brilliant design and steel-willed courage. It would require a greasy-fingered visionary to run the show, a team of the most skilled drivers in the world, and the swiftest racing sports car ever to hurtle down a road, all things of which the optimistic Americans believed could be purchased with the all-mighty dollar."

Okay, so that's an excerpt from the book that I read this week and the one I'm going to talk to you about today, which is Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans and it was written by A.J. Baime. So I've been wanting to read this book for several months, and I decided to wait because there's a high-budget movie that's coming out next week starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, among others, about the story that's in the book. The name of that movie is Ford vs. Ferrari. And so what I'm going to do today is I'm going to use this book as the start of a two-part series that I want to do on Enzo Ferrari. So the parts that I picked out of the book the one that I want to talk to you about today has to do with what can we learn from the founder of Ferrari and his unique personality and the way he goes about things. And then next week, I'm going to go into what may be the longest book that I've ever read for the podcast. I have the hardcover. It's a biography of Enzo Ferrari. It's like 980-something pages. Maybe the -- when I read all of Warren Buffett's shareholder letters, that was probably a little longer. But it's going to be -- we're going to go into -- I'm going to go into much more detail next week. But this book is a great way to introduce us to who Enzo Ferrari was and to how he thought about building his business. So where I want to start is we're going to see -- so like I said before, I'm going to focus mainly on Enzo Ferrari. But if you happen to read this book, you're going to realize that there's an -- it's interesting because it's really comparing and contrasting the difference between a founder and a manager. So you have Henry Ford II, which is the grandson of Henry Ford, who is now taking over a company 60-something years after its founding. And he's going up against Enzo Ferrari, who has complete control over his small company. So I just want to read this section that really highlights what's going on, "Unlike the men who founded American car companies early in the century, Henry Ford, Ransom Olds, the Dodge Brothers. The auto men of the day didn't have to know how to design an engine" So they're talking about the people running the companies in the 1960s. "They did have to be good at math." And here's a quote from Ford's Vice President at the time. He says, "This is a nickel and dime business all the way through. A dime on 1 million units is $100,000. We'd practically cut your throat around here for a quarter. Companies were no longer run by the men whose names were on the cars." Okay. So as of today, I've done 3 podcasts on Henry Ford. I'll do at least another one in the future. If you haven't gone back and listened to them, it's Founders #9, #26, and #80. This time period is fascinating to me. And I'm eventually going to do podcasts on Ransom Olds and then the Dodge Brothers. I talked a little bit about the Dodge Brothers on a few of the Henry Ford podcasts because they're crazy, interesting people. So I want to compare now the way that Ford, the Ford organization is talking about their products, right? So they're saying, it's a Nickel and dime business.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And we're going to compare and contrast that to the passion that Enzo Ferrari has for the products that he's making, and it is completely different. And here's an example of that. "For Enzo Ferrari, the internal combustion engine was a symbol of life. It had revolutionized society. He had watched it all happen during his lifetime. He spoke of automobiles as if they were alive. Cars possess unique behaviors. They breathe through their carburetors. They were skinned with metal. 'Ferrari's aim,' he once told a reporter addressing himself in the third person, 'is to perfect and ideal to transform inert raw material into a living machine, the engine of a car was both heart and soul. Its rumble, the heartbeat of the creature." So when I read that section, one, Enzo Ferrari's passion is infectious. He comes across in the book way more -- even though he is kind of Machiavellian in nature, I was way more drawn to him and wanting to learn from him than the way Henry Ford II comes across in the book. But what I'm realizing by reading all these books is that we know that interest compounds, money can compound, time can compound, but knowledge also compounds. And so the more you expose yourself to all these ideas that all these entrepreneurs of the past have used in their life. You realize that those there's stroke that are the same and yet their applications can be infinitely different. So I saw this excerpt the other day, and I want to read to you. It has to do with how nature design things. And it says, "Nature is never modular. Nature is full of almost similar units, waves, raindrops, blades of grass, et cetera. But though the units of one kind are all alike in their broad structure, no two are ever alike in detail." So the authors list two ideas here. He says, "Number one, the same broad features keep recurring over and over again."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he's talking about nature. I would say that statement is exactly true if you study all these biographies. The same broad features keep recurring over and over again. "Number two, in their detailed appearance, these broad features are never twice the same." So those two statements could seem like they're in conflict, but the application of those ideas, these broad reoccurring themes lead us to millions and millions of essentially unlimited different variations of how these ideas can be applied in the real world. So let me give you an example of that with the author saying here, "On one hand, all oak trees have the same overall shape, the same thickened, twisted trunk, the same crinkled bark, the same shape leaves, the same proportion of limbs to branches to twigs. On the other hand, no two trees are quite the same. The exact combination of height and width and curvature never repeats itself. We cannot even find two leaves, which are exactly the same." Same thing goes for businesses. So why do I bring that up now? Because what immediately jumps to my mind, when I'm sitting here listening and reading about Enzo Ferrari, so I finished reading this book, I've already started reading his biography and it keeps reoccurring. He has a passion for cars at a very -- and for creating a product that is more akin to like a craftsman than like a CEO of a large company. And I think there's like a -- that passion is infectious and it's also like good marketing. When I hear a founder speak about their product in a way that Enzo speaks about his cars, even though I have no interest in his cars, you're more likely to be attracted to buy that product. And what it reminds me of is this quote, I'm going to play into the microphone right now from Steve Jobs that happen a few years before he died. And he talks about why having passion for what you're doing with the product you're making, the company you're creating, how you're spending your waking hours is so important. So I'm just going to play that you are really quick. It's about 55 seconds.

"It is my opinion, Ferrari once wrote, that there are innate gifts that are particular to a certain region and that transferred into industry, these propensities may at times acquire an exceptional importance. In Modena, where I was born and set up my own works," now listen to the sentence is going to say here, right? "In Modena, where I was born and set up my own works, there is a species of psychosis for racing cars. Ferrari was a metal workers son. His name came from the Italian word ferro, meaning iron. He would describe himself as neither a designer nor an engineer, but rather an agitator of men." Okay, so let's stop right here and think about what has already happened, right? We have Ford Vice President, we have -- it's being run by the grandson, saying nickel and dime, we're going to cut costs, we're going to keep it as low as possible and we're going to produce. I mean, that's essentially -- Henry Ford wanted to -- his quote is that I'm building a motor car for the multitudes, right? So he's going to create like the most basic car possible to spread it out to most people. Ferrari is doing essentially the same thing, Ford is making cars, Ferrari is making cars. They take two vastly different approaches, though. And even the way -- you could see it not only -- obviously, their philosophy is going to be played out in the products you make, right, but also the way they talk about those products. He's talking about basically having a love affair with this living creature that is the car versus oh, we're just going to cut costs and make the cheapest piece of crap that we can possibly produce. And what it reminding me of is when I was -- I took notes on this when Steve Jobs is 29 years old, he gave this long interview because they're releasing the Macintosh. Let me read another quote from him. He says, "We didn't build the Mac for anybody else. We built it for ourselves. We were the group of people who are going to judge whether it was great or not. We weren't going to go out and do market research." These car companies -- in the 1960s, American car companies are famous for doing that.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"We just wanted to build the best thing we could build. When you're a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you're not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces with the wall and nobody would ever see it. You will know it's there. So you're going to use a beautiful piece of wood in the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality has to be carried all the way through." So why am I going on and on about this? Because when you hear two people talking, think about it from a customer's perspective, what you're more likely to want to give your money to? The person that gives a shit about what they're doing, that's clearly all in, that's extremely passionate about it, or the person is saying, hey, we're just trying to make another black Model T and hopefully, we can do it at $0.10 cheaper next year than we did this year. It's just not comparable. All right. So let's go back into -- okay, so now we're going to start to see Ferrari's schedule. He's 58 years old at this time. And I'm going to tell you a little bit about his early life, but I'm going to more talk more about that next week. All right. Ferrari, he works 7 days a week, 12 to 16 hours a day holidays included. At night, he returned to Modena, that's a city lives in. He travels a few short miles away to where the Ferrari factory is. He felt extremely emotionally attached to his city, except for his daily drives to Maranello, he refused to leave Modena for almost any reason. He just had one focus in life. Now the difference between let's compare and contrast Ferrari's business model with Ford. Ford makes thousands of cars every few days. What does Ferrari do. Ferrari produces just a few cars each week. So who's going to pay for the ability to do that. Paying for it all was a rarefied group of clients who commissioned their cars as if there were pieces of art and paid Enzo Ferrari extraordinary amounts for them. So not only is Ferrari producing a very extreme product, but he also had -- he's a very extreme person. And I'll talk more about that, but here's an example, he was just really hard to figure out.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It says, "Ferrari was a riddle, a man who built racing cars but refuse to attend races." He used to be a racecar driver, actually, that's how get started. But I'll talk about -- I don't think I'd talk about that more in this book, but I definitely will next week. So he was a man who built raising cars who refused to attend races. "He worked tiredly seed to perfect state-of-the-art machines, but he feared elevators." He also refused to ever fly in a plane, too. Let me talk to you about his early life here. It says, "Ferrari could remember the day he was seduced by automobiles. He was 11 years old. The year was 1909. One day, he rose from bed and set out across the rail tracks adjacent to his home. He hiked the 2 miles alone. In the countryside, the Modena Automobile Association had organized a race. It was a group of drivers we were going to attempt to break the mile speed record. "Donkeys far outnumbered automobiles on Modena's streets in 1909. Motor cars were objects of curiosity and a chance to see how fast it could go lured a bustling crowd. Enzo took in the scene." So at a very young age, he falls in love with cars. A few years later, he's like, I know what I want to do. I want to be a racecar driver. "Unfortunately, World War I derailed Ferrari's ambitions, the war ravage Italy destroying its economy and infrastructure." Yet here's the positive or the negative. "And yet the war accelerated the innovation of automobiles and airplanes. The war left Ferrari penniless. His father and brother dead. He was relatively uneducated, having sat through 4 years of elementary school and 3 years of trade school," which he failed out of, by the way. "But he possess a valuable talent, a knack for fixing things. At age 23, he joined Alfa Romeo as a test driver, mechanic, and competitor. In 1929, Ferrari founded," these are Italian words, I'm going to mispronounce, "Scuderia Ferrari, a private team that served as Alfa Romeo's racing arm." Remember, at the beginning of the book, it talks about that these races were the greatest marketing tool that the industry ever saw. This is also not new.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

We saw this back in the early 1900s. Henry Ford got a lot of publicity by -- even though he didn't like racing, he entered Ford cars into racing. I think he even race and won himself because he understood the value of that attention. We also saw back in Founders #28 when I covered the Wright Brothers. People from all of the world, there'll be tens of thousands of people joining. They actually had a demonstration of Le Mans, too. I think it was Wilbur Wright. It might have been Orville. But all these people come, and they see these flying machines and of course, a certain percentage of those people at these races and these events are going to want to buy what's being demonstrated. Let's see, it said, so he founds a racing team. He won his last race in 1931. He's actually pretty good at it. Ferrari declared that he would never race again. He had a son and he devoted himself to creating a legacy that would live beyond him. So now I want to tell you about Ferrari's three principles for winning. What I would say about him is that I think he was a master at understanding human nature more than almost anything else. And so we're going to see that here. So he talks about all the stuff he learned, racing, and then now starting to build cars. He says, "During these years, the agitator of men, as he was nicknamed, studied the psychology of winning. Certain principles were self-evident, and this is the three he came with up with. Number one, competition is the impetus for innovation. The fiercer the competition, the faster the cars will go." This also played on how -- he has a rather, I would say, controversial management style. And one, I don't know if I'd emulate, but I'm going to tell you about it. He believed that competition brought the best out in people. And so what he would do is he would have multiple people in the company assigned to the same role and he put people in the company even though they're working for the same goal against each other because he wanted to make them compete because he thought the results of that competition would be better. He would also have like -- engage in like almost psychological warfare. So I don't think it would be very easy to work for him. "Number two, there is in some men a need to achieve greatness." This also applies to people too generally.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But he says, "When match with talent, this necessity can turn humans into demigods. And number three, a man who is willing to die at the wheel is always likely to beat a man in a faster car if he can survive until the end of the race." So there's also something I need to tell you about that I didn't know before I read the book in the '50s, '60s this specific part of racing, which is called Formula 1. Everybody dies essentially. He's got like -- Ferrari recruit, let's say, nine drivers. Two will wind up quitting for other reasons. The other seven within a few years will all be dead. Every time in the book, he introduce a new character like, oh, why am I -- who's this new character? Two paragraphs later, they're dead. I went and looked up because I was like, how is this even possible? A few people every year during the time period we're at in the book, a few drivers. They call them pilots, though. So a few pilots would die. Eventually, by the time you get to the '80s, they drastically made the safe sport or to now the sport is safer, sorry. I looked it up -- when you have Senna, which is one of the most famous last Formula 1 drivers to die. He died in '94. Since then, since 1994. I think there were about five drivers that died. There'd be five drivers that died a year in the '50s and '60s. No one would they die, but their cars would be -- they lose control of them and they go into the stands. And one time, they killed like 70. I want to say 70 people watching the race. This is a really insane time period, an insane story, but it attracts very extreme personalities to the point where Ferrari was saying, if you want to win, you have to be willing to die at the wheel. I don't want to die, not in that way. But this entire book is introducing us -- some of my notes I left is like everybody in this book is hardcore. They're very, very extreme. Okay. So now I want to talk to you a little bit about how Ferrari, the company started, racing is marketing, and then we're going to get into more of his personality and the philosophy he has to running businesses.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So one of the drivers, the former racecar drivers that survived for Ferrari is this guy named Chinetti, and he gives this idea to Ferrari about building cars for the masses, not for the masses, but not just for racing. So it says, "Chinetti was an American citizen now, and he described what he found in the new world." So he used to be living in Italy, lives in America now. He's coming back to Italy to tell Enzo all this stuff. "Roads were filled with big Detroit cars, but the sports car did not exist. There was no such thing. Chinetti had an idea, Ferrari should build cars and sell them in America. It took Ferrari nearly two years to build the first car. In post-war Europe, electricity was a luxury. Fuel and manpower were in short supply." So that's part of why I wanted to play that quote, that audio from Steve Jobs talking about if you're not passionate -- if Enzo did not -- he ran into so many barriers and obstructions and problems that if he wasn't completely committed and completely passionate, he would have given up. And as a result, we wouldn't have the creations that he made. "Fuel and manpower were in short supply. All we wanted to do was build a conventional engine, he later recalled." So he's saying, but here's the caveat he puts in there. So he want to build a conventional engine, only one that would be outstanding. So it's a completely high set of standards he has for himself and the products he's making. He says, "The first post-war Le Mans was won by Chinetti in a Ferrari." Now what happens, right? "The win triggered an instant demand for Ferrari's cars across the continent." Now he also -- this book doesn't talk about it, but his biography does that people that knew him well considered him a master at marketing. The author states that he invented a lot of marketing that was now used in the past. I don't know if that's true, I've read like two books on David Ogilvy by now.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I think a lot of the principles that Ferrari figured out, Ogilvy also figured out at a similar time. But he was definitely very gifted at it. So what he would do, let me give you an example of that is like even when there was -- many times, his company is suffering poor financial results, and so they'd have like an abundance of inventory, right? But they would hide the inventory because people would travel all over the world to the factory to meet Enzo to see the car, it was like an experience, right? It's not just going to a car dealership, which is kind of like a headache now. And people are like, Enzo, I love -- people travel from America, for example, I want to buy a car, I want to buy a car. And he's like, yes, okay, but you're going to have to wait several months. And he did that because he wanted Ferraris to be desired. And if somebody traveled and says, okay, here's pick out one of the six I haven't sold yet. They're not desiring. He wanted to -- and he knew by human nature, the more you wait for something, the harder it is to get. The more you pay for it, the more value you're going to get out of it. It's very interesting. So it says, "Ferrari funneled every lira or dollar into the racing campaign. Money was tight and the business model demanded that races be won. Why would a wealthy sportsman buy Ferrari if a Jaguar had proved the finer machine on the track? Nothing like a Ferrari had ever graced American roads. They were cars built by Italian artisans. Every detail down to the steering wheel handcrafted using some of the same method used to make Roman suits of armor and the royal carriages of the ancient kingdoms. Years later, Ferrari was asked, which of his cars was his favorite? He answered, 'The car, which I have not yet created.' And which of his victories meant the most, 'The ones which I have not yet achieved." So again, he's taken a completely different approach. At this time, Ford's factories -- he's got giant factories all over the world, highly automated. They'll churn out more Fords in 48 hours than Ferrari make all year. Enzo is not taking that. He's not interested in that. They're hand built. [0:24:26] They're made by artisans. They take an extreme amount of time, and they sell at 20x or 30x the price of like a base level Ford. And I think one of the important things to realize about that is if you're taking that route, you're making a handmade product essentially, you're not going to describe that product in boring terms because you're intimately associated with every detail of it. And so here's an example of Ferrari's level of dedication, and that's the main point of this podcast is like, even if you're not extremely passionate about the product you're making, maybe you're passionate about the problem you're solving or the company you're building. But it's the way to describe it to the outside world that I think is really essential. There's a lot of parts of Ferrari's personality I don't find attractive. But one thing I'm extremely attracted to is the way he would describe and talk about why he's doing what he's doing. So check this out, "When asked about the root of his mania." Think about the word too, mania, that's crazy. "When asked about the root of his mania, his obsession with victory, Ferrari told one reporter, 'Everything that I've done, I did because I couldn't do anything less. One day, I want to build a car that's faster than all of them, and then I want to die." And there's so many great quotes about him talking like this in the book. I frigging love it. Here's another one, "This kind of love, which I can describe in almost a sensual or sexual way within my subconscious, is probably the main reason why for so many years, I no longer went to see my cars race. To think about them, to see them born and to see them die because in a race, they are always dying even if they win, it is unbearable." Okay. So we're now at a part in the story where he's winning races, but he spends all of the money. So basically, he was attracted to racing first, then he realized, oh, I'm going to build cars as a way to fund my race team, right? And he becomes extremely passionate about the cars he's building because he's also racing them at the same time.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Now this is important because it's going to set up the entire like why this book is written. I haven't even got to like where is the Ford versus Ferrari in all this. But to understand why Ford, Henry Ford II has this vendetta of Enzo we have to understand what's happening with Enzo's company first. So it says, "Ferrari's company was struggling. He spent all of his profits on racing, and he was badly in need of money. He was being vilified at every turn." So what's happening is what I was telling you, all his drivers were dying. And it's not just Ferrari's, like all -- they all die. This is an insane time in human history that they're engaging this. It says, in the newspapers, he used to be called the magician of Maranello. That's the city that his cars are made in and now he's being called the monster of Maranello. One contact driver's wife called him an assassin. So he had another nickname picked up for his whole life is an assassin because so many of his drivers die. And his thoughts, he's like, had he not brought Italy another world championship? Had he not raised the reputation of Italian automobile into the stratosphere? So I mean, this is a kind of a hardcore person. He's like, well, these deaths are unfortunate, but they're necessary. And let's not focus on the individual death, let's focus on what it says -- he's extremely nationalistic, right? And a lot of these race war. At the time, they're like, no, the Italians won. Oh, the Germans won. It's very -- almost like a miniature -- like a war is playing out in the race field, right, or the racetrack. So he said, "The old man was livid and so he came up with a plan." And this is what I mean by he's very Machiavellian, he's like a great strategist. He's just -- and to serve his goal, I don't know if you want to be like this with individual -- like personal relationships. Probably not a good way to -- he almost essentially use people to get what he wanted. So again, I don't think that's something you want to do with people. You could probably be as successful by not doing that, but that's definitely something that we see over and over again. There are people that they're so focused on their goal that they're willing to do things that other people may not appreciate.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And Ferrari is definitely like -- we can't hide the negative parts of who he was. It's very apparent when you study him. So anyways, he comes up with this idea, right? And he's like, I'm going to sell my -- so he's getting -- I need to explain this to you a little bit better. He's getting vilified by his own people, right? But he's also saying, hey, I'm doing this for the pride of Italy. He loves his country. He loves his city. He loves his region. He says, okay, you want to vilify me? I'm going to sell the best Italian car company to the Americans. So I'm going to go here, and I'm going to negotiate with Ford. And let me give you the difference between Ford and Ferrari at the time. Henry Ford II at the same time he's doing negotiations with Ferrari. Ferrari he's like, I'll let you buy my company for $18 million, right? At the same time, the Ford organization is investing $800 million to open a new factory in Europe. So that gives you the difference of scale between the two businesses. Ford has tens of thousands and they have like 300,000 employees, something crazy like that. Ferrari has like 200. So this is how and why the Ford and Ferrari negotiations began. "If the market abroad was the future and racing victories translated into sales, the Ferrari factory could be a brilliant strategic acquisition. Iacocca got to go ahead to explore." So you might know this name, Lee Iacocca. It's funny how life works. But I read his biography like 18 years ago because at the time I was reading -- instead of reading books on founders, I was reading books on CEOs and stuff. So I read his book, Jamie Dimon's book, et cetera, et cetera. Well, at this point in history, Lee Iacocca he's a high paid executive in Ford. He hasn't yet had a falling out with Henry Ford II, which you will, which causes him to leave and go to Chrysler. And then he does maybe one of the greatest company turnarounds ever. So if you're interested in that, you can study his history. But he's the one saying, hey, we're going to try to go and buy Ferrari.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so now he sends over this other executive. His name is not important, but he's going to meet with Enzo Ferrari. He says, "Yes, Ferrari said, he was interested in striking a deal. He chose Ford because he was a great admirer of Henry I." That's actually true, but he does not like Henry II. He doesn't like Americans in general. "He would sell his factory to the Americans as long as he could retain control of the racing team. He had no interest in the customer cars," running that division that means. "I never felt myself to be an industrialist, but a constructor, Ferrari told the Ford man. The production development of my firm is only of interest to me if it is conducted by others. But be quite clear that in the construction and management in the racing cars, I want absolute autonomy." So he's setting up this deal, but he has a bunch of requests, right? And in hindsight, I think he's setting up the request, this is a ruse, I need to tell you that right up front. He's never going to sell it to Ford. He's just wasting their time. The asking price was $18 million. I already told you that. It says, "As negotiations moved about, the executive reported back to Henry Ford II. Never did it occur to the Ford man that the whole deal could be, in fact, an elaborate machination, a ruse that Enzo Ferrari may have had another agenda completely. By this time, news of the deal was public knowledge, making it headlines all over the world. It would be the most unusual merger in automotive history. The Italian press was up in arms. It was as if they were losing a national treasure, the Ferrari Automobile, to these arrogant westerners, this pleased Ferrari. It seemed that he was not the monster of Maranello after all, but a monument to Italy."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

See, what he was trying to do here? No Italian would ever underestimate his value again. So he's reading the document -- Ford prepared this document, here's our official offer. He says, "As Ferrari read the document, the Ford men saw him underlining certain passages in red ink. In the margin, he drew a large exclamation point. It was clear he was angry. But here, Ferrari said holding the document, it is written that if I want to spend more money for racing, I have to request authorization to do so from America. Is it also written that away in the official English text?" because he's reading in Italian. "Where is the freedom that I demanded right from the start to make programs, select men and decide on money? But they're like, but Mr. Ferrari, you're selling your firm to us, and you pretend still to dispose of it at your pleasure. Ferrari's face contorted, something uncoiled inside of him. 'My rights, my integrity, my very being as a manufacturer, as an entrepreneur cannot work under this enormous machine, this suffocating bureaucracy of the Ford Motor company,' he shouted." Okay. So why am I telling you this? Why is this important? One, to give you an insight into Ferrari's personality. He did this whole thing because it hurt him that he was being vilified by his own people, and he's actually really smart. Like, oh, now Ferrari is going to be American? No, no, it's ours. It's our national treasure. And the second thing is when Henry Ford II hears about this, he dedicates essentially unlimited resources to beating Ferrari because Ferrari is having a lot of financial success because they were winning a bunch of races, specifically, they're winning Le Mans I think like four or five years in a row, I forgot how many years in a row, but a lot. And so now Henry Ford is going to say, okay, well, he's going to spend $18 million to Ferrari's company. Now he spends like $40 million in a year, just developing race cars. So that's why at the beginning the book. They're like, well, the Americans thought they could win with the almighty dollar. It turns out they were correct. Now something that covers in the book that I'm not going to talk at all about because I want to focus on Enzo Ferrari the person, is Ford approaches the way a big company does, and they don't have any success for like two years. And then they have to hire this entrepreneur Carroll Shelby, who build, you may have heard, Shelby cars. Actually, he's so fascinating in this book, and he's such like a misfit and a troublemaker and like a smartass that I'm immediately attracted to learn more about him.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I ordered a book. He's eventually going to be at future founders episode, but I'm not going to cover him at all. He's actually -- Matt Damon is going to play Carroll Shelby in that new movie. And I'm going to go watch the movie next week before I record the second part of the series to see if maybe there's anything in there that I can bring back to you guys that's useful. So I'm just going to give you a basic plot of the book. We obviously know how it turns out. Ford is not successful. Eventually, he gets the right people in place. Shelby being integral to -- one of the people very important to that success. And eventually, they're going to dethrone Ferrari and Ferrari is going sell his company and FIAT. So that's the basic premise of the book. But I still want to focus on what we learned from Enzo from the book. So this is Enzo describing the process of building a product. And this goes back to what I feel is his main attribute and one that I want to emulate is the fact that anything you're working on, bring passion to it. Passion is universal. It doesn't matter what culture you're from, what country you're from, it's universally attractive to other humans. And I think you're going to be better off -- all of us will be better off if we're working about something we're extremely passionate about because you can't hide passion. And it's understandable even if you don't -- you know what's so funny about passion, you can hear from the way the annotation of a voice or gestures or body language, you can see it even if you don't know what they're saying. All right. So it says, he once described the process of building such a car. Now this is Ferrari, "In the first act of his labor, the maker can sees what his creature is to be." Think about that. He calls himself a maker and he talks about what he's making a creature, a living thing. Goes back to that, "He dreams of it, and he sees it in detail, and he lays down the plan of work which he entrusted to a band of helpers who share his passion. A racing car, in fact, does not necessarily come into being as the creation of a superior mind, but is always the compendium of the common unflagging and enthralling work of a team fired by a common enthusiasm, there follows its construction, which must nearly always be done in record time, although it never takes less than six to eight months of feverish work.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"The next stage is the assembly of the car and its testing, which is the most delicate, the most engrossing and the most dramatic phase." So halfway through that paragraph, you forget that he's talking about a car. He has to bring it back around in the last sentence or two that he's actually talking about a car. And what's also interesting to me, the more I learn about him is that he only opens up about his creation, about the product that he's making, the company he is making. So here's more about his personality. "A confidant once described the old man's temperament as closed like a walnut. Ferrari had created a Shakespearean world where intrigue was always brewing and men sometimes paid for mistakes with their lives." It talks about he would hide, he would always wear glasses. He essentially would not let people inside. He wanted to collect information, not give information, right? So this is -- he wrote his memoirs, so this is a quote from his memoirs. He says, "The facial expression, a smile or a frown or whatever it might be, is merely a form of defense and should be taken only as such." You're a very sneaky little dude, man. Now there is one thing in the book that has nothing to do -- well, it has something to do with Ferrari, but it's not Ferrari specifically. So if you're going back to the movie, Christian Bale in the movie is going to play this guy named Les miles, (sic) [ Ken Miles ]. Ken Miles is Carroll Shelby's right-hand man. So let me give you some background. Ford was having a lot of -- not having any success trying to beat Ferrari for several years. They were running everything by committee. Even though all of this is happening in Europe, all the decisions would have to be approved back at Ford's headquarters in Michigan. It was just like a -- it was terrible. It is a typical big company way of doing things. And so this part, what I'm about to read to you is Ken Miles, which is the character Christian Bale plays about what changed and why the fact that Ford eventually handle -- gives Shelby saying, hey, you're now in charge, you make all decisions. And Shelby is not in Detroit. He has a tiny little company in Venice, California, with a band of misfits. Ken Miles is definitely one of these misfits. Carroll Shelby, if you hear him talk, he's definitely a misfit. So the reason I bring this up is because this is the advantage that founder-led companies have over a larger company that has a committee structure. It's just not led by this person that created anymore.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

What Ken Miles is telling us, right? He's telling us that he can finally do -- well, let me read it you first, okay? So he says, "We have several advantages over other people who have played with the car," meaning the car they're trying to be Ferrari with, Miles told a reporter. "We can react to a suggestion. We can do something right now. We don't have to go through elaborate procedures of putting through formal design changes. If we decide we don't like something, we can take a hacksaw and cut it off. Practically everything we do is a panic operation, but if anyone can do it, we can." So what essentially Ken Miles, we're going to call them Christian Bale is telling us is that they, the people competing with Ferrari, can finally do what Ferrari could do the whole time. Ferrari didn't -- he was a dictator of his company. He didn't have to ask for permission. He made a decision and it happened right away as opposed to the Ford racing team is just like, oh, we got to get it clear to three levels of management. There's got to be a meeting. They described some of the meetings these people have. It's hilarious to me. It's like, no, we can't make a decision, we've got to get 25 people. Okay, we'll meet two Thursdays from now at this hotel and there will be 25 people meeting for six hours and then we'll make a decision. I was like, that's absurd. And the reason I bring this up is because, one, it's obviously an advantage that we see over and over and over again in these biographies. Founder-led companies just don't have to deal with this. It's very clear who the final decision rest with. It also reminds me of a scene that happened several times in that book. I did a podcast on the book called the Creative Selection. And it was one of the designers -- one of the programmers working at Apple, when they were designing the -- he worked on the keyboard for the original iPhone and then also the iPad. And he would describe how decisions were made in Apple when Steve Jobs was alive, and it's completely opposite of what one might expect.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Your responsibility was to demo. Steve would want to see what you're working, he's want to touch it and see it working. And then in a few minutes, he's make a decision, so like making a decision on the keyboard of the most important product ever made. It happened in like a matter --, I think maybe it was like two or three demos. I can't remember exactly how much. But you're talking about a few handful of minutes, five minutes, 10 minutes, maybe 15 minutes, and that's it because Steve knew exactly what he wanted. And when he saw it in real life, he like's, okay, that's what we're going. And that's it. There was no, oh, let me go talk to Board of Directors, let me go to talk to this person. It's done. And so this change that Ford made is a reason why they were eventually -- they wind up beating Ferrari. Once they beat them once, they beat them several years in a row and then Honda and other countries started coming in and winning. But I think that's extremely important. All right. So more about Ferrari. This is Ferrari who was asked on if he has a social life. "No, none. Life passes soon enough. If you want to do one thing well, you have to work at it fast. A Ferrari may not be a masterpiece in exactly the same way that a great work of painting or sculpture is, but it represents the work of many men bringing to life the ideas of Ferrari." Again, one, we see two things there. One, he has complete dedication to this. He doesn't really think about anything else. And two, he, again, describing his products, he's like, oh, it may not be a masterpiece of like a painting or sculpture, but he's putting that into your mind as he talks. Okay. Now I think of a painting, or a great sculpture and now I think of Ferrari too. The way he describes his products is amazing. So I want to tell you about this random quote because it's been on my mind lately too. There's a quote -- a rider is interviewing a famous bullfighter, right? Bullfighter is very similar to racecar pilots at the time. You'd be seriously injured if you're not -- you have a dangerous occupation. And so he's interviewing this bullfighter he says something to him.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The writer says, "You're the most completely egotistical bastard I've ever met." His response is what I want to tell you that I find interesting. He says, "You don't understand. When I go in there, if I don't really and truly believe I'm the best in the world, I'd better not go in at all." So on a lot of the notes that I've been taking I've been trying to find the parallels for entrepreneurs that you see in other domains, whether it's scientists, but especially like athletes, magicians, other artists, craftsman like this. This is something that is hard to talk about, but I think the people that feel they are the best in the world are what they're doing, let's use the example I've used many times in this podcast so far. I'm pretty sure Steve Jobs thought he was the best in the world at making devices, making computers. I'm positive that he thought he was the best in the world at it. I think there's something -- like it's not sure -- if you talk to athletes about this, they're going to tell you that you don't become the best in the world and then think you're the best in the world. That's not the order it happens. The order it happens is I think I can be the best in the world at it and I'm going to work really hard at it and then I'm going to. It's the reverse order that most people think. Most people think, oh, you had the success, now you can strut a little bit or maybe talk about like -- the fact that you worked really hard now you're the best in the world. They're saying, no, no, no. You need to have that belief going in. And I think Steve Jobs had that belief. I think Enzo Ferrari definitely believed he was building the best cars in the world. And my point here is even if there's no reason for you to believe that yet is probably beneficial for your belief in your potential to get there, whatever it is. And now in business, it's a lot different than a sport -- than like a car race or a basketball game, for example, because those are zero-sum events, there's one champion every year and 50 or 100 losers or however many people racing. In basketball, 29 other losers whatever the case is.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This is reason I think entrepreneurs take this because there's no -- it's all positive for some. I mean there are obviously some industries where there's one or two winners, whatever the case is, winner take all. But the vast majority, we can carve out these little, tiny niches, where we can be the best. And you can have that belief and then you could find a customer base that also believes that. And if you have that belief and then you have customers that also agree with your belief, then you have a successful business, whatever the size that may be. So I don't know the best way to describe this. I just think that this is something I see over and over again, and there's something there in our psyche that I think is beneficial if you can harness that. And I've talked about this before where I feel like why are we at a -- in the United States, we're at a 40-year low to new business creation. Entrepreneurship is at a 40-year low. One thing before you can have a successful company, you have to believe that you can have a successful company. I think most people think it's way too difficult. And something that, if you listen to this podcast enough, read between the lines is anybody can learn this. It's not like you have to go to school and get a certificate or a license to be an entrepreneur. You got people like Enzo Ferrari. He failed out of everything. He's got like essentially an elementary school education and created one of the most valuable companies and valuable products ever. You don't have to be good at life. You just need to be good at one specific thing and do it really, really well. Go a couple of weeks ago and I was thinking about Jim Clayton the other day. Jim Clayton had an amazing life, sold his business for almost $2 billion to Warren Buffet. What did he get really good at? He got really good at building a mobile home company. And guess what, if you get really good at anything like that, then you can have -- you'll build wealth beyond that you could spend on a lifetime, and you'll have a really interesting life. But there's no school you could go to, like, hey, teach me how to build the most valuable mobile home manufacturer in the world, but life can teach you that. And I don't know, I think that's why I think entrepreneurship was one of the most interesting things in the world in general because I'm always constantly surprised all these unique ways people find products they make and ways to support their family and in the fact that it's wide open and available to everybody.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Not everybody can be a doctor. You got to go through a certain track to do so. Not everybody can be a million different occupations. But literally, anybody could be an entrepreneur. So I don't know, I think tied to the fact that anybody can do it is people have to believe they have the ability to do it. And I don't know how to solve that problem other than showing you example after example after example of people that come from almost nothing. Think about Jim Clayton, he didn't have a bathroom, didn't have electricity. They could take a bath -- there's 4 people in his family, they can take a bath once a week using the same water. That person, that guy had no advantages in life. And yet he was ultimately resourceful and built it up over time to build -- he built multiple valuable business actually. He built a really profitable car dealership. He build Clayton Homes, he wind up building a global banking empire. So I don't know, man, I'm sure there's somebody listening to this that doesn't think they could do it, you can. If you really think about it and you won't give up and you find something you're passionate about, you absolutely can. Okay. We're almost to the end of what I want to talk about in the book. You know the general plot of the book. And obviously, the book is -- it's a really interesting and fun read. But I want to pull out just a few more things here to share with you. So one thing is I realize is Ferrari's out here playing chess and everybody he's going against is playing checkers. And we're going to get to the point on right before -- he's been beating -- Ford has declared war on him for a few years, but is unsuccessful. But Ford is progressing every year and Ferrari knows he's about to lose. And so what Ferrari does here is what I mean by he's out here playing chess and everybody is playing checkers.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he said, "Both he, Enzo, and Henry II lived and breathed their companies. Ferrari has no other satisfaction. His family, his very life is that creature of his La Ferrari." That's one of his -- the people this guy named Jano, who was one of his best engineers that worked for a long time, describing Ferrari. He said, "Ferrari had acute talent for using public opinion to his advantage. He was a master of manipulation and subterfuge." Remember, I was referencing this earlier. "And in this new era of mass media, he would put his skills to work. He published an article in the Italian magazine accepting defeat before the race began, knowing that this bit of gossip would get picked up by the international newspapers." Now this is what Ferrari wrote, "We know that nothing is being done to resist the steamroller of the Americans." Remember, he's writing this in an Italian magazine. That's important to understand. "To resist the steamroller of the Americans who will find the road open to success in sports car racing. We fought on the track with autos and at the table against the abuses of power and the regulations. Even while continually winning races, I understood that we are gradually losing them. We intensified our activity to the utmost, but we managed simply to slow down the approach of the steamroller. The battle was lost in advance." So what's happening here? It says, "Ferrari, who was willingly casting himself as an underdog, Ford was Goliath, and he was David. If he lost, well, he had predicted defeat. Henry II had done nothing but buy Le Mans with his countless millions. And if Ferrari won, as he absolutely intended to, well, in a lifetime destined by tragedy and victory, perhaps he would achieve his greatest moments." So that's the year in 1966 Ferrari does indeed lose, but he doesn't come out of it that much worse for wear. Ford winds up winning, their business in Europe grows even at a time in America, it's slowly declining at this point. But Ferrari sells 50% of his business to an Italian company, which he would never sold it to anybody else, he sells it to FIAT.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then when he dies, that ownership goes up to 90%. The other 10% goes up to his one surviving son, because he had one son who died and he had another son from a mistress, and that's son still -- I think still to this day owns 10% of Ferrari. But in the end, Ferrari get what he wants, he has the financial stability of a larger company, still able to make decisions in racing and has a safe home for his passion and his creation. He still runs the company until he dies. All right. So that's the end of the story about Ford and Ferrari. I want to talk about one more thing before I wrap up the story. And this is what I said earlier when I left a note that everybody in this book is hardcore. And it's just an amazing quote by this guy named Bruce McLaren. So Bruce McLaren, he plays a role -- he winds up being a racecar driver for Ford. He eventually starts his own racing team, and he founds McLaren Automotive. And he does all of this before 32 years old when he dies. And he dies racing because that was passion in life. I just want to read this quote to you. It said, "McLaren might have known he would someday die at the wheel. He had just published an autobiography in which he had written his own epitaph." So think about the thought process there. Who's going to write an autobiography when they're 28 or 30 years old. And now this is a quote from McLaren, "To do something well is so worthwhile that to die trying to do it better cannot be foolhardy. It would be a waste of life to do nothing with one's ability for I feel that life is measured in achievement not in years alone." So I just want to encourage you to, obviously, not to die from whatever you're doing. That's way too extreme. But I like that thought that he says, trying to do better, especially it would be a waste of life to do nothing with one's abilities. And I think in the domain of entrepreneurship, everybody has some way they can contribute. Some large, some small. But the idea of creating something and then over time, making it better, I think that's a worthy way to spend your life.

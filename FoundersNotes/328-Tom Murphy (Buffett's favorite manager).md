"Warren Buffett said, ‘Tom Murphy and Dan Burke were probably the greatest two-person combination in management that the world has ever seen or maybe ever will see.’ When he speaks to business school classes, Warren Buffett often compares the rivalry between Tom Murphy's company, Capital Cities Broadcasting and CBS to a transatlantic race between a rowboat and the QE2." QE2 is the Queen Elizabeth 2, it is this giant transatlantic liner, much, much larger than the Titanic. So he compares it to a transatlantic race between a rowboat and the QE2 to illustrate the tremendous effect management can have on long-term returns. "When Murphy became the CEO of Capital Cities in 1966, CBS was the dominant media business in the country with TV and radio stations in the country's largest markets, the top-rated broadcast network and valuable publishing and music properties. "In contrast, at that time, Capital Cities had five TV stations and four radio stations, all in small markets. CBS' market capitalization was 16 times the size of capital cities. But by the time Murphy sold his company to Disney 30 years later, Capital Cities was three times as valuable as CBS. In other words, the rowboat had won decisively."

That is an excerpt from the book I'm going to talk about today, which is The Outsiders, 8 unconventional CEOs and their radically rational blueprint for success. It was written by William Thorndike. And specifically, I'm going to focus on Chapter 1, which is about Tom Murphy and Capital Cities Broadcasting and the name of the chapter is A Perpetual Motion Machine for Returns. And before I do that, I'm going to actually put this book down for one second.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I'm going to pick up last week's book, which was Ted Turner's Autobiography, and read this section because he appears -- Tom Murphy and his partner, Dan Burke appear in Ted Turner’s autobiography as well because they also built -- they actually build Capital Cities from a small broadcasting company into a multibillion-dollar media conglomerate. And so this is what Ted Turner said about them. “I like the Capital Cities’ people a lot. Dan Burke and Tom Murphy really understood the business. They had built their company up by buying TV and radio stations as well as newspapers and magazines and operating them efficiently.” That is not the first time I read Tom Murphy's name in one of the books that I have covered for the podcast. All the way back on Episode 286, I did an episode on Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger talk about Tom Murphy over and over again. They mentioned him in the shareholder letters, they mentioned him when they're answering the Q&As at their annual meeting. But this is what they said in the book, “All I want to know is when I'm going to die, so I'll never go there,” that I covered back on Episode 286. This is Warren Buffett. He says, “40 years ago, Tom Murphy gave me one of the best pieces of advice I've ever received. He said, Warren, you can always tell someone to go to hell tomorrow. You haven't missed that opportunity. Just forget about it for a day. If you feel the same way tomorrow, then tell them that then, but don't spout off in a moment of anger.” And just one more excerpt before we jump into the book, and this actually comes from the book called A Few Lessons from Warren Buffett. I covered it all the way back on Episode 202. This is advice that Tom Murphy gave Warren Buffett on cost control. Cost control is something you and I are going to talk about a lot today. It's central to understanding Tom Murphy's incredible performance. This is what Warren Buffett says, “30 years ago, Tom Murphy drove this point home to me with a hypothetical tale about an employee who asked his boss for permission to hire an assistant. The employee assumed that adding $20,000 to the annual payroll would be inconsequential. But his boss told him that the proposal should be evaluated as a $3 million decision, given that an additional person would probably cost at least that amount over their lifetime, factoring in raises, benefits, and other expenses,” down to the fact that the company would have to buy more toilet paper.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This is how insane this guy paid attention to cost and efficiency. “And unless the company fell on very hard times, the employee added would be unlikely to be dismissed, however marginal his contribution to the business.” So as we go through this overview of Tom Murphy's life and his business philosophy, just remember that, he watched headcount like a hawk. So let's go back to the book, the chapter on Tom Murphy in The Outsiders. And it's going to pick up where we just left off where Capital Cities winds up vastly outperforming over the three decades, CBS and like, okay, well, how does this happen? “How did this seemingly insurmountable gap between these two companies get closed?” So it says, “The answer lies in fundamentally different management approaches. CBS spent much of the 1960s and 1970s, taking the enormous cash flows generated by its network and broadcast operations and funding an aggressive acquisition program that led it into entirely new fields.” So instead of focusing on other media properties and media business that they knew well, they bought things like a toy business, and they even bought the New York Yankees. They also would issue stock to fund some of these acquisitions. They're going to compare and contrast, obviously, the way CBS is being led under this guy named Bill Paley, who's actually the founder of CBS. I was reading about Bill Paley last week in the Ted Turner Autobiography, and he mentioned Will. So he actually went out and bought -- and it's actually sitting at my desk right now. It's Bill's Autobiography, which was published all the way back in 1979. So eventually, I'm going to read it and if it's good, I'll make a podcast on it. But let's go back to this. So they're getting into new fields that they don't know enough about. They're issuing shares. They're building a fancy headquarters in Midtown Manhattan at an enormous expense. And then they developed -- now this is going to be maybe the largest contrast between CBS and Capital Cities.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“They developed a corporate structure,” listen to this, “with 42 presidents and vice presidents, and generally displayed what Charlie Munger calls ‘a prosperity-blinded indifference to unnecessary costs.’” When I got to the section of the book, it made me think of one of my favorite things that Munger says, they go and -- I think it was during the Buffalo Evening News after they bought it. And he was really against -- Munger was really against spending money on luxurious offices, and so he has his great quip. He's like, “Why does a newspaper need a palace to publish in?” And so that's what I think of when they're describing what's going on here. Murphy's Strategy “The strategy at CBS was consistent with the conventional wisdom of the conglomerate era, which espoused the elusive benefits of ‘diversification’ to justify the acquisition of unrelated businesses. At its core, CBS' strategy,” and implemented by Bill Paley, “was focused on making CBS larger.” So now they start contrasting that with Murphy's strategy for Capital Cities. “In contrast, Murphy's goal was to make his company more valuable,” not just larger, but more valuable. “As he said to me,” and so Thorndike is talking to him for this book, right? “As he said to me, ‘The goal is to not have the longest train, but to arrive at the station first using the least fuel.’” Murphy has got a bunch of good lines when he's talking to Thorndike. That's one of my favorites. “The goal is to not have the longest train, but to arrive at the station first using the least fuel.” And so as he continues to describe the difference in Murphy and Burke’s strategy compared to CBS, I just jotted down a few notes on what was happening on this page for my own self. I just penned, “Find your edge, don't diversify, and never repeat what works.” “Murphy and Burke rejected diversification and instead created an unusually streamlined conglomerate that focused laser-like on the media business that it knew well. Murphy acquired more radio and TV stations,” as opposed to buying the Yankees or toy company, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he acquires more radio and TV stations, “Operated them superbly well, and regularly repurchased his shares. The formula that allowed Murphy to overtake Paley was deceptively simple: number one, focus on industries with attractive economic characteristics; number two, selectively use leverage to buy occasional large properties; number three, improve operations; number four, pay down debt; and number five, repeat this loop.” More contrasting by Thorndike. What's interesting is that his peers at other media companies did not follow this path. They followed fashion and diversified into unrelated businesses, I'm going to pause in the middle of that sentence actually because when I got to that section, it made me think of something I read in Warren's Berkshire shareholder letters, where he says, "The behavior of peer companies will be mindlessly imitated." It's exactly what's happening in the book, right? They're just following fashion, what's really popular to do at the time, whatever other people -- what other company, other conglomerates are doing, they're going to diversify into unrelated businesses. They're going to build large corporate staffs and they're going to overpay for marquee media properties. Obviously, he's setting that up for you and I to tell us that Murphy did the opposite. He did none of those things. “Capital Cities under Murphy was an extremely successful example of what we would now call a roll-up. In a typical roll-up, a company acquires a series of businesses, attempts to improve operations, and then keeps acquiring, benefiting over time from scale advantages and best management practices.” Now just because it sounds simple, it does not mean it's easy. There's a lot of people, especially in the 90s and the 2000s that tried to do this. And a lot of these companies that tried to do a bunch of roll-ups wind up going out of business, and he talks a little bit about why this happened to them and why it did not happen to Tom Murphy. “A lot of these companies collapsed under the burden of too much debt. These companies typically failed because they acquired too rapidly and underestimated the difficulty of integrating acquisitions and improving operations. Murphy's approach to the roll-up was different.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“He moved slowly. He developed real operational expertise,” which I think is one of the benefits of not diversifying, right? By the time he does his biggest acquisition, he’s going to come three decades into his career. He's going to buy ABC with Warren Buffett’s help. He can have real conviction. Do I actually have operational expertise in operating all these media properties? Well, let me look at the past 30 years. Did I do this correctly or not? “And then he focused on a small number of large acquisitions that he knew to be high-probability bets. Capital Cities combined excellence in both operations and capital allocation to an unusual degree.” That goes back to the start of the chapter where Buffet's saying like Murphy and Burke are probably the greatest two-person combination ever. And it's this division of labor, the fact that Burke was the incredible operator, the one that rooted out all the inefficiencies and then Murphy was the one that was capital allocator, focused on strategy and acquisitions, which we'll get to. And again, here's another great Murphyism, if you will. So he says, “Capital Cities combined excellence in both operations and capital allocation to an unusual degree. As Murphy told me,” this is great. This is excellent. “The business of business is a lot of little decisions every day mixed up with a very few big decisions.” Okay. So let's go back in the time line and figure out how did Tom Murphy even get associated with Capital Cities to begin with. And really, the reason I'm highlighting this is because it speaks to the fact that one of the things you have to admire about Tom Murphy is that once he had conviction, he had no hesitancy about being bold and you see that with the decision to take this job in the first place. So he graduates from Harvard Business School, and he gets a job, just a normal job. He's working for Lever Brothers, which is this massive consumer packaged goods company at the time. He goes to this event at his parents' house, and he meets this guy named Frank Smith. And Smith begins to tell him about Smith’s latest venture, which is he bought a struggling TV station. This is before cable. Just like if you listen to last week, this is the early days of cable. This is very similar to the early days of Ted Turner's career. That's why I think it's so interesting to do this podcast right after the last one.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So Smith buys this, he buys a struggling TV station, and he purchased it out of bankruptcy. And before the evening was over, Murphy had agreed to leave his job in New York City and relocate to Albany to run the TV station. Now here's a crazy thing. He had no broadcast experience, nor did he have any kind of management experience of any kind. At this point, Tom Murphy is 29 years old. Tom is going to turn around this station. It’s going to take him three years. So the station has a bunch of operating losses, obviously, because it was bought out of bankruptcy, right? So he was turning it into, “A consistent cash generator by improving programming and then aggressively managing costs.” That's going to come up over and over and over again, “aggressively managing costs,” as you can imagine, when he's giving advice to Warren Buffett. By the way, Warren Buffett says that Tom Murphy was one of his heroes, that Tom Murphy made him a better person and that actually, that is the ultimate gift you can give to somebody by helping them become a better person. So you could imagine if he's giving Warren Buffett an advice saying that don't think about hiring another person just as like a $20,000 thing, like think about all like -- how much you're going to pay him over a decade. All the other stuff that comes with employee down to the amount of toilet paper that person’s going to use in the office, I think that that's an understatement, aggressively managing costs, right? So it says, “This is a formula that the company would apply repeatedly in the years ahead. In 1957,” so this is now three years later, “Smith and Murphy buy a second TV station. Then shortly thereafter, they buy a third TV station and then they change the name of the company to Capital Cities.” Hiring Dan Burke Now the third TV station is important because this is when Murphy hires a young 30-year-old with also no broadcast experience as his replacement to run the Albany station. That is Dan Burke. Dan Burke and Tom Murphy are going to be this dynamic duo as partners for the next 30 years.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So Murphy spends time training Burke, and he says, “He quickly indoctrinated Burke into the company's lean, decentralized operating philosophy. Then Murphy moves back to New York to work with Smith to build the company through acquisition.” So that is how Capital Cities is going to grow. It grows by “selectively acquiring additional radio and television stations.” Now here's what happens. Smith unexpectedly dies in 1966. By this time, Smith and Murphy had been working together for 11 years. So that means at 40 years old, after Smith's death, Murphy becomes CEO, and that's the position he's going to hold until he sells it to Disney. So at the time he takes over the company, they have revenue of just $28 million. Murphy's first move as CEO, he's like, okay, I'm going to elevate Burke to the role of President and Chief Operating Officer. And this was an excellent selection of a partner because they have essentially opposite skill sets, and they have a very clear division of labor. And so this is a description of their excellent partnership and who did what. “Burke was responsible for daily management of operations, and Murphy for acquisitions and capital allocation. As Burke told me, ‘Our relationship was built on a foundation of mutual respect. I had an appetite for and a willingness to do things that Murphy was not interested in doing.’ Burke believed his job was to create the free cash flow and Murphy's job was to spend it.” So by this time, Capital Cities owns five different TV stations, that was the maximum allowed by the FCC. So there's a regulation on the books at the time. You cannot own more than five. So like, okay, we're not going to stop growing. What are we going to do? It says, “They next turned their attention to newspaper publishing, which, as an advertising-driven business with attractive margins and strong competitive barriers, had close similarities to the broadcasting business.” So that's another example of him deviating from what other people building conglomerate were doing. This time he said, well, I just want to stick to these businesses that are very similar to each other that I know very well. And so after buying a bunch of newspapers, he's like, “Well, what other businesses are very similar to the ones I already own?”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Eventually, this regulation is going to be lifted. But before that happens, he’s like, “Well, there's this new invention,” which we talked about last week, “which is cable television. Okay. Well, that looks very similar to the broadcast TV stations I own, and then some of these newspapers that I own, they’re advertising-driven businesses with attractive margins. Let me go ahead and buy a cable television business.” And this was one of the most fascinating things about the Ted Turner Autobiography is the fact that Ted Turner was one of the first people in the broadcast TV industry to actually embrace cable, there's a maxim here that this is not a threat. It's an opportunity. Every other broadcaster besides Ted Turner and now we see Tom Murphy as well, thought about cable as, "Oh my god, this is a threat to my broadcast business." They both, Turner and Murphy's thought, it’s like, no, it's not a threat. It's an actual opportunity. And they also understood it is a better product offering. Like the genie's out of the bottle, like there's nothing you're going to do, like you might as well go with the technology that enables you to just reach a much larger market than somebody watching like a local or a regional TV station. And then it goes into another strategy that he used that was quite different. “During the extended bear market of the mid-1970s to early 1980s, Murphy became an aggressive purchaser of his own shares. He eventually bought close -- bought back close to 50% of his outstanding shares, most of it at single-digit price-to-earnings multiples. In 1984, the FCC relaxed its station ownership rules, and Murphy, in his masterstroke, bought the ABC Network.” So the note I left myself here is this is something that comes up over and over again in these books, “Stay in the game long enough to get lucky.” This is the most important thing that he does in his entire business career, and it happens 30 years into his career. So he buys ABC Network for nearly $3.5 billion with financing from his friend, Warren Buffett.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“The ABC deal was the largest non-oil and gas transaction in business history to that point and an enormous bet,” this is what I meant about him being able to be bold when he has a real convention, “and an enormous bet-the-company transaction for Murphy, representing over 100% of Capital Cities’ enterprise value at the time.” So the Wall Street Journal reported on this transaction with the headline, “The Minnow Swallows The Whale.” And then Murphy's partner Burke said at the time that this is the acquisition that I’ve been training for my entire life. So why would Murphy bet the entire company on one transaction? It says, “Murphy's conviction was that he could improve the margins of ABC's TV stations from the low-30s up to Capital Cities’ industry-leading levels of margins of 50-plus percent.” Oh, my god, check this out. “Under Burke’s oversight, the staff that oversaw ABC's TV station group dropped from 60 to 8 people. The margin gap was closed in just two years.” So in two years, they brought ABC's margins from 30% to over 50%. “A story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between the network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers. ABC was a limousine culture. Executives had the habit of taking a limo for even a few blocks to go to lunch. Murphy, however, was a cab man. Before long, this practice,” Murphy's practice of taking cabs everywhere instead of a limo -- for God’s sakes, you should walk a few blocks. Come on, stop being lazy. “Before long, this practice of taking cabs rippled through the ABC executive ranks. When asked whether this was a case of leading by example, Murphy responded, ‘Is there any other way?’ Capital Cities never made another large-scale acquisition after the ABC deal, focusing instead on integration, smaller acquisitions, and continued stock repurchasing.” “In 1995,” so 10 years after he bought ABC, “Buffet suggested to Murphy that he sit down with Michael Eisner,” who was the CEO of Disney at the time, they wind up meeting at the Allen & Company gathering in Sun Valley, Idaho.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And Eisner expressed an interest in buying the company. They wind up having a negotiation and Murphy negotiated a buyout price of $19 billion. He left -- Murphy then retired from active management. “He left behind an ecstatic group of shareholders.” Why are they ecstatic? Well, “If you had invested $1 with Tom Murphy as he became CEO in 1966, that dollar would have been worth $204 by the time he sold the company to Disney.” Okay. And so then the book goes into a little bit more about how they ran the business before the acquisition by Disney. It says, “One of the major themes in this book is resource allocation.” Operating Philosophy “The outsider CEOs,” so not just Tom Murphy, but the eight other CEOs -- so the 8 total CEOs covered in this book, including Henry Singleton, John Malone, Warren Buffett, says, “The outsider CEOs shared an unconventional approach, one that emphasized flat organizations and dehydrated corporate staffs.” There's a lot of very memorable language in the book. That is one of them, “dehydrated corporate staffs.” They also talked about headquarter staffs being anorexic. Both of those descriptions being important because that's how they want to build the company's culture. So the company's culture at Capital Cities meant “extraordinary autonomy for operating managers,” and this principle was stated in a single paragraph on the inside cover of every Capital Cities annual report.” And it says, “Decentralization is the cornerstone of our philosophy. Our goal is to hire the best people we can and give them the responsibility and authority they need to perform their jobs. We expect our managers to be forever cost conscious,” that phrase is repeated a few times, “forever cost conscious and to recognize and exploit sales potential. “Headquarters staff was anorexic. No vice presidents in functional areas like marketing, strategic planning, or human resources. No corporate counsel and no public relations department either. In the Capital Cities culture, the publishers and station managers had the power and the prestige internally, and they almost never heard from New York if they were hitting their numbers.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“The company's guiding human resource philosophy was repeated over and over again by Murphy, and it was, ‘Hire the best people you can and leave them alone. Extreme decentralized approach keeps both cost and rancor down.’” And I love how they make the point that Capital Cities ate their own cooking. “The guinea pig in the development of this philosophy was Dan Burke himself. In 1961, after he took over as General Manager at WTEN,” which was the station in Albany that first Murphy was managing, right? So after he takes over from Murphy, Burke -- this is hilarious. I love this part. “Burke began sending weekly memos to Murphy as he had been trained to do when he worked at General Foods. After several months of receiving no response, he stopped sending them, realizing his time was better spent on local operations than on reporting to headquarters. As Burke said, ‘Murphy delegates to the point of anarchy.’” Again, great memorable language in here. “Murphy delegates to the point of Anarchy. Frugality was also central to the Ethos.” This is going to sound a lot -- I mean, again, the two main, I think, ideas you see over and over again in the history of entrepreneurship is, one, the importance of focus; and two, “Gentlemen, watch your cost.” That is a quote from Andrew Carnegie. All of the people that we studied on the podcast with very few exceptions were maniacal about watching their costs. And Murphy and Burke described why they were also fanatical about this, and it is exactly like the frame of mind that Andrew Carnegie and his partner Henry Clay Frick had 150 years before this. So this is exactly what they said. So it says, “Murphy and Burke realized early on that while you couldn't control your revenues, you can control your costs. They believed that the best defense against the revenue lumpiness inherent in advertising-supported businesses was a constant vigilance on costs, which became deeply embedded in the company culture.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

That is Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick, that is Rockefeller, that is Ford, that is Sam Walton. In fact, it was hilarious. I'll bring up Walton in a minute because the next story that illustrates how obsessed they were about cost control reminded me of something that I read in Sam Walton’s Autobiography. “One of the earliest and most often told corporate legends, Murphy even scrutinized the company's expenditures on paint.” They wanted to repaint one of their TV stations. And Murphy says, “Paint the two sides that face the road and leave the other sides untouched.” He is forever cost conscious. There is a great story, anecdote told in Sam Walton's Autobiography. He's flying the plane, that little Cessna, that he would go around picking out like the new Walmart stores, and they're trying to come up with a name for the concept behind Walmart. And there's a series of names. Walmart is one of the ones suggested and one of the reasons -- first Sam was inspired by Sol Price, who I've covered over and over again about Fed-Mart. And so he liked the idea of Walmart, but one of the reasons he picked it is because it had less letters than the other options and therefore, less lighting, you knew you had to light up your stores, right? And so the less letters, less lighting, less cost on a grand scale. As he expands, might be only 7 letters instead of 11 or whatever the other options were, but that additional four letters, you don't have to make them, you don't have to light them, you don't have to clean them, all the additional expenses that would compound over time. So again, they all think this way, they are forever cost conscious, they're just insane about getting this competitive advantage that comes when you just watch your cost like a hawk. This is where he goes into headcount over and over again. So Phil Meek is one of the guys, he runs their publishing division. He works for both Burke and Murphy, right? “Phil Meek took this message to heart and ran the entire publishing operation.” So at this time, they had six daily newspapers, several magazines, and a bunch of weekly like shoppers, these things you see in like grocery stores, and he ran his headquarters with only three people.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

They would have very few meetings. One of the meetings is that people would come to New York, and they’d go over all of their -- again, they're obsessed with economic efficiency and how it relates to every single other idea that they have in their philosophy. And so what they do is they sit down, and they go through line by line, everything that you're spending. And so it says, “Particular attention was paid to capital expenditures and expenses. Managers were expected to outperform their peers, and great attention was paid to margins.” The profit margin that your company operated at was viewed as a form of report card to HQ. “Outside of these meetings, managers were left alone. The company did not simply cut its way to high margins. Murphy and Burke realized that the key drivers of profitability in most of their businesses were revenue growth and advertising market share, and they were prepared to invest in their properties to ensure leadership in local markets.” Why? Why did they invest in expanding their market share because they realized this through trial and error. “They realized early on that the TV station that was the #1 in local news ended up with a disproportionate share of that market's advertising revenue.” And a great way to think about this is another description by an early employee at Cap Cities, “‘The company was careful, not cheap.’ The company was careful, not cheap. The company's hiring practices were equally unconventional. Murphy and Burke shared a clear preference for intelligence, ability, and drive over direct industry experience,” because neither one of them, Murphy when he was hired and Burke when he was hired, they had intelligence of building drive. They did not have direct industry experience. And so they specifically targeted what they called “talented, younger foxes with fresh perspectives. Murphy and Burke were also comfortable giving responsibility to promising young managers. As Murphy described it to me, ‘We'd been fortunate enough to have it ourselves and we knew it could work.’”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so one of the people they hired young was Bob Iger, they hired Bob Iger at 37. And before that, he had spent his entire career in broadcast sports, and they hired him to assume responsibility for ABC Entertainment. Another important trait that fueled their success is they had exceptionally low turnover part of this culture, right? And they talked about -- there's a rival broadcaster once remarked, this is another great line. “We see lots of resumes, but we never see any from Capital Cities.” Why? “Because the system in place corrupts you with so much autonomy and authority that you can't imagine leaving.” Again, a really great memorable language, “The system,” these are people that are inside the company. “The system in place corrupts you with so much autonomy and authority that you can't imagine leaving.” Capital Allocation So that was a description of more of operations where it fell under Burke. Let's go to Murphy and his capital allocation and the area of capital allocation, Murphy's approach was highly differentiated from his peers. “He eschewed diversification, paid minor dividends, rarely issued stock, and made active use of leverage. He would regularly repurchase shares and between long periods of inactivity, made the occasional very large acquisition. “The two primary sources of capital for Capital Cities were internal operating cash flow and debt. The company produced consistently, high industry-leading levels of operating cash flow. This high amount of cash flow provided Murphy with a reliable source of capital to allocate. Murphy also frequently used debt to fund acquisitions. Once he summarized his approach is this, ‘We take the assets and once we paid them off, we leverage them again to buy other assets.’ “Acquisitions was where Murphy spent the majority of his time. He did not delegate acquisition decisions, and never used investment bankers. To Murphy, as a capital allocator, the company's extreme decentralization had important benefits. And it allowed the company to operate more profitably than its peers, which in turn gave the company an advantage in acquisitions by allowing Murphy to buy properties.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“And know that under Burke,” remember Burke is an extreme, efficient operator, “they would quickly be made more profitable, lowering the effective price paid. When he had conviction, Murphy was prepared to act aggressively. “And Murphy was not impatient, Murphy was willing to wait a long time for attractive acquisitions. He once said, ‘I get paid not just to make deals, but to make good deals.’ When he saw something he liked, Murphy was prepared to make a very large bet. Much of the value created during his nearly 30-year tenure as CEO was the result of a handful of large acquisition decisions,” just a handful. “These acquisitions each represented 25% or more of the company's market cap at the time they were made. Murphy was a master at prospecting for deals. He knew what he wanted to buy, and he would spend years developing relationships with the owners of these desirable properties. He had a very unusual negotiating style. He would often ask the seller what they thought their property was worth. And if he thought their offer was fair, he would take it. And if he thought their proposal was high, he would counter with his best price. And if the seller rejected his offer, Murphy would walk away." So it says like he would never do well at auctions, he usually bid 60% or 70% lower than the winning bid. But that was very interesting. He’s like, you just told me what the price is. I think it's worth that. I won't even negotiate with you. I'll just say, okay, I'll take it for that amount. And if that doesn't work out, here's the best price I can do. There's no back and forth. Can we just agree on this? If not, let's just keep it moving. Outside of acquisitions, the second largest amount he spent was actually share repurchasing. He bought back over 1.8 -- he spent over $1.8 billion on share buybacks. That investment alone generated an excellent return for shareholders, 22.4% over 19 years. As Murphy says today, "I only wish I had bought more." And then the chapter closes with this interesting anecdote about this very unique culture. "He told me a story about a bartender at one of the management retreats who made a handsome return by buying Capital Cities stock in the early 1970s.

"When the bartender was later asked why he made the investment, he replied, ‘I've worked a lot of corporate events over the years, but Capital Cities was the only company where you couldn't tell who the bosses were.’" And then there's a postscript on the chapter that if you're interested in studying, they call -- this company, TransDigm, a contemporary doppelganger to Capital Cities. It says, "A contemporary analog for Capital Cities can be found in TransDigm, a little known publicly traded aerospace components manufacturer. "Like Capital Cities, the company focuses on very specific types of business with exceptional economic characteristics. And TransDigm evolved a highly decentralized corporate structure and operating system for optimizing the profitability of these specialized businesses." And there's actually an excellent podcast series I listen to that's actually produced. It's called 50X if you search in your Podcast Player. William Thorndike, so the author of this book, actually did a four-part series on TransDigm. So if you're interested in companies that are like Capital Cities and you want to listen to that podcast or you want to learn more, I'd highly recommend listening to that four-part series. I thought it was really good. I wish there were more books on -- I can't find any biographies on Thomas Murphy. I can't find a company history on Capital Cities, which seems like I'm making some -- I have to be making some kind of a massive mistake. So if you find either a biography on Thomas Murphy or a company history, please let me know, I’d gladly read it and then make a longer like more in-depth podcast episode on this. I'm always fascinated about learning more about and from the people that are admired by people I admire. The fact that Warren Buffett calls Thomas Murphy, his hero that Ted Turner says that these guys know what they're doing, that they were building an excellent multimedia, or a multibillion-dollar media conglomerate really piqued my interest. So I will leave a link down below. I assume you already have this book. It was #1 on Warren Buffett's recommended reading list for a long time. It's referenced over and over again.

I think they sell it at the Berkshire Annual Meeting every year as well. I actually did a podcast on a chapter of the book previously, it was Episode 94 on Henry Singleton, if you want to go back and listen to that. But just in case you haven't bought the book already, I will leave a link down below. And if you buy the book using that link, you'll be supporting the podcast at the same time. That is 328 books down, 1,000 to go, and I will talk to you again soon.

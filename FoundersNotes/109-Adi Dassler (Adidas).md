Before I get there, though, I want to start with the early life, the family business before Adidas and Puma of the Dassler family, how they had to deal with World War I. And then I'm going to immediately get into, after that, Adi's resourcefulness and his personality. He's, by far, my favorite character in the entire book. All right. So let's jump to -- we're going to be in -- well, this is, right -- this is actually right before -- well, I'll just read you. This is right before World War I, and then we're going to jump right after it. So it says, "When it was established in the 1920s, the brothers' shoe business put an end to their family's many years in the weaving industry." Okay, so let me stop right there. They were -- Adi and Rudolf were partners. We're going to call that, their family business, the Dassler Brothers Shoe Company. Eventually, they're going to split up. That's why the title says there's a huge family feud. And the two companies that come out of the Dassler Brothers Shoe Company, it has a different name. It's in German. There's no way I can even pronounce it, is what -- is Adidas and Puma, okay? Before we get there, we have to understand like what's taking place in their lives. So it says, "It put an end to their family's many years in the weaving industry. Their father, Christoph, was the last in a long line of Dassler weavers." Now, remember I said -- or the author said at the beginning of the book, they're ruling the sports shoe business from a medieval village. And so you have multiple generations of the Dassler families that were weavers. And this is coming to an end right at the time when Adi's essentially becoming an adult, okay? So it says, "Yet the industrial revolution made Christoph's skills obsolete, prompting him to switch to shoe production. His wife, Paulina," this is Adi's mother, "complemented her husband's meager earnings by setting up a laundry at the back of their house." This is important. "Aided by her daughter," so the mother and the daughter will clean the clothes, right, and it says, "the clean wash is then delivered around the town by her three boys." So you have Fritz, Rudolf, and Adolf. Adolf is Adi. "Known around town as the laundry boys."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. That little meager laundry room in the back of the house is also where Adi is going to start his shoe company, okay? So it says, and I'm going to go back a little bit in history, it says, "In August 1914, the two eldest Dassler boys, Fritz and Rudolf, were drawn into the war. They were among the thousands of Germans who believe they would be back in a matter of months, but would spend 4-long years away from their home in the muddy trenches." "Just months before the end of the war, Adi turned 17, and he's drafted." So he has to go to the front. "The war ends. When the Dassler brothers returned, the 3 hardened men found their mother's laundry empty. In the post-war misery, there weren't many who could afford to have their clothes washed by somebody else." So this is seizing an opportunity here. My father is not a weaver anymore, the family -- the meager family business that we have is out of business. Like, we have to find ways to support ourselves. This is it. So it says, "Adi rapidly made up his mind. He would build up his own small shoe production unit right there in the former laundering shed." Now, this is where we're going to get into the amount of resources on this. And this is part of what I admire most about Adi. First of all, like I'm going to repeat this over and over again, he has soul in the game. He is completely focused on making the highest-quality product he can make where his brother is more about making money, right? And I'll go into more detail on that in a little bit. But it's also like you have to respect his resourcefulness. And what I meant by it, and this is really inspiring, is because post-World War I, Germany, like, there's no materials, there's a lot of poverty. There's not even that much electricity, which is where -- so we're going to see how the hell do you start the company that becomes Adidas in these conditions. So it says, "Adi spent many days scouring the countryside, picking up all sorts of army utensils left behind by retreating soldiers. He's scavenged for any debris that could be remotely useful and hauled it back to his workshop. Strips of leather could be -- come from army helmets and bread pouches to be recycled as shoe soles. Torn parachutes and army haversacks were more useful for slippers." Now, this blew my mind, "To make up for the lack of electricity, Adi came up with an equally clever device. Among his early inventions was a leather trimmer affixed to a bicycle frame, which his friend," this is actually his first employee, "would pedal to get the band turning. The ingenious young men built up his trade with sturdy shoes that could be expected to last for several years.” So that's how they generated their own power. And there's actually -- I found a picture online of this. It's a bicycle frame with a bunch of straps, and they're literally getting electricity by turning the pedals. So he's doing this for several years. And he just -- that's another thing you just have to understand about Adi, he's very meticulous, very methodical, and he's completely focused on quality.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"At a time when money and sports were still 2 separate worlds, the most admired athletes and soccer players enjoyed dropping by in the small Bavarian town for a chat with Adi Dassler, the ingenious German cobbler behind Adidas. On the other side of the small river that runs through the town, the guests were just as impressive." "Just after the war, Rudolf Dassler had walked over after a blazing fight with his brother Adi and set up Puma, a competing brand. Their feud shaped the modern sports business, giving rise to corruption and ever-increasing financial stakes. For several decades, the bickering Dassler brothers ruled over the sports business from their medieval village, their shoes featured in nearly all the emblematic pictures of sports history." "The Americans started hijacking the business in the '80s when the sons of Adi and Rudolf were spending most of their time fighting each other. Distracted by their own devious rivalry, the two Dassler cousins ignored the rise of the hard-hitting American upstart. Once it trashed Adidas and Puma in the United States, Nike set out to capture the European sports business."

Okay. So that's an excerpt from the beginning of the book -- from the book that I read this week, and the one I'm going to talk about today, which is Sneaker Wars: The Enemy Brothers Who Founded Adidas and Puma and the Family Feud That Forever Changed the Business of Sports, and it was written by Barbara Smit. The reason I started with that excerpt, I'm still not sure what I'm going to name this podcast if I -- because most of -- like what I personally enjoyed and what I want to focus on is Adi Dassler, but there's a lot of just interesting things about the family. So I have a feeling like the podcast will just be called The Dassler Family because there is a bunch of notes and highlights I have regarding how they ran their business that feels interesting. But the reason I bring that up is because this book, I'm going to read a couple of like the blurbs on the front and back cover. It was not at all -- when I picked that up and started reading it, I had one image in my mind of what I thought I was going to learn like specifically the founding of Adidas and Puma. And there's just so much more to this book. So it says -- this is from The Washington Post, it says, "Smit gets behind the business proposals, marketing plans, and constant dollar signs to focus on the human aspects of how these warring brands succeeded, and why they faded." That's also why I wanted to -- I'm going to talk a lot about -- not a lot, but a good amount about Nike as well and the role that Phil Knight and Nike played in that. "It is that human component that makes Sneaker Wars read like a modern cautionary tale for those apt to turn big business into the most dangerous sports." And in the beginning, it says -- this is from the Wall Street Journal, it says, "A book you'll read at a sprint, an anecdote-rich history of competition, commercialism, and corruption." So that gives you a good idea. We're going to learn a lot more than just about the two individuals behind Adidas and Puma.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I'll get into more detail about why he was like that because one thing you want to know about him is he considered himself an athlete. So he was obsessed with sports. He liked running. He liked soccer. He did all the things, and he did this for his entire life. And so he just had a bunch of ideas. Like, you know what, the shoes and the stuff we're using, they could be better. And I can make them better. I can learn the skills necessary to make them better. And he did. So it says -- and now we need to talk about Rudolf though, "Three years into his venture in 1923, Rudolf stepped in. The partnership between the two brothers worked smoothly," at the beginning, right, "even with their contrasting personalities. Not much of a talker, Adi relished the time spent in his workshop. Rudolf, however, was loud," he doesn't say obnoxious, but he's obnoxious and extroverted, "and he was better equipped to head up the company's sales efforts. In fact, the Dasslers could hardly have picked a worse time to get their business going. The war victors had seized most of Germany's resources and millions of Germans were suffering from unemployment and hunger." So again, everybody is out of work. People are dying from hunger, in some cases. His father just got -- rendered obsolete. They don't have electricity, don't have resources. Adi didn't care. He just focused on his goal and kept step -- moving forward one step at a time. I think that's an extremely important lesson from his life. So he starts -- he's creating shoes, and they start very, very slowly. They may make 10 shoes a day, 20 shoes a day, stuff like that. And then eventually, they have -- he finds a distribution channel, a very valuable distribution channel.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so he started sending his shoes to the German sports clubs, right? It says, "By sending offers to sports clubs, the Dasslers raked in growing orders. They chiefly sold spikes and soccer boots. The breakthrough for the early company came when the coach of the German Olympic track and field team had heard about the spikes made by the sports enthusiasts." So it has the name of the business. I can't pronounce it. So we're going to call it the Dassler Brothers Shoe Company. Now here's -- there's a lot -- I mean, they're in Germany -- think about where we're at in human history, in time and geographic location. They're in Germany in between World War I and World War II. If you've studied any history, you know what's occurring, what phenomenon is occurring here. The rise of Nazism, okay? So I'm going to talk a lot about that because I wanted to answer the question, like, were these people Nazis or not. All right. So it says, "For the Dassler Brothers Shoe Company, Nazism was a formidable stimulant. Hitler's stooges implemented their theories with haste. And one of the most urgent tasks they set for themselves was to promote German sports." So they had this theory -- they had this ridiculous theory about we are a supreme Aryan race and Hitler wanted to prove it through acts of physical achievement. Well, the shoe company is making shoes for -- they're making the best sports shoes. And so of course, they're going to -- like, their business is going to benefit from this ideology. Okay. I'm a little conflicted in this part of the book, what I'm about to read, not the Nazism part, but I mean, obviously, I hold the same opinion you do, it's ridiculous. I love Adi's dedication to craftsmanship. He has soul in the game. I'm going to say that over and over again. I believe -- my personal belief is, like, if every company we interacted with or every organization that we had to deal with in our day-to-day lives were led by people with soul in the game, our lives would all be easier. They'd be better. We'd enjoy it more.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So Adi has that, but he also is not the best business person. And one thing that we've learned from all the founders and all the books that we analyzed in this podcast is, to quote Steve Jobs, like, "You have to watch your nickels," okay? You got to -- you have to build a great product, but you also have got to embrace -- like, you have to run the business in a profitable and intelligent manner. So it says, "The opposite characters of the two brothers were causing increasingly frequent risk. Rudolf, who drove the company's skyrocketing sales, rolled his eyes at Adi's obsessive tinkering." So they're both wrong here is what my point here, they're both not complete. "He regularly lost patience with his brother's aloofness." So that's Rudolf getting mad at Adi because he was aloof when it came to business matters. "As for Adi, he became increasingly disturbed by his older brother's somewhat ostentatious loud manner." They're not suited to be business partners. They have -- which is -- talent-wise, you could argue they were. But you have to like and get along with the people that you work with. And they just didn't. Okay. So I want to jump to something else here. I'm going to put the book down for a minute because, again, we talk about books are original links, they lead us from one idea and one person to another, right? But there's so much more. This book is more about like the history of Puma and Adidas and it goes -- I want to focus more on Adi, right? So I was so intrigued by -- I didn't know who he was before I picked up the book. I never even thought about him. I didn't know he existed. So I went and I found -- there's like, online, you see like the Dassler family and the Adidas company has like their own history of record. Like, you can read it, right? And so I want to pull out -- I read a bunch of that. I took some notes, pulled out some highlights, and I want to put the book down and do that.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And when I thought of -- I don't know. There's a documentary on Netflix. It's like -- it's about Bill Gates. It's like inside of Bill's mind or something like that. I don't even know what it's called. But in the -- the documentary was interesting because it talks about like Bill's -- like he's a ferocious reader. And he said something that I thought was kind of -- the documentary is just something that I personally thought was ridiculous. He said, like, he reads 275 pages in an hour. I don't read like Bill Gates. I'm not like -- my goal is not to read the most books ever. It's like to actually think about what I'm learning and reading. So I put the book down for a while and started doing additional research. And then I go back to it. I think that's the better way to -- like, books are tools. They're not like something -- like, I don't want to just gorge through. I don't know. I'd be shocked if Bill Gates could actually retain all that. I highly doubt that he actually can. So I want to jump to the Chronicle and Biography of Adi & Käthe Dassler, that's going to be his wife. And just pause at some stuff that I want to tell you right upfront because I wish I had known this before I read the book because it kind of -- this is like a brief outline I'm going to give you. Kind of like it helped me understand him more as a person. And I think putting this upfront is going to help you understand him and the entire Dassler family as we move through this. All right. So it says, "Adi Dassler himself was an accomplished and active athlete. He was also a precise observer. He recognized that the athletes of each discipline lack specialized shoes." Now that statement, this is now the norm, right? But understanding the impact Adi had on the world of sports and business, in his day, was not. This is an innovation that he's largely credited for. So it says, "In his eyes, this was a disadvantage. This is his concept. If an athlete wear shoes optimized for their specific sport, it would certainly result in improved performance."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

That statement to us today is completely obvious. 100 years ago, it wasn't though. "In Adi woke the idea that would guide his life and revolutionize sport. The sporting world needed specialized, dedicated, professional shoes for each specific discipline." So this whole idea, like there's undoubtedly areas in life now that the same thing is present today, that they could benefit from some kind of specification, whether it's equipment, software, whatever it is, there's a business opportunity, just taking it a step further and improving that. And that business opportunity is present 100 years ago, it's present today, it will be present 100 years in the future. That's not going to change. So it says, "After the First World War, Germany was mired in economic depression and conditions did not favor the successful founding of a company." I mean, some of this is going to be repetitive because it's also covered in the book, but I think it's important. "Where, during the time of crisis, would the material for his shoes come from and who would buy them? To earn a living, he repaired shoes for the citizens of this town he lived in. And to begin the production of sports shoes, he used various materials originally made for military use." I already told you that. So it says, "After the war, not only were raw materials in short supply, but the electrical service in Germany was also inadequate. Adi possessed an innovative spirit. With belts, he rigged a leather milling machine to a bicycle mounted to wooden beams, and the first employee worked the pedals to power the machine." So I loved that idea. It says, "During long hours of detailed work and refinement, Adi continued to develop his shoe models and even tested them himself." It talks about his personality here. "Adi was a quiet focused inventor." There's going to be a lot about Adi when I was reading that reminded me of Henry Force -- oh, excuse me, Henry Force -- Henry Royce, one of the co-founders of Rolls-Royce. If you haven't listened to the podcast I did on them, it's essential to anybody that cares about building quality products. It is on, I think, Founders #81. There's just a ton of similarities between these two people.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says -- now we're going to get in the beginning of his company. So it says, "In the first two financially difficult years, a dozen workers produced about 50 pairs of shoes per day." They were making mostly soccer shoes and then track shoes. "Together, they survived the economically challenging times, and in 1926, demand increased significantly. They had outgrown the family washroom. So Adi and Rudolf decided to take over unused production space." Now we're going to -- this is amazing because at the end of the book, I think they're saying Adidas is producing like 200,000 pairs of shoes a day, right, at the very beginning, they're producing 50. I think even before this, they're producing 10. But now we see, okay, start in a washroom, this is what I can do. Now they have a small factory, and they're going to start making about 100 pairs of shoes. It says, "At the second location, they installed more machinery and increased the staff to 25 people. They produced 100 shoes a day." Now here's -- a huge increase to their business is the fact that they took advantage of centralized attention on sporting events like -- especially the Olympics. And this is an example that had a huge impact on their business. Remember, Adi has his theory. He's like I'm pretty sure I can get better results if I make specialized shoes for what you're doing. And so he's also an athlete, speaks to athletes, they understand each other. So he's able to convince them to try out his shoes. This happens in the 1928 Summer Olympics. It says, "He was determined to use this world stage to prove that top athletes with proper shoes could run faster, jump higher and win more. Adi gave the German distance runner, Lina Radke, a pair of shoes he had developed. She won the race and became the new world record holder." So a ton of people are paying attention to what's happening. What do you think is going to be the end result if somebody breaks a new world record? They're going to want to know who that person is and what equipment they used. “With her gold medal, she confirmed Adi's theory and the whole world witnessed it. Higher, faster, further was possible with shoes from the Dasslers.” Isn't that crazy? Like, in our world, it's like, of course. Like, that's the point I'm trying to make earlier. There's a ton of things that people in the future, stating the time we're actually living in now, are going to look back and like, of course, like how did you guys not understand that. That phenomenon occurs constantly. And to us, it's just funny, it's like, of course, if you had specialized equipment like you would do better. And so the idea that Adi was the first person to actually act on this and then build a business around it is fascinating to me.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Another thing about Adi that I really, really, really respect, like he was obsessed. He's always learning. And this is something like the entire point. Why does this podcast exist? For that exact reason. Like, the idea that you graduate from school and you stop learning is silly. These people are terrible to do that. Adi was not one of those people. It says in 1932, this business was already booming. He's already having success. That's what he does. He decides to attend a shoe technical school in -- it's a town called like Pirmasens, I'm probably pronouncing that wrong, and it was known as a shoe town. So at the school and in this town, Adi deepened his knowledge of shoemaking business techniques and model building. Okay. So when I read that part, there's a bunch of things that popped up in my mind that are related to all these other books that I've read and analyzed, right? Not many people know, this is something Jeff Bezos would have done. The very early days of Amazon, it's like a handful of Amazon employees. He leaves Seattle, drives, I forgot how many hours, to take -- he paid for and took a 4-day course on bookselling. You got to have the humbleness to understand that there's -- you can learn it from everybody. You know what I mean? Like, Jeff Bezos is not -- Jeff Bezos then is obviously not the person he is today. He had to learn to become that person. Like, that's amazing to me that he's like, you know, my business is up and running, but like, I always want to learn more. That's why people like Jeff Bezos, Sam Walton, these people went to school on everybody. I just think that's so -- like, it's such an obviously good idea that it perplexes me why more people don't do that.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Now so that's the first thing I thought of. And then the second thing I thought of was like, okay, so Adi's paying to go to -- he already has probably the most successful shoe business in Germany at the time, right? So he pays, he's like, I can learn more though. Like, isn't that -- there's like a level of like humbleness there. Like, he's already the best. But he was like I can get better. But then the second thing is like there's a shoe town, right? And that made me think of Enzo Ferrari. I think it was back in Founders #97 or 98, I think it was 97. I did two. But I'm pretty sure this is in 97. But he talks about like -- Enzo Ferrari was one of history's greatest obsessives, right? He had this fanatical, singular maniacal focus on building racecars. And he talked about it that like it was also a product of where he lived in that small town. I think it was -- I pronounce it Modena. What he says, this is a quote from Enzo Ferrari, "It is my opinion that there are innate gifts that are a peculiarity of certain regions and that transferred into industry, these propensities may, at time, acquire an exceptional importance. In Modena, where I was born and set up my own factory, there is a species of psychosis for racing cars." That is a hell of a statement, "a species of psychosis for racing cars." So undoubtedly, according to Enzo, he was -- him and his company were benefactors, I think that's the word we're looking for, of this special psychosis. I think this is also present in -- there's a ton of industries that are -- even though it's weird because I'm like a huge proponent of remote work, and I just think that clearly, to me, the future of remote work is clearly like distributed, right, and that we're -- I think that's a major shift that we happen to be living through just like Christoph Dassler was living through the shift of being rendered obsolete like of weaving or whatever.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But there is undoubtedly like geographical locations today all across the planet that specialize in certain things. And so that, I guess, is what Adi benefited from. That's what Enzo Ferrari benefited from. I just think it's an interesting thing. It's just one paragraph that I was reading, and it spawned so many other thoughts. All right. Now I get to go to the part, I was like, what is up with the Nazi s_*_, man? Like, what are you doing here? And again, like, we're looking in the past. Like, we're not living in that culture or anything else. It obviously doesn't excuse it, but it's just like it's so obvious to us today, like that is a terrible, horrible idea. Like, how is that even possible? So I wanted to dig into that. I was like I need to know what you guys thought. It's -- well, let me read this part, and then I'm going to tell you where it's also hard to understand -- like, I grew up in America, right? We don't live in a totalitarian regime, like Nazi Germany. But I've told you in some of the podcasts before, like my father was born in Cuba before Castro. My family, my grandfather and my father and my grandmother had to flee Cuba because of Fidel's totalitarianism. I met a ton of Cubans when I was growing up that literally got on rafts and sacrificed -- that risk the lives of themselves. I'm going to get -- I got to calm down here. Okay. Let's try this again. I've met a ton of Cubans who sacrificed the lives of themselves and their children and put them on rafts. Could you imagine risk -- like, what conditions do you have to be living under to risk the lives of your children like that? That's insane. But one thing I learned from that experience was when you talk to them, there's no way to -- in a totalitarian regime like that, there's no way to accurately gauge except through their actions, I guess, how people feel about that because they're forced to lie.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

You can't go -- like, you couldn't back then -- I don't even know. It's probably the same today. But like, you could not publicly criticize the Castro regime. They'd kill you. So it's really hard to see like, okay, the Cubans are having this done to them, how many of them actually support Fidel and the Castro family? Or how many of them are forced to and doing so, like they're basically lying about it to protect their lives? I guess there is one way to see how they feel about it because there's been hundreds of thousands of people that risk their lives of their family and caught on makeshift rafts and just took off into the ocean. Okay. I wasn't expecting to talk about that. But it's important for this part of the story because you don't really know in those regimes who actually support them and who doesn’t. So let's get back to Adi. It says, "Shortly after the National Socialist German Workers' Party ascended to political power in 1933, Adi and his brother Rudolf felt pressured to join the National Workers' Party. It was a requirement if they wanted to remain in business, and foremost among the motivating factors for that decision was their obligation to maintain job security for more than 100 employees. To refuse party membership would have negatively impacted the business and jeopardized the workforce." So the equivalent I understood in my experience, to actively seek out -- and this has happened to people in my father's side of the family, this happened to them. That's why I'm so freaking emotional about this. But it says, "To refuse party membership would have negatively impacted the business and jeopardized the workforce." To do that in Cuba, you would have either been jailed or killed. So that's why -- I'm trying to understand what is taking place in the Dassler family at this time, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so it says, "Adi was unimpressed by the so-called movement and was never politically active. To him, it was athletic competition that mattered most. His sole purpose was to support athletes regardless of political affiliation, religious faith or ethnicity." And he winds up doing this. He winds up hiding Jewish people. Like, the reason I don't think he was -- like, believed in Hitler and what Hitler was trying to do is because like his actions -- like, even if he said, okay, I'm a part of the Nazi. I fill out the paperwork. I'm part of their organization, his actions, I think that's -- again, we talked about this all the time in the podcast, like you learn a lot more about people from their actions and their words. He's hiding Jewish people. He's like -- if he gets caught, he could die for that. But he also does something where he makes shoes for Jesse Owens. So this is what happens. So it says, "His sole purpose was to support athletes regardless of political affiliation, religious faith or ethnicity. The fact that he outfitted the African-American Jesse Owens with Dassler shoes at the 1936 Olympics under the scrutiny and displeasure of National Socialist leadership gave testament to his political disinterest." Okay. I want to go -- so I'm going to go away from that and go back to this idea I have where he just reminds me a lot of Henry Royce, my admiration for the fact that he had soul in his game, and then I want to learn more about his personality before we go back to the book. “He painstakingly studied the motions and mechanics of athletes. At the age of more than 50, as he had always had, Adi practiced numerous sports disciplines, simply to obtain insight needed to deliver the perfect shoe technology to the athlete. He wanted to completely understand the practical needs of the athlete and believe that was only possible if he was familiar with the demands of each discipline through personal experience.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He just -- David Ogilvy has a line, he says, "The good ones just know more." And Adi was one of those people. He says, “Using this knowledge, he developed shoes for track and field athletes, football players, tennis players, skiers, boxers, basketball players, bowlers, fencers and many more. Adi didn't just do things differently, he did them for the first time.” Throughout the sporting world, they spoke of his innovations. I think he winded up collecting something like 700 patents in his life, which would put him, out of all the people we studied in the podcast, #2: Thomas Edison, being #1; Adi, being #2; and Edwin Land, being #3. "In discussions with athletes, Adi's introverted manner fell away. He spoke their language because he saw himself as an athlete. He listened to their concerns and, in the process of finding a solution, spared no expense to address the needs of the athlete. His contemporaries subscribed him as ambitious, creative and tireless. When sporting events were being broadcast, he sat before the television with great concentration, precisely observing the movement of the sportsmen's feet. There exists many handwritten notes spanning his adult years that bear witness to Adi's passion for detail because no pads were always on hand throughout the home, so he could jot down his thoughts and ideas at every hour of the day." And then more, just how could you not like this guy? How could you not like? And as much as I admire him, I equally disadmire, that's not a word, I dislike his brother. And you'll see why. I'll get there in a minute. "Adi Dassler remained modest. He never sought the spotlight and seldom gave interviews. He was more interested in tinkering with new inventions, developing new ideas, and putting them to practical use. Throughout this creative process, he approached his work in a precise, earnest, structured, and always creative manner." Okay. That was a one hell of a tangent. Let me go back to the book. Let's talk a little bit more about the difficulties of building this business in World War II. This is before the brothers separate. So it says, "The war was trouble for the factory because it was subjected to tight regulations of the regime." This is the Hitler regime. "It was decided that the factory would not be shuttered," this was the government making that decision, "but its production was sharply curtailed."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So we just hit some highlights here. "Due to rampant shortages, the company's scrapped by to make the required pairs of shoes, and it even ran short of staff. Allied bombs virtually erased entire towns from Germany's map. The people in the town they're in shivered in their cellars when an incessant stream of bombers flew over to destroy large parts of neighboring towns. While Adi was clearly regarded as the linchpin of the company, his brother strode and posed himself as the company's leader." So he's very egotistical. We just went through, like, Adi's much more modest. He's just focused on craftsmanship. "His brother Rudolf could be incredibly harsh and mean. He rejected his sisters, pleas," this is -- any time I'm -- there's a pattern, if you listen to a bunch of these episodes. Any time I'm induced to a state of rage by what I'm reading, usually, it has to be with adults' mistreatment of children. I have no -- like, there's no slack in my life for people that are crappy to children. Like, children are like the best versions of humans ever. And somewhere along the line, they get corrupted into less likable adults. And so one of Rudolf's sisters, she's got young kids. And right now, Germany, they would -- there's people fighting. They were 14, 15, 16. It happened in World War I and II. Some of the people lied. Some people, they knew the age, and they were still sent over. But his sister was like, please employ my sons at the factory, so they don't have to go into the war because the factory is going to be requisitioned. What's that word I'm looking for? The factory is making things -- they start making shoes to the war effort and other things, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“And Rudolf rejected -- bluntly rejected his sister's pleas, saying there was enough family problems at the company. And so his sister says he could be incredibly harsh and mean. These two sons never returned from war. This is the beginning of the end of their relationship.” Adolf, that's Adi's full name, by the way. “Adolf's early release from military duties caused further skirmishes in the family. The decision identified the younger of the Dassler brothers as the most indispensable half of their leadership duo, which deeply irked Rudolf.” So this is the government saying you're so important to the factory that you have to stay there, so you're not going to fight in the war, right? But Rudolf had to fight. He was regarded as -- Rudolf regarded this as an unbearable injustice and was certain that his brother had plotted to have him sent away. More effects of running the business during and after World War II, the U.S. eventually shows up at their front door, to the factory. It says, this part blew my mind, "U.S. tanks halted in front of the Dassler factory. They were pondering the destruction of the building when a young woman stepped out. The 28-year-old Käthe Dassler," that's Adi's wife, "bravely walked towards the soldiers and pleaded with them to leave the factory intact. All the people in there wanted to do is make sports shoes," she explained. So they wind up -- she actually convinces them. "They leave the factory away, but then they need a place for their soldiers to stay. Right next to the factory was the family house.” So what also complicated relationships of the Dassler family is they all live in a giant house with wives and kids and everything else. So they wind up leaving the factory alone, but now a bunch of soldiers overtakes the Dassler family home.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Rudolf, during this time, was like going back and forth, and he eventually is like -- he tries to run away from -- he's like a deserter because he realizes like the war is over. Like, I'm not going to die. Like, it's clear that we haven't given up yet, but the allies are going to win. So he winds up getting caught from doing this. He almost dies. So this is crazy, too. It says, "The local Gestapo chiefs rounded up some of the inmates and instructed guards to bring them to”-- there's a word I don't know how to pronounce, I think it's Dachau. It's a famous concentration camp. So Rudolf is being sent to -- eventually being sent to this concentration camp. It says, "The 26 men were to walk the 200 miles to the concentration camp in chains attached two by two. The driver who is supervising the march, his name is Ludwig Müller, was instructed by a local officer of the SS to shoot the prisoners. Rudolf is one of these prisoners. Müller ignored the command and led the prisoners farther south, but they never reached Dachau," or however you pronounce that, "The convoy was intercepted by Americans, and Müller gladly let the prisoners walk back to their homes." Okay. So when he gets back, he's convinced that his brother set him up. And they start like -- he thinks he's betrayed, and this is when they break up. So it says, "His return caused ugly scenes as the two brothers and their wives intended to clear what had happened during the war. The rows," meaning fights, "were particularly explosive between Rudolf who became obsessed with his brother's supposed betrayals. To make matters worse, the two couples were still living under the same roof." Okay. So this leads to their inevitable separation. It says, "The separation between the two brothers was completed in April 1948. It paved the way for the registration of two separate companies. The youngest of the brothers then contracted his name, Adi; and his last name, Das, and that's where you get Adidas from. A-D-I, his first name; D-A-S, the first three letters of his last name. Rudolf took on another suggested -- suggestion, and it winded up being changed to Puma, which we know.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. This is how they split the staff, how Adi has to start over at the age of 46 and, in a way, the Adidas logo came about, which I thought was interesting. "Rudolf was joined by nearly all of the staff's administrative and sales staff. But since all of the technical staff had picked Adolf's side," I don't know why the author calls him Adi the whole time and he starts reverting to Adolf. So I don't want to confuse you. I'm going to change all these to Adi. It says, "But since all the technical staff had picked Adi's side, Rudolf's men didn't have anything to sell. Conversely, Adi quickly restarted production but lacked any sales force to speak of. In his late 40s, Adi Dassler had to crank up his business yet again." So it says, "Stripes had long been used to strengthen the sides of their shoes. But most of the time, they were invisible," this is really fascinating, "they were invisible because they remain at the same leather as the rest." So they were just functional. They were not for design, right? "This made it hard for Dasslers to back up their claim that some of the outstanding athletes have been wearing their spikes. On most pictures, even experts weren't able to tell which brand of spikes the runners had on their feet. But Adi Dassler figured that if the stripes were painted white, they could be used to make his spikes stand out from afar. Three stripes easily spotted from a distance that would clearly distinguish Adidas from competing brands of shoes." Now I mentioned earlier, I admire Adi. I don't admire Rudolf. So I want to go into a little bit about a different ways the two brothers operated their company. Adi was still most at ease behind his desk, poring over technical drawings. The only thing -- he was very like quiet, kind of hands off. "The only thing that Adi did not tolerate were sloppiness and ignorance. If Adi felt that somebody was not completely up to scratch, the poor guy was out. The same went for anybody who spoke up at meetings for the sake of it. He did not like people to just talk for the sake of talking. Adi just didn't have the time for these kind of people."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Rudolf ruled over his company more brazenly. He would burst into meetings with a resounding laughter, brimming with enthusiasm. Nothing wrong with that per se, but there's usually a dark side to people like that. When his mood swung, however, which occurred quickly and recurrently, the employees soon became aware of it. Rudolf made his presence felt loudly under any circumstances, cheering one minute and booming with anger the next." So I just couldn't work in an environment where I was being yelled at. This is not going to happen. And so that's kind of the environment Rudolf has. He's kind of like ruling over things with an iron fist. Some people are fine with that. Adults should be free to make their own personal decision. But it was like -- I thought about that when I was reading the book on Thomas Watson, just the way he would talk to his employees just made me cringe. Okay. So I need to introduce you to another main character in the book. It's Horst Dassler. Horst Dassler was the only son of Adi. He's going to -- Rudolf's going to have sons that work in the business as well. And this multigenerational feud continues. So Adi and Rudolf are going to never really reconcile. They'll talk a little bit, but they never maintain that relationship. They both die with the relationship in tatters. Same thing for their sons, right? That is a lot of -- like, the good in the book is focusing on Adi's craftsmanship. The bad is like the ridiculous personal nonsense that these people were not mature enough to overcome. And they wind up opening this giant door and in comes a super passionate, super smart Phil Knight. And he's going to -- when you're distracted and you're fighting, you're not going to succeed against somebody that's completely focused. And I'm going to talk more about that, too, because there's a lot of examples of that in the book, which I just absolutely loved. All right. So I want to introduce you to Horst first and then talk about -- he's got some good ideas for marketing, though. "On the weekends, Horst was often dragged along with Adi for lengthy runs in the forest. The young man relished the shared sports activities, which gave him time to forge silent bonds with his father." This is a quote from Horst, "My father wasn't exactly bubbly in terms of conversation. His words tended to be pragmatic." And unfortunately, Horst, his personality just is not -- Adi went on disowning his son before he dies. So I'll tell you that now.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And Horst is also -- I'm pretty sure he was a giant cokehead. I'm almost positive. The author never comes out and says it, but there's -- I mean, there is -- they talk about going to parties with giant bowls of white powder. But I'll tell you more about his personality. He's not like Adi at all. That doesn't mean he doesn't have skills, he didn't add value to Adidas. In large part, Adi didn't care about growing for the sake of growth. He just wanted to make the best products. Horst is really the one that fuels that growth. And also, they overleveraged themselves later on. The company has to sell -- the family has to sell it later. But Horst was an extreme character. It says -- so he sends -- there's some -- I don't know if it's Olympics. It's some kind of -- yes, Olympics, I think, in Melbourne, Australia. So Horst goes over and he starts -- he immediately starts making his own decision. It says, "The young Dassler heir demonstrated skills that could not be acquired anywhere. Instead of selling Adidas shoes, Horst would hand them out for free, and people did not like that." Remember, at this time, too, sports, as we think of it today, is gigantic, is it multitrillion? Like, globally, it's got to be, right? This is a huge industry. It was not like that at this time. There were still money being changed hands, but it was all like on the low, it's all corrupted. And the book goes into a lot of detail about that. So giving away things for free and doing it -- these were unique ideas then, right? "Horst convinced that the gifts would be a smart investment. He couldn't think of any better publicity for his business than a throng of athletes hitting the tape in three-striped shoes. The free shoes actually paid off. When the medals were counted, Horst Dassler proudly informed his parents that more than 70 of them had been won in Adidas. The athletes had received their free Adidas spikes with such eagerness that the brand seemed ubiquitous at the Melbourne Games." That's a smart move, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"The snapshots of many finishes were dotted with Melbourne spikes, yielding unbeatable publicity for Adidas." That's a real good idea. "When these pictures came out, all of a sudden, a lot of retailers became interested." So he's opening up distribution channels. There's nothing wrong with what he's doing here. Go back -- I'm going to go back and forth. I'm not going to spend that much time on Rudolf and Puma. I'm going to tell you more about -- well, this is the note I have for myself is, Rudolf, the death spot. "He constantly belittled to Armin." This is his son. So Horst is Adi's son, Armin is Rudolf's son. "He constantly belittled Armin often in public. Armin pleaded with his father to let him leave and study electronics, but Rudolf wouldn't hear of it. Armin was to learn the tricks of the shoe business as soon as he left college. This is all the more appalling since Rudolf displayed apparently unjustified indulgence towards his second son." His second son's name is Gerd. "Gerd was born 10 years after Armin. By openly favoring Gerd, he stimulated an aggressive and sometimes unhealthy form of competition between his two sons." "The disputes crushed Rudolf's wife. Once a joyous and courageous woman, his wife crumbled on the relationship with her despotic husband.” First of all, he can't run the company to save his life, makes a bunch of dumbass decisions. And then making your kids compete, like what are you doing? What are you doing? And then being like -- making your -- like having such like an iron fist at your wife, you don't have a relationship at that point. I hate people like this. Oh, this is funny. So I'm going to get a little bit into like where does this idea of like mixing money, sports and business come from. "And a German sprinter is going to learn while he's in America," that's the funny part, "that you can get paid for this." This didn't happen in Germany before this. And Adidas refuses -- initially refuses. Eventually, they pay off -- they engage in the corruption.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Horst may be one of the most corrupt people in the business of sports ever, I would argue. Adidas refused initially, but basically the exact opposite -- like, he has the exact opposite viewpoint of his father, okay? So it says, "the German sprinter spent some time in the United States." His name is Hary. That might be his last name. "Hary had learned that performers deserve to be rewarded financially. Hary appreciated this part of the American ethos and firmly intended to apply to his own athletic career. Hary bluntly inquired what Adidas would be prepared to offer to his commitment.” So this is really surprising because Adi, all -- like he was -- he did it for the love of the game. He's like, no, I built these shoes for you because they're the best shoes. They're going to help you perform better. So he gets mad. It says, "Dassler angrily refuses. Adi Dassler was still convinced that Hary would have forgotten about the money nonsense and that he would turn up in his Adidas spikes. He was utterly dismayed, therefore, when the German sprinter emerged from the tunnel in a pair of Pumas." So Adi is not going to pay him off, Rudolf will. "The sprinter's choice was at least partly motivated by a thick brown envelope." Now this is how payoffs happen, especially with Olympic athletes that were -- they were supposed to be amateurs. So there's an American sprinter, he shares what was taking place around this time in history. "The American sprinter would call it precisely how it was done.” I remember it. It was like in the James Bond or mystery movies. A shoe agent would go into the bathroom and leave an envelope under the stall. I would go into the stall after him. You'd get an envelope that had $700 or a couple of thousand dollars in it, and you thought you were rich. Okay. So this is something Horst would engage in with frantic cokehead-like energy. The guy didn't sleep. He worked all the time, was extremely paranoid.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I mean just if you list -- if you were to list his personality traits and you Google what are the side effects of cocaine, like they match up almost exact. Again, the author never says that. But there's -- if you read the book, I think you would arrive at the same conclusion. So he's got -- also, he's got other interesting ideas. He was very much more hands-on. He was becoming like a prototypical sports agent almost. He starts a bunch of other companies because he has an outgoing, party kind of personality, the exact opposite of his father. So he has this idea of the revolving dinner ploy. He does have some good ideas in a sense that, like, business is made up of relationships and certain businesses definitely are. But it's also like a very superficial, transactional level. Like, he dies really early, like, 51 from cancer. And like two days before he's dying, he's like writing notes to people. But he says like he was -- at the end of the life, he says he's personally unhappy. He's estranged from his wife and his two kids because he worked 24/7, and he had very few friends. He had like an -- like, he knew thousands of people but very few real friends. And that's just like -- like that's not -- that's a sad way for your life to come to an end. Like, this is not -- I don't know. Anyways, I'll get there in a little bit. So now "Once he's spotted an opening, Horst bulldozed ahead. Ignoring obstacles, he prodded his aides into immediate action." So one thing I do remind about him, he was driven and he understood that success in some parts -- to some degree, is a function speed. And so he went fast. He was racing at 200 miles an hour, and we were puffing behind, struggling to keep up. "Although contracts didn't stipulate that employees work on Saturdays, the office is usually full that day. Horst worked hardest of all. A workaholic by any standards, he always look for ways to exploit his time as efficiently as possible." So this is what happens. We see this a lot. You over-optimize in one part of your life, and your time is finite, so that means you're going to -- you're making a conscious decision, or maybe it's not even conscious, but you are making a decision whether you know it or not that you're going to make sacrifices in other areas.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

My point, the reason I bring this up so much, is because it happens in these books all the time. They do that, maybe they don't even mean to do it, and then they regret it later. It's -- we have to learn that. We're probably -- if that happens to them, they are humans just like we are, we might feel the same way. So that's why I keep bringing it up. So it says, "One of his most bizarre ploys was known as the revolving dinner. Three groups of people would be set up in separate rooms. Horst would have drinks with one group, sit at the table. Then as planned, he would be called away for an urgent meeting. He would then move on to the next group, eat an appetizer then be called away. And then on to the next one for dessert. At the end of the evening, all of those guests would feel they had dined with Horst Dassler." Now, this part is surprising, like why are you doing this? "Breaking into new countries and new markets at this time was a very slow, labor-intensive process." Again, I don't think Adi even cared about this, but Horst wanted Adidas to be like this giant global company. So it says, "At the beginning, Adidas received only piecemeal orders from French clubs and athletes. But Horst Dassler picked resourceful players, the kind who would scour the country on match days to hand out Adidas boots and spend many more hours cultivating friendships at the bars." They've been doing this on an individual basis. I'm going to infect one person on the team, and that person is going to spread my product to other areas of the team. "Extra rounds were bought for photographers if they promise a shoe closeups of Adidas boots." So he starts developing this huge network. This is very, very reminiscent of the tactics we discussed on the podcast about Mike Ovitz, the person that founded that the agency CAA. "Horst taught his employees to hook sportspeople by weaving together personal relationships." So this is -- we're going to see his personality. “Were you in the locker rooms with them for a snap? Do you know their names or their wives? Did you have lunch with them beforehand? Well, then what did you expect? Such attention were perfectly in line with Horst Dassler's motto, business is about relationships."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Now just like Horst took adidas to new levels, so did Armin, which is his cousin, his counterpart. It says, "The relationship between Rudolf and his eldest son had always been strained. It deteriorated further when Armin, having become more self-assured, began to question his father's conservative methods. Watching Horst, Armin acknowledged that the sports world was undergoing rapid changes. And unless he was able to allow to steer Puma in the right direction, the company would be entirely left out." So Armin sees a huge opportunity. He thinks that this is post-World War II. He's like you have this giant, growing market in the United States, like we need to go over there. "Armin discretely exploited openings to sell Puma products in the United States. He had already been sent out there by his father shortly after the war, and his visit has made a strong impression on him. He saw Puma would be at a huge advantage if it managed to make its mark in that country." So both of the cousins are doing essentially the same thing. They're expanding their business against the wishes of their family, okay? So there's a bunch of thesis in that. I'm going to skip over. But it says, "Horst has attained an altogether different stature. No longer was he the affable young German with a handful of spikes. Instead, he had turned into a respected entrepreneur, the international face of Adidas. Horst was seizing control of his parent's brand," okay? So it's a contrasting -- now it's going to lead to a falling out with his father. "The contrasting attitudes led to rancorous discussions between Horst and his parents but he staunchly refused to be held back by their conservative ways." And they just weren't ready. They really didn't have an interest in doing that. They were fine just running it as a family business. "Horst effectively resolved to compete against his parents." And this is where we see like unbelievable levels of duplicity on his part. He starts competitors that they don't know about. He funnels money that was meant for the growth of Adidas to other personal projects. He eventually builds like a web of offshore companies all over the globe. They are so complex. He doesn't even know what's making money and what's not.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Again, this is very like -- I said it, he acts like a cokehead. And so the way he's running the business, his father is very upset, and his father was in 70s at this time. So it says, "Adi watched the business with an increasing detachment. Now in his early 70s, he was tired of the relentless complaints from his managers, his wife and his daughters." So they have -- Horst is running the international expansion of Adidas. The family, including the daughters, are focused on the German aspect of the business. And they're just -- they're not -- they start fighting within each other. And so not only are they internally fighting within Adidas, they're also like paying attention to Puma because of the family feud that happened 30 years earlier. And what's going to happen? You just -- you have to focus. You just opened this a giant door, and here comes Phil Knight. If you haven't listened to the podcast I did on Phil Knight, his book Shoe Dog is one of the best books on entrepreneurship I read. It's Founders podcast #10. But more than that, I really think that the opening of that podcast is probably one of the best, if not the best opening, of any Founders episode because it's like this inner monologue. I think Phil Knight is something like 24 years old at the time. And just like everybody else goes to this, like, what am I going to do in my life, like especially at that age, you have this huge uncertainty. Like, everybody goes through that. And he's on the run. He just goes in this inner monologue. He's like, "What if I just pursue my crazy idea?" And that decision led to Nike. It's remarkable. Anyways, all right, so it says, "Another contender that threatened to upset the almighty Dasslers at the Munich Olympics was a small American company called Blue Ribbon Sports." Obviously, that's Phil Knight's company before he changed the name to Nike. "It had been set up by Philip Knight, a lanky, middle-distance runner and a graduate of Stanford Business School. Then known as Buck, Knight had always run in Adidas. But he thought in outrageous that American students should be more or less condemned to buy expensive German spikes."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"In his Stanford paper, he outlined a business plan to launch a competing brand.” So this is the question that launches Nike or what eventually becomes Nike. "Can Japanese sports shoes do to German sports shoes what Japanese cameras did to German cameras?" he asked. I love picking -- the idea of picking out insights from other industries and applying it to like saying, hey, that idea worked over one industry, it'll probably work in this one. There's a huge -- there's a number of examples in history where that's successful. It's a really good like a framework mental model, whatever you want to call it. All right. So I'm going to skip ahead in the book, and I'll go back in time. But I want to stay on this Nike thing, okay? So now we're jumping ahead, I don't know, maybe a decade. I think Adi's already dead and Rudolf is already dead now. But anyways, I want to talk about how Adidas opens the door for Nike with its incompetence. And there's a lot taking place in this section. The idea that they're dismissive about Nike's new technology. They call it a toy. How many times have people discounted new inventions and they say, oh, it's a toy. The fact that Nike propelled what, at the time, was the new sport, known as jogging, they were very dismissive, oh, it's not a real sport. And the fact that Nike is not a threat because we're a much larger company. Yes, but Nike is growing faster. And you're not, you're shrinking. Eventually, they're going to intercept. All right. So let's go there. So one of the brand representatives in the United States for Adidas, he knows that Nike's exploding. So he goes back to Germany. He's trying to tell him is like, hey, you guys need to check this out. It says, "He figured that Adidas technicians would be interested, but the response was invariably dismissive. The waffle," the waffle shoe, the running shoe, "designed by former coach Bill Bowerman," this is Phil Knight's partner, "in his kitchen provoked outright hilarity. They inspected the sample as if it was a piece of dirt. They pulled at it and then they threw it. They thought it was a big joke. These lunatics who designed shoes with a waffle iron."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Yet the -- and so it says, they didn't see that Nike is a problem because Adidas had so much demand that they couldn't keep up with them, right? So like, they would have suppliers in the United States that placed an order. They wouldn't get to the result -- their order for like a year. And so they're like, Nike is no threat. Like, we have more business we can keep up with. Yes, but you're not delivering the business on time. What do you think, everybody is going to wait around a year to get your shoes? So it says, "Yes, the dearth of Adidas supply played strongly into the hands of Nike. In the exploding American market, retailers became so weary of the haphazard Adidas deliveries that they could not afford to turn down an alternative," alternative brand that is. "To push this advantage," and Nike takes advantage of that. They're like, oh, okay, check this out. This is really smart. "To push this advantage, Nike introduced a shrewd mechanism known as futures. In other words, they shifted some of the financial risk to their retailers," so people that wanted their product. "In return, the retailers who took part in futures would obtain a sizable rebate on their orders and could rest assure that they would actually obtain the goods. In a market driven by wild demand, this was an unbeatable argument." So you could have a shoe that no one knew existed. And then overnight, maybe like a soccer or a tennis player can win the Wimbledon or whatever, and then you have 100,000 orders the next day. That's what they're talking about. And so what they did is like, hey, if you give us the money early and you commit to buying x amount of Nikes, we'll, first of all, guarantee that we get it to you on time; and two, we'll give you a discount. And so Nike would take the money from the retailers, give it to their manufacturers in Asia and essentially have the retailers finance the growth. That's the exact opposite of what's happening with Adidas. Adidas owned a lot of their factories. And that's why -- and they had a crappy logistics system. So it says, "With the jogging boom in the '70s, Nike's advances turned into a tidal wave. At the forefront of the movement, Bill Bowerman led many thousands of otherwise unathletic Americans on daily jogs. And this newly formed army of leisurely runners turned to Nike en masse."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Another smart technique by businesses, we've seen this applied in other ways. Like, what is your product used for? Don't focus on selling your product, focus on growing what it's used for. Lululemon did this beautifully in the last decade and a half. They didn't try to sell you athleisure, or whatever it's called, they grew the sport of yoga or the practice of yoga, whatever you want to call it, and then, hey, if you're into yoga, you're going to come buy my clothes. Hey, if you're in jogging, you're going to buy Nikes. Brilliant. "The German technicians dismissed the trend by contending that jogging is not a sport." You don't get to decide what other people are interested in. This is the height of arrogance. This is the exact opposite of the opinion of their founder. This says, and I wrote focus in caps with explanation points. Horst Dassler was equally guilty of aloofness when -- he's running the company full force now. Adi is dead at this point. "Horst Dassler is equally guilty aloofness when it came to Nike, absorbed by his sports marketing and broadcasting rights business." He's running other businesses and Adidas at the same time. You're not going to beat somebody that's running only one business. You have to focus. He didn't display much concern about the Nike issue. He eventually agreed to meet Phil Knight. So they go to a trade show. He winds up meeting him. He says -- but he's got a big mouth because he's probably on drugs. "The Nike men couldn't believe what they just heard. Horst Dassler had let it slip that a strong Adidas shoe sold about 100,000 pairs each year in the United States. Blue Ribbon was selling roughly the same amount of waffle trainers a month." So again, outside appearances can be deceiving. Nike didn't have that information. At the time, Adidas is doing more in overall sales. They're selling more shoes in different countries. They're selling clothing, doing all those other stuff.

But they're like, wait a minute, we're on to something. You're only selling -- your best shoe is selling 100,000 a year? While this new invention that we made and all the other smart, tactical decisions we did, we're doing that in a month. At that point, you know game, set, match. You've already won. The other person just doesn't even know it. And that's inevitable. Few years after this, Adidas has to be sold. They started losing tons of money. Horst is -- again, I told you, he's got a lot of good ideas, but he's got more bad ideas than good ideas. And he was not good. They're like -- I've read some people say like, he was a genius businessmen. No, I disagree. I disagree fervently. He was not a genius businessman. His father -- he built on the innovations of his father. I'm not calling Adi a genius businessman, but he built high-quality products. And it's his focus on like this expansion and this distraction, all stuff. So like, you had a good business here and you ruined it. That's my point. Like, this happens a lot. And we do it. It's like self-inflicted. I don't know. I just -- it's so beneficial reading these books because you realized a lot of times what not to do, and that's very powerful. And both families are guilty of this. I want to go back in time, we're going to see how Adi and Horst were never on the same page, and then we're going to see Rudolf and Armin doing it. It's so -- like, it's funny how you ever see two groups of people or two people you might know that hate each other and you happen to be friends of both or whatever the case is. And so you can extrapolate this out into like tribes that fight each other within sports or whatever you like. You people are going to see they're way more similar than you think. So we see that in the relationships with their sons. So he gets really mad because Horst starts making Adidas clothing, and Adi just wanted to make the best shoes.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he says -- and he's yelling at this time, “Horst, you won't spare me anything. He burst out indignantly. Sure enough, you have done well for us. But bathing suits? Never. Have you gone completely mad? Never under the Adidas brand. Adidas is about shoes, and swimmers don't wear any. At the receiving end of these furious tirade, Horst Dassler retained his cool. It didn't matter if he replied calmly. If his parents refused to launch swimwear under the Adidas brand, he would launch it under a brand called Arena." This is all the side businesses he makes. But the problem is he's taking resources away from Adidas to funnel his side business. "It was an escape route that would enable him to develop its business without his family's consent." Okay, so that's what's happening at this time in the -- I was going to say the Dassler family, but not Dassler family, in Adidas family compared to the Puma family. So let me go back to Rudolf because he's about to die, right? So it says, "Unbeknownst to many of the family members, Adi and Rudolf had met up several times." They had at least 4 lengthy discussions over the years. I think they were both in the early 70s when this was happening. I wouldn't -- reconciliation, no, but they did talk. "The night of Rudolf's death, the chaplain," I guess this is from the church, "placed the call to Adi. But Adi declined to cross the river and embrace his brother one last time. But he conveyed his forgiveness. Rudolf passed away shortly thereafter. Now with the death of his father, Armin, his son, could run the company as he pleased without interference from his bullying father. This marked the beginning of a remarkable run for Puma, with sales multiplying fivefold in 10 years.” “Yet, Armin still couldn't measure up with his cousin Horst who is warming his way into the most influential spears of the sports business.” Assuming he like -- he starts selling promotions, sponsorships, excuse me, just growing the brand. But I want to fast forward because this is the author where she's like it's a remarkable run. Yes, remarkable in the sense of like, yes, they did more in sales, but a lot of that was unprofitable growth. And so eventually, Puma, they sell stocks, and the bank takes it over. They lose the family business.

And before I read you this part -- this section, I'm going to jump ahead of time and then go backwards, right, because I'm trying to organize it by the Puma side and the Adidas side. But when I'm reading this section, and you have families, it starts with two brothers fighting each other, then their family, them fighting the descendants of each family, then internally -- like, everybody is fighting and like overwork. And my thought was like entrepreneurship should be a force for good. If you have a business that makes you miserable, somewhere along the line, you lost the plot. You took something, one of the greatest inventions in human history, one of the best things that we as a species have created, and you turned it from a huge asset for your family to a disastrous liability. So skipping ahead. When it's -- this is now Armin. Armin lost control of Puma. And so it says, "He crashes on the couch in a state of utter despair. He had returned from a meeting at Deutsche Bank. The bankers said that they were preparing to remove him from the company. “You have lost your business,” he was apparently told. “This was a devastating blow for Armin who had dedicated his life to Puma. He had weathered the humiliations inflicted by his cousin and worked relentlessly to make sure that Puma could continue to compete. It was hard for him to comprehend how anonymous bankers could take his family heirloom away from him." "From then on, as his wife saw it, Armin would never be the same again. A few short years later, he dies. It was no longer a family-owned business, and it seemed that the new proprietors could barely wait to erase the family's legacy at the company. Armin Dassler became increasingly prone to depression. He passed away at the age of 61. Although it was cancer that destroyed his body, Armin Dassler's family remained convinced that he was mortally shattered by the loss of his company. Put it this way, his widow said, he didn't fight."

All right. So I want to spend the rest of my time talking about Adi. I'm going to go back in time, Adi's still alive. He made like -- he never stopped inventing and improving, right, till the day he died. And I found -- I learned a bunch of stuff like Muhammad Ali, like Adi personally made Muhammad Ali's shoes -- boots, I guess, boxing boots, or whatever the case is. Like, he'd listened to what they needed, and it was fascinating. Even like he's running -- he owns this giant company, he's still working on an individual level to understand the needs of his customers, and Muhammad Ali was his customer. It's fabulous. And there's this one sentence in the book that just made me smile because it talks about the level of Adi's craftsmanship when it comes to -- like, he built such a high-quality product that communists would be forced to ignore their capitalistic origins. So it says, "Adidas was of such undeniably superior quality that the East Germans were prepared to turn a blind eye to its capitalistic origins." That is fantastic. More about Adi. Well, you know what, there's something else. The benefit -- like, I don't want to spend too much time on Horst because I find him, in general, to be a distasteful human being. But there is something -- he did teach me something that's another example of books are original links. He got really into the sports marketing business, whatever you want to call it, and he introduced me to a Mark McCormack. I never even heard of him before. But he says, "Horst Dassler could not fail to observe the rise of professional sports agent," he was right about these things, "who made their money by seeking lucrative sports endorsements for media-friendly athletes." So Horst would do that. He organized a company doing that. He says, "The instigator of this business was Mark McCormack, an American lawyer who launched his agency in the 1960s on the back of a handshake with golfer, Arnold Palmer. McCormack soon turned into the rainmaker of the sports marketing business and his company, IMG, into a sprawling sports and entertainment group. So I've heard of IMG before. I wasn't familiar with Mark McCormack. He wrote a bunch of books. I just ordered some. So he'll probably turn up into a future episode of Founders.

But I want to go back to Adi. So right before his dad dies, Horst shares with his friends or his close colleagues, whatever you want to call them, it says, "He shared his sadness and showed them long bitter letters in which Adi disowned his son." So it got so bad between them that their relationship was never the same. I think right before he died, they might have reconciled somewhat, but it is too late. So I want to talk to you more about -- what's fascinating to me is this level of focus Adi had that he maintained his entire life. It says, "Adi continued to walk around with his notepad and to tinker in his workshop. The obsession that drove him perpetually to seek improvements for his shoes never faded. Over 5 decades, he registered nearly 700 patents to his name. In his 70s, Adi Dassler continued to shy away from the honors that were bestowed upon him. When strangers turned up at his gates hoping to catch a glimpse of Adi Dassler, he turned them away unceremoniously." This is somebody talking about something they observed. "One day, he was walking his dog in the compound when someone called to the fence asking for Adi Dassler. Adi just shrugged, ‘I don't know,' he told the visitors, 'I'm the gardener.' He clad in his three-striped sweatpants. He tended to look the part. Adi once confessed to his friend that he didn't have a clue how many factories Adidas owned. And frankly, he didn't care."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"By 1978, the company he founded in his mother's washroom employed nearly 3,000 people in Germany alone. About 180,000 pairs of three-striped shoes were produced daily. By then, Adi had been advised to slow down. He had been generally told, after a medical checkup, that he should cut back on soccer and tennis, which he still regularly played. On August 18, 1978, he was failed by a stroke, and he passed away at the age of 78. The Dassler family followed his strict instructions to keep pompous speechmakers and other intruders at bay to make sure the funeral would remain private." And I'm going to leave the story there.

"Orville's first teacher in grade school would remember him at his desk tinkering with bits of wood. Asked what he was up to, he told her he was making a machine of a kind that he and his brother were going to fly someday."

I'm David Senra, and you're listening to Founders, my podcast about the biographies of founders. I got the idea for this podcast from listening to another podcast years ago. Elon Musk was being interviewed and said something that stuck with me. He was asked, "When starting a company, who did you look to for advice?" Elon said he looked for feedback in a historical context, books basically. He continued, "I didn't read many general business books. I liked biographies and autobiographies. I think those are pretty helpful." So that made me think, if Elon found biographies useful, why not start reading them all the time. Then I decided to share what I learned from reading these books and create this podcast. So with that said, I'm going to tell you some of the ideas I learned from reading The Wright Brothers by David McCullough. Before we begin, this episode is brought to you by Audible.

All right. So let's get right into some ideas that I found valuable in this book. This -- before I read this excerpt, this is the note I left myself, was entrepreneurship is action. And let's go right to the book. He says, "To judge by the expressions on their faces, they had little, if any, sense of humor, which was hardly the case. Neither liked to have his picture taken. 'Truth to tell,' one reporter wrote, 'the camera is no friend either to the brothers. But what is most uncharacteristic about the post is that they are sitting and doing nothing, something they almost never succumbed to.'" "The brothers had tremendous energy and working hard every day but Sunday was a way of life and if not on the job, then at home on improvements. Hard work was a conviction, and they were at their best and happiest working together on their own projects at some waist-high bench. What the 2 had in common above all was unity of purpose and unyielding determination. They had set themselves on a mission." So that term right there, after reading the book, now this is my second time reading through it, unyielding determination, I think that's the best 2-word description of the Wright brothers. This next part is advice from their father, and it's just a quick sentence -- 2 sentences that they kept the lessons, a lot of lessons from their father they would repeat throughout their entire lives, even up until the point after their father passed away. So their advice from their father was make business first, pleasure afterward and that guarded. All the money anyone needs is just enough to prevent one from being a burden on others. So I want to tell you this -- moving ahead, I want to tell you this little excerpt about something that happened to Wilbur Wright when he was a young boy and how he took a tragedy and turned it into something that changed his life.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And the note I left myself is there's this great video on YouTube from this guy named Jocko Willink, who also has a podcast called Jocko Podcast. And he has this concept of good. And I'll leave a link to the YouTube video in the show notes, and it's available at founderspodcast.com. But the basic -- the theme of the 2-minute video is there's going to be a lot of things that happen throughout your life that are bad, that you have little to no control over. All you can really control over is the action you take next, so basically saying, look for the good in -- when you're going through a tumultuous or a bad situation and then focus on that, reengage and get back towards whatever like you're working towards. So it's almost like a form of stoicism. And reading this excerpt, that idea popped into my head. So let's go to when Wilbur is a boy. "Wilbur was smashed in the face with a stick, knocking out most of his upper front teeth. What exactly happened is hard to determine. But to judge from the little that is known, there is much more to the story. According to an entry in Bishop Wright's diary written years afterward" -- so Bishop Wright is their father. "The man who threw the bat that struck Wilbur became one of the most notorious murderers in the history of Ohio, Oliver Crook Haugh, who, in 1906, was executed for the murders of his mother, father, and brother, and was believed to have killed as many of -- as a dozen others besides. At the time of the hockey incident, Haugh lived just 2 blocks from the Wrights. He was only 15 or 3 years younger than Wilbur but as big as a man as was -- and was known as the neighborhood bully. As would be written in the Dayton Journal following his execution, Oliver never was without the wish to inflict pain or at least discomfort on others."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"After the accident, Wilbur remained a recluse, more or less homebound for fully 3 years, 3 years when he began reading as never before." So after this accident, he's bedridden. He's taking a long time to recover, this is the early 1900s, and he starts reading books on flight. So we're going to get there in 1 second. This next idea that stuck out to me was the importance of reading, something I talk about all the time on the podcast, something that's been a lifelong hobby of mine. And the entire reason I do the podcast because I do believe that, if people read more, their lives would be better. The ability to focus on an idea for a long period of time, I think, is an anecdote to -- or an antidote, sorry, to the short burst of dopamine that we get just checking our social feeds all day. It's the exact opposite. And I think the way any of us feel after scrolling through feeds of mostly junk all day is unpleasant compared to when you're really interested in the book and you spend many hours in a one-sided conversation with the author. And the feeling that you get when that book is done, it's a pleasurable -- there is like a melancholy feeling that I've talked about before, how you finish a book and it was so good, you don't want it to end. But it is pleasurable to get -- to learn new ideas, to expand your curiosity. And I think books, it's just an easy way to do that long form, where you can spend 5, 7, 15, 20 hours having a one-sided conversation with somebody that's thought deeply about the subject so much that they spend years of their life writing the book. So this is the importance of reading, and I'm not alone with that conviction. "The Wright family book collection, however, was neither modest nor commonplace." The reason they're saying they're not modest or commonplace because they grew up very humbly, and we'll get into that in a little bit. But one thing -- one area they didn't hold back on, they weren't cheap in, in that sense, was books. So it says, "It was neither modest nor commonplace."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Bishop Wright -- again, that's their dad, "a lifelong love of books, heartily championed the limitless value of reading. Between formal education at school and informal education at home, it would seem he put more value on the latter. He was never overly concerned about his children's attendance at school. If one or the other of them chose to miss a day or 2 for some project of interest he thought worthy, it was all right. And certainly, he ranked reading as worthy." And a byproduct of reading is you have these ideas that they just stick in your mind and they never go away. And so the note I left myself was something they read became a part of their way to get through life. And it's just 2 sentences. It says, "Every mind should be true to itself, should think, investigate and conclude for itself." So in other words, you reject dogma, and you try to apply your own first principles thinking about what is actually happening. So I don't know if I talked about this in the podcast, but in the book, there's many people that have written about human-powered -- machine-powered flight for humans to figure out a way to fly. And they even had some calculations based on theories and the like. And what would happen is the Wright brothers would just learn through trial and error, right? And so they're very first flyer -- there's an example in the book where the very first flyer winds up doing spectacularly well. I think the first flight is like maybe a minute long or something like that. And they have a series of experiments. They're very happy. So they go back home and they build the second flyer. But on the second flyer, instead of using the same ratios that they discovered through trial and error, they started using ratios written about by people that had never flown but had thought they knew the math or the way -- like the answer behind it, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And what happens is they take off and immediately crash. And this whole sentence where it says, "Every mind should be true to itself, should think investigate, include to itself," that theme comes up over and over and over again in the book from inventing the flyer to making it just a glider, then to making it machine-powered, then to building the company and operating in an arena -- again, these were inventors and tinkerers. And all of a sudden, they had the world's most valuable product, and they had to navigate on how become high-level businessmen. Now they did have a small business, and I'm going to talk about that, the importance of having like a side project, that sustained all these experiments. But they would never operate at such a scale before, and they were able to navigate that so successfully because they believed in their own thought processes and their way that they could basically think things through and then apply those thoughts into action and navigate these environments and experiences than they actually had before. So something I always like to talk about when reading these biographies, because everybody knows who the Wright brothers are, just like everybody knows who Walt Disney is, Jeff Bezos, all these other people, but what's fascinating to me is, in reading these biographies, you see them way before they became who we know them as. So I'd like to talk about the first job they have, so -- and see how industrious they were. So this is Orville's first job, and then it winds up being Wilbur's first job too. "While still in high school, Orville started his own print shop in the carriage shed behind the house. Interested in printing for some while, Orville had worked for 2 summers as an apprentice at a local print shop. He designed and built his own press using a discarded tombstone, a buggy spring, and scrap metal. With the paper" -- so they started a newspaper.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"With the paper showing some profit, Orville moved the business to a rented space on West Third Street, where the city's electrics trolley ran; and Wilbur, now 22, was prominently listed as editor." The next section is, "You need less than you think you do." And this talks about the pretty humble beginnings of the Wright brothers. Their lives are pretty simple. "The brothers were well into their 20s before there was running water or plumbing in the house. Weekly baths were accomplished sitting in a tub of hot water on the kitchen floor with the curtains drawn. An open well and wooden pump out house and carriage shed were out back. There was no electricity." So I want to tell you a little bit about the beginning of their side business. So I don't know how many people know this, but the only reason they were ever able to be successful in creating the first nonhuman-powered flight machine was they had -- they saw a trend with bicycles, and they decided to open their own bicycle shop. So let me just tell you a little bit about this from the book. Now the first paragraph is interesting to me because I feel -- I've talked about on the podcast that history never repeats. Human nature does. And this whole idea that -- and it's strange to me. So the note I just thought to myself -- had a note left to myself, the note I left to myself here was humans are in a state of constant change. You have -- fear change in our nature. And there's all kinds of examples from history on this. So this is -- the first paragraph is the -- what, in hindsight, looks like the hilarious initial reaction to the new technology that is bicycles in the early 1900s. "Voices were raised in protest. Bicycles were proclaimed morally hazardous. Until now, children and youth were unable to stray very far from home on foot."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Now," one magazine warned, "15 minutes could put them miles away. Because of bicycles, it was said, young people were not spending the time they should with books and, more seriously, that suburban and country tours on bicycles were not infrequently accompanied by seductions." So I took that to read that young people are using bikes to get away from their parents so they could, I guess, have sex. Not infrequently accompanied with seduction, I guess, is what they're saying, right? "So in response to this huge trend, Wilbur and Orville opened their own small bicycle business, the Wright Cycle Exchange, selling and repairing bicycles." They eventually changed the name to the Wright Cycle Company. And it says, "The sales at the Wright Cycle Company picked up again to the point where they were selling about 150 bicycles a year, and they stayed with it." Then, the second part that I found so interesting was, "They got tired of selling other people's products and decided to sell their own. There, on the second floor, the brothers began making their own model bicycles available to order." And that was their -- so they sold a bunch of other like accessories and stuff like that, but the vast majority of their income, they were sustained on the fact they invented their own model of bicycles and started selling them directly. And then as the business grew, they hired a person to help run them. So when they were off -- remember, they're living in Dayton, Ohio at the time. They spent months in Kitty Hawk going back and forth over several years. And the months that they're gone away from Ohio, the bike shop is still running because they have somebody in charge, and they're using the profits from the bike shop to actually fund their experiments. Okay. So this is -- this next note I left myself was the importance of heroes. And I think everybody has people that inspire them, people that obviously come before and have contributed to the feel that they want to spend their time doing. Obviously, most of the books that I cover here are people that have built companies that you can learn from, some of which, I would say, are almost idolized.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

If you look like somebody like Elon Musk is, I think, the most admired entrepreneur alive right now, Jeff Bezos is up there. And then going back in history, you realize that I've talked about this whole idea where books are the original hyperlinks. You realize that Jeff Bezos looked backwards, Elon Musk looks backwards. So Jeff Bezos looked backwards to Sam Walton, and Sam Walton looked backward to J.C. Penney and all this other -- it's all basically connected. So I think it's really important to have people. And I don't mean idolize -- like I don't think you should idolize him. It's because they're all just humans. Reading these biographies, you realize they have faults just as you or I. But I do think having people you look up to is extremely important and it's motivating, at least for me, and I'm sure it's probably for you as well. So this is the importance of heroes. This is a person that really stuck in their -- again, they're reading about flight. This is where they're getting the idea, and they've had a lifelong passion for this. So this guy named Otto Lilienthal, let me just jump into this. "Wilbur had begun reading about the German glider enthusiast, Otto Lilienthal, who had recently been -- who had been killed -- who had recently been killed in an accident. Much of what he read, he read out to Orville. Over the years, Lilienthal had designed and built more than a dozen different gliders. He called them sailing machines." "As a pilot, he would hang by his arms below the wings. Lilienthal would position himself on a steep slope, the wings held above his head. He stood like an athlete waiting for the starting pistol. Then he would run down the slope and into the wind. Hanging on as the wind lifted him from the ground, he would swing his body and legs this way or that way as a means of balancing and steering and then glide as far as possible and try to land on his feet. 'It must not remain our desire only to acquire the art of the bird,' Lilienthal had written. It's our duty not to rest until we have attained a perfect scientific conception of the problem of flight."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I was at a science center with my daughter a few months ago. And I already read this book last year, and this is the first time I was introduced to Otto Lilienthal, and part of the section of the science center was dedicated to flight. And sure enough, right at the beginning was videos and pictures -- or I guess, pictures because there's no video back then, pictures of Otto Lilienthal and some of his machines. So the next thing I want to talk to you about is rereading and revisiting old ideas. So I was just telling you that I reread books, I have a conversation with my friends all time about how like specific podcast I listen to over and over again. The reason I add like time markers in the podcast I do is because you may listen to this one time and there might be an idea that sticks out to you. Well, I want to make it easy if you go back to this podcast to find it. Some of my podcasts are short, but some of them are long. So maybe you only need like a 5-minute idea or a 2-minute idea, you don't want to have to listen to the whole podcast to get that. So I do think there's a huge value in rereading and revisiting old ideas because you can read or learn something once, and then a few years past, and you wind up rereading it again and you're a different person when you're rereading it. And those ideas may have been compounded and added on to, and they might have additional value to you or maybe you have a different interpretation. So rereading, revisiting old ideas. It says, "So the news of Lilienthal's death,' Wilbur later wrote, 'aroused in him as nothing had an interest that had remained passive from childhood.' His reading on the flight of birds became intense. On the shelves of the family library was an English translation of a famous illustrative volume, Animal Mechanism written by a French physician" -- I have no idea how to pronounce this. We're going to call him Marley, "more than 30 years before. Birds were also in interest of Bishop Wright, hence, the book's presence in the house, and Wilbur had already read it. Now he read it anew."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Wilbur was drawn upon a quote from Pettigrew -- this is another author, "for years. Like the inspiring lectures of a great professor, the book had opened his eyes and started him thinking in ways he'd never had." Next thing is, "You are not too late. Sometimes you must ignore the odds. Along with Lilienthal, Chanute and Langley" -- these are all guys that came before Wright, that were studying and writing about different ideas on how humans can learn how to fly, "numbers of others among the most -- among them, the most prominent engineers, scientists and original thinkers of the 19th century had been working on the problem of controlled flight, including Sir George Cayley, Sir Hiram Maxim" -- Maxim was the inventor of the machine gun -- "Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison, none had succeeded." "Hiram Maxim had reportedly spent $100,000 of his own money on a giant steam-powered, pilotless flying machine only to see it crash and then attempting to take off." And now here's the surprising part, "In no way did any of this discourage or deter Wilbur or Orville Wright any more than the fact that they had no college education, no formal technical training, no experience working with anyone other than themselves, no friends in high places, no financial backers, no government subsidies and little money on their own are the entirely real possibility that, at some point, like Otto Lilienthal, they could be killed." That was one of the most shocking things I read because it just puts it into perspective. Imagine there's a problem that everybody in modern time, the most successful scientists, entrepreneurs, people that have almost virtually unlimited resources, governments, et cetera, are working on a problem, they can't solve it. And you have 2 guys, relatively of modest means, no formal education, no technical training, no anything, just the desire to solve this problem, wind up becoming -- solving the problem in the sense where Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, and all these other people had failed. It's actually really inspiring to me.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Let's see, this is the note I left for myself, books transformed idle curiosity into the active zeal of workers. Among -- so they wrote -- Wilbur writes to the Smithsonian saying, "Hey, I'm interested in controlled flight. Can you send me any information you have?" And they sent him a lot of books and data that have been collected. And so among the material that Smithsonian provided him was an English translation of a book titled -- okay. So the -- I don't know how to say it in France, but the translation is Empire of the Air. It was published in Paris in 1881. It had been written by a French farmer, poet and student of flight, Louis-Pierre Mouillard. "Nothing Wilbur had yet read so affected him. He would long consider it one of the most remarkable pieces of aeronautical literature ever published. For Wilbur, flight had become a cause, and Mouillard, one of the great missionaries of the cause, like a prophet crying in the wilderness, exhorting the world to repent of its unbelief in the possibility of human flight." "At the start of his Empire of Air, Mouillard gave fair warning that one could be entirely overtaken by the thought that the -- by the thought of the problem of flight." Excuse me, let me read that again. "Mouillard gave fair warning that one could be entirely overtaken by the thought that the problem of flight could be solved by man." This is a quote from Mouillard. "When once this idea had invaded the brain, it possesses it exclusively." "For Wilbur and Orville, the dream had taken hold. The works of Lilienthal and Mouillard, that the brothers attest, had infected us with their own unquenchable enthusiasm and transformed idle curiosity into the active zeal of workers."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

All right. So the first prototype, I thought was really interesting. In the final weeks of August, the brothers built a full-sized glider with 2 wings that they intended to reassemble and fly at Kitty Hawk, first as a kite, then if all went well, fly themselves. Its wingspan was 18 feet. The total cost of all necessary pieces and parts, ribs of ash, wires, and cloth to cover the wings, was not more than $15. And they actually get that thing to fly with a person. It's a human pilot at that point. It's before they built motors. This is -- I thought Wilbur Wright has a great quote on risk that I think is worth sharing with you. "The man who wishes to keep at the problem long enough to really learn anything positively must not take dangerous risks. Carelessness and overconfidence are usually more dangerous than deliberately accepted risks." Okay. So this next section, when I was reading this, what immediately popped into my mind was this video I saw in YouTube, and it's a young Jeff Bezos talking about stress. And so I'll explain it to you in one second. Let me read this part from the book. "Far from home, on their own in a way they had never been, the brothers seemed to sense, as they never had, the adventure of life. Orville would later say that even with all the adversities they had to face, it was the happiest time they had ever known." And how that relates to the Jeff Bezos opinion on stress, he was saying that stress comes from not taking action over something that you have some control over, and stress comes from ignoring things you shouldn't be ignoring. So Jeff uses the following metaphor to explain this point. "Stress doesn't come from hard work. You can be working incredibly hard and loving it. Likewise, you can be out of work and be incredibly stressed over that." So if you want to watch that video, it's like 2 minutes. I definitely think it's worth your time. I'll leave the link to the YouTube video in the show notes on your podcast player and at founderspodcast.com.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this next section is about hard work and its results. "Hard workers are greatly admired, and the Wrights were 2 of the workingest boys they had ever seen. And when they worked, they worked. They had their whole heart and soul in what they were doing. The day was clear. The wind just as wished. It was October 19." And after -- this just gives you an idea of how hard they've been working. "It was October 19, and after nearly 4 years of concentrated study and effort by the brothers, it proved a day of days. Wilbur made one man-flight after another." How many is unknown. No count was kept. He did record, however, flights of 300 to 400 feet in length and speeds on landing of nearly 30 miles an hour." So before they had any kind of measurable success, they studied and worked for 4 years on this idea. I love this idea of how they think you have -- they recommend discovering things for yourself. "It was not just that this machine -- that their machine had performed so poorly or that so much still remained to be solved, but that so many of the long-established supposedly reliable calculations and tables prepared by the likes of Lilienthal, Langley, and Chanute, data the brothers have taken as gospel" -- so if you remember, previously in the podcast, I was talking about how they had to refigure out their own ratios, this is what I was referencing. "Data that the brothers have taken as gospel had proved to be wrong and could no longer be trusted. Clearly, those esteemed authorities had been guessing, groping in the dark. The accepted tables were, in a word, worthless. We had to go ahead in discovering -- and discover everything ourselves, said Orville Wright." Their preference, even though they read a lot, they wanted to apply what they were learning, and they felt the only way you could really learn was by doing.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this is a quote on Wilbur about that. "He said that men had to learn to manage in order to fly, and there were only 2 ways. One is to get on him and learn by actual practice how each motion and trick may be best met. The other is to sit on a fence and watch the beast awhile," meaning the flying machine, "And then retire to the house and, at leisure, figure out the best way of overcoming his jumps and kicks." "The latter system is the safest, but the former, on the whole, turns out the larger proportion of good riders. 'If one were looking for perfect safety,' he said, 'one would do well to sit on the fence and watch the birds. But if you really wish to learn, you must mount a machine and become acquainted with its tricks by actual trial.'" So on several podcasts, I've introduced this section that it's, I think, present in every single biography I've read so far, and that's critics don't know s_*_. Obviously, it's me being tongue in cheek, there are some criticisms that are accurate. But what I'm saying is that even the people that are facing measurable odds or wind up such as the Wright Brothers, inventing one of the most important machines or products or tools the world's ever seen, all of them have to overcome people telling them that they don't know what they're doing and they're going to fail. So this is the Wright brothers' version of that. "Meanwhile, an article in the September issue of the popular McClure Magazine, written by Simon Newcomb, a distinguished astronomer, and professor at John Hopkins University, dismissed the dream of flight as no more than a myth. 'And were such a machine devised,' he asked, 'what useful purpose could it possibly serve?' The first successful flyer will be the handiwork of a watchmaker and will carry nothing heavier than an insect."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So here's -- this guy's a distinguished professor and astronomer, has a residency at John Hopkins University, which was looked upon as like a great institution then and I guess still now. And he's saying, "Why even waste your time trying to fly?" Like what -- he says, "What useful purpose could it possibly serve? And even if you were able to do it, it would never carry anything heavier than an insect?" I think there's just another -- to me that they just -- you got to think for yourself. And if you think something is valuable and you think you can do it, then do it because even people that other people think are smart, they may -- they just don't have the same experience. It's just one of the -- just great writing when they actually find success, and they actually fly for the first time. "Success it most certainly was and more. What had transpired that day in 1903 in the stiff winds and cold of the outer banks in less than 2 hours' time was one of the turning points in history, the beginning of change for the world far greater than any of those presents could have possibly imagined. With their homemade machine, Wilbur and Orville Wright had shown, without a doubt, that man could fly. And if the world didn't know it yet, they did." Their flights that morning were the first ever in which a piloted machine took off under its own power into the air in full flight, sailed forward with no loss of speed, and landed at a point as high as that from which it started. Being the kind of men they were, neither ever said the stunning contrast between their success and Samuel Langley's full-scale failure just days before." So let me interject there. Samuel Langley, he was -- solicited donations of tens of thousands of dollars. And again, he was one of the most revered scientists and thinkers about flight. And he was getting super successful and he had all this media attention on him.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And he just crashed over and over and over, and he never was able to actually solve -- create a piloted machine that took off under its own power. So that's who Samuel Langley is in the story. So it says, "Samuel Langley's full-scale failure just days before made what they had done in their own all the more remarkable. Not incidentally" -- this is the part I found most interesting, "The Langley project would cost nearly $70,000, the greater part of it public money, whereas the brothers' total expenses for everything from 1900 to 1903, including materials and travel to and from Kitty Hawk, came to a little less than $1,000, a sum paid entirely from the modest profits of their bicycle business." That just puts a smile on my face, the idea that somebody with all the resources in the world was outmaneuvered and failed in a spot where 2 very determined brothers were able to succeed with 1/70th of the resources. This next note is onward. I think this is just -- like a good aphorism, good quote for life. "They were always thinking of the next thing to do. They didn't waste much time worrying about the past." Here's some interesting parts, the probability of flying machines. So like every podcast, I'm just skipping ahead. This is not meant to be a summary. So I'm just pulling out things that were interesting to me. So at this point, this is later in the book, they have successfully now created a bunch of different flying machines that are flying longer and higher than they ever have, and they're starting the business. So they wind up doing a deal with these wealthy people in France, and they're going to sell them a plane for -- flying machine for $200,000. So this is the profitability of flying machines.

"Meantime, a sum of $5,000 was to be deposited in a New York bank in escrow. $200,000 was an exceedingly large sum, and the $5,000 the brothers were to receive, however the further negotiations went" -- so basically they keep that $5,000 no matter what happens -- "would more than cover all the expenses they had since first going to Kitty Hawk." They were extremely frugal. Focus, this is the next note I have for myself, is focus. "Neither the inpatients of waiting crowds nor the sneers of rivals nor the pressure of financial conditions, not always easy, could induce him to hurry" -- this is Wilbur Wright talking about -- "could induce him to hurry over any difficulty before he had done everything in his power to understand and overcome it." What I found really interesting is the distribution channel of flying machines. So you make this huge invention, how are you going to sell this thing, right? So what they figured out was when you do something new -- this part kind of reminds me of what Elon did with SpaceX and Tesla recently, where you got -- I'm sure I'm not alone, but there's probably millions of people watching SpaceX flights. The media covers it all the time because we've never seen a private company been able to take -- have a rocket take off and land. And so basically doing something brand new is going to get you media attention, right? And then he capitalizes on that by sending like his Tesla Roadster into space, and that gets him, what, hundreds of millions of dollars of free advertising. Who knows what the actual dollar amount is? So they built something that no one's ever seen. It's powered controlled flight. And so they do these huge demonstrations all over the world, where hundreds of thousands of people show up to watch. So the media covers it because they think it's crazy, and then people are attracted because the media covers it and it becomes like a show. And then what happens is now there's way more people that are aware that these flying machines exist, and the orders just roll in.

So here's a little part of that. "In the days that follow, Orville provided" -- they're both doing demonstrations. Orville is in the United States and Wilbur is flying in Europe at the time. "In days that followed, Orville provided one sensational performance after another, breaking one world record after another. As never before, the 2 "bicycle mechanics," as they were referenced, some people referred to them as, "and their flying machines were causing simultaneous sensations on both sides of the Atlantic. They had become a transcontinental touring circus." "10,000 people would be in the crowd for these demonstrations. Over 200,000 people came to watch Wilbur fly in 6 months in France alone. And a short time later, 200,000 people showed up to one demonstration in Berlin." And this is Wilbur Wright on making the case for micromanaging. When he was doing these flights in Europe, he would ship the flyer in boxes and then had to reassemble and do everything himself. He wouldn't even let -- I think he was at Le Mans and this other airfield in France, too, where they had mechanics, people standing by, he wouldn't even let them put oil in it. And then after -- while he's in Europe, his brother is somewhere in the Washington D.C. area, and he winds up almost dying. And he has a passenger actually die. They nosedive from 150 feet. And so Wilbur Wright is talking about how he was criticized all for micromanaging that they called him like old oil can because he wouldn't even let you touch his oil can. And so here's his -- like basically what he felt -- why he felt he was right. "People think I'm foolish because I do not like the men to do the least important work on the machine. They say I crawl under the machine when men could do those things well enough. I do it partly because it gives me opportunity to see if anything in the neighborhood is out of order." So what happened to his brother was the -- one of the propellers fell off."

And Wilbur is like, "Well, if I was there, that wouldn't have happened," because we would have checked and he was methodical over and over again of checking the machine. He didn't care if there's 20,000 people outside waiting. If something is wrong, he just wouldn't fly. And this is Wilbur Wright on the idea of flight. "In the enthusiasm being shown around me, I see not merely an outburst intended to glorify a person but a tribute to an idea that has always impassioned mankind. I sometimes think that the desire to fly after the fashion of birds is an ideal handed down to us, by our ancestors, who in their grueling travels across trackless lands in prehistoric times, looked enviously on the bird soaring freely through space at full speed above all obstacles on the infinite highway of the air." I just included that because I thought it was beautiful language. And here's where -- I'm going to close on 2 paragraphs that just brought a smile to my face that I thought were heartwarming or inspiring, for lack of a better word. And well, let's just jump into it. "Of the immediate family, only Bishop Wright had yet to fly." Remember, Bishop Wright is their father. "Nor had anyone of his age ever flown anywhere on Earth. He had been with the brothers from the start, helping in every way he could, never losing faith in them or their aspirations. Now at 82, with the crowd cheering, he walked out to the starting point, where Orville, without hesitation, asked him to climb aboard. They took off soaring over Huffman Prairie at about 350 feet for a good 6 minutes, during which Bishop's only words were, 'Higher, Orville, higher.'"

And I just think having a child and just imagine how proud you'd be of what your child is able accomplish. And then being 82, being in a plane for the first time and just saying higher, Orville, higher, I don't know, that just -- that makes me smile. Okay. And then this last sentence was amazing. "On July 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong, another American born and raised in Western Ohio, stepped on to the moon, he carried with him in tribute to the Wright Brothers a small swatch of the muslin from a wing of their 1903 flyer."

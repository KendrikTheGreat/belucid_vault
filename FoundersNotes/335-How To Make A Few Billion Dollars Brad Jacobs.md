During my 44 years as a CEO and a serial entrepreneur, I have made every possible mistake in business. I've overpaid for acquisitions and botched integrations. I've run operations for cash when I should have invested for growth. I have delegated tasks I should have done myself. I've hired the wrong people. I made strategic bets that didn't pay off. And yet, my teams and I have managed to create tens of billions of dollars of value for our shareholders. This book is about what I've learned from my blunders and how you can replicate our successes. I'm what's called a moneymaker. I've started five companies from scratch, seven if you include two spin-offs and turn them all into 1 billion or multibillion-dollar enterprises. My teams and I have completed approximately 500 acquisitions. In total, these ventures have created hundreds of thousands of jobs and raised about $30 billion in outside capital. My career began in 1979 when I started a privately owned oil brokerage company called Amerex Oil Associates. I was 23, with just a few thousand bucks and no experience. Within four years, my partners and I had $4.7 billion in annual brokerage volume with offices worldwide. We sold Amerex in 1983, and I moved from New York to London to start an oil trading company called Hamilton Resources. Hamilton generated about $1 billion a year in revenue, and we made this money through an opportunistic combination of crude oil trading, counter trade, prefinance, and refinery processing deals. In 1989, so six years later, I moved back to the United States and entered a new sector, the rapidly expanding field of solid waste management. I called my new venture, United Waste Systems and took it public in 1992. So founded the company in 1989, takes it public in '92, is going to sell it in '97. We became the industry's fifth largest player.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And in 1997, we sold United Waste for $2.5 billion. United Waste taught me that I love working with outrageously talented people to deliver outsized returns for shareholders in public stock markets. So he sells United Waste in 1997, that same year. He says, "I started a new company, United Rentals to rent construction equipment for job sites." I took this venture public later that same year with a growth strategy that emphasized acquisitions from the start. Within 13 months, we had built the largest equipment rental company in the world. There's a hilarious story later in the book about a lunch that Brad had with the CEO of his major competitor in that industry. I'll get to it later on in the episode. Within 13 months, we had built the largest equipment rental company in the world. United Rentals stock is a 100 bagger. Their share price at inception was $3.50 and it now trades at more than 100x that price. In 2011, I was on to my next big thing, XPO Logistics. XPO was the seventh best-performing stock in the Fortune 500 of the last decade. Its main focus was freight transportation, matching truckers with shippers, forwarding freight and expediting urgent shipments. We built XPO into an integrated global logistics leader. I divided XPO into three separate publicly traded companies as a value-creation strategy. We spun off GXO, the largest contract logistics provider in the world and RXO, a freight brokerage platform that runs on technology that we developed in-house. I currently chair all three companies and each business is helmed by a strong CEO. These experiences have allowed me to share thought experiments that can help you learn to think differently, which is an essential prerequisite to accomplishing big things.

This book is a guide. If you have a burning passion to make enormous amounts of money in business or want a turbocharge your chances of success in sports, the arts, politics, philanthropy or any part of your life, read on.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

That was an excerpt from the book I'm going to talk to you about today, which is How to Make a Few Billion Dollars and it was written by Brad Jacobs. In addition to starting seven separate billion-dollar companies, Brad also listens to Founder, he sent me a very nice message saying that he was addicted to listening to these book reviews. And he was kind enough to send me an early copy of this book a few months ago, and I read it and wanted to make an episode or to release the episode rather when it's available, so you can actually order it, which I highly recommend that you do and that will be obvious as we go through some of the ideas contained in Brad's book. So I want to jump right into it. He says, I've come to know a lot of extremely successful people in my life. They all have one thing in common. They think differently than most people. All of them, to a person, have rearranged their brains to prevail at achieving big goals in turbulent environments where conventional thinking often fails. I want to read one more sentence, and I'm going to read you this quote from Peter Thiel that popped in my mind when I got to the section of the book. I love that what he said, "All of them, to a person, have rearranged their brains to prevail at achieving big goals in turbulent environments where conventional thinking often fails." Making a few billion dollars doesn't just happen, but it's possible with intense focus and a willingness to transform how you use your mind. That is the first chapter. So I got to the section immediately when I read that, one of my favorite quotes from Peter Thiel popped into my mind. And Peter said the single most powerful pattern that I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas, that idea of finding value in unexpected places and thinking from first principles instead of formulas, instead of using conventional thinking.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Remember that, later on, we're going to talk about this outrageous thing that happened. Brad winds up making about $4 billion, buying back a bunch of his stock, even though bankers and advisers around him were saying, "Hey, no one's ever done something like this before." And his response was perfect because you can tell he was thinking from first principles, he's like, "Well, just because we were the first company to buy back such a high percentage of our stock in this situation doesn't mean it's a bad idea" and it turned out to be a phenomenal idea. So I like that he starts the book with this where it's like you need to rearrange your brain to prevail at achieving big goals and turbulent environments where conventional thinking often fails. If Brad had -- another way to think about that in this situation, which we'll cover later. If Brad had listened and adhered to conventional thinking, he'd be $4 billion -- him and his company would be $4 billion poor. And so spread throughout the book, you're going to see these like boxed, stand-alone maxims or pieces of advice that relate to what he's currently trying to teach us. And they really like -- the way I think about him, he's distilling down his knowledge from that into like simple to remember maxims. And so he said, so much of success in business comes from keeping your head in a good place. He talks about the importance of expecting positive outcomes. And I think it says a lot that the first chapter of this book is called how to rearrange your brain, and he spends a lot of time on the importance of managing your mind and attitude. Entrepreneurship is difficult and stressful, requires sound judgment and you cannot make high-quality decisions if you don't manage your inner monologue, your inner feelings, and I love this idea of expecting positive outcomes. Expect positive outcomes, stop beating yourself up mentally, I have. The next time you catastrophe something that isn't that bad, understand that your reaction is a genetic survival trait that you inherited from your hunter-gatherer ancestors. The only time that I've ever felt truly lost was when I stepped down from United Rentals in 2007. So he's going to talk about -- this is really the entire section is why understanding and controlling your mind is so important for founders.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And you and I have talked about this before, and there's a great quote by Marc Andreessen that said entrepreneurs have only ever experienced two emotions, euphoria and terror and nothing you be treating. It's the highest highs and the lowest lows, so you've got to learn to control your mindset and your emotions. The only time I felt truly loss is when I stepped down from United Rentals in 2007. I started looking for my next big thing, and I couldn't find it. I became depressed. I'm an ambitious person by nature and a deal maker by inclination. Now I had no deal going, no industry sector where I could envision working my magic. And so he starts reading like a library of psychology book trying to figure out how to fix this. This is I learnt to turn my internal chatter to my advantage by reframing negative thoughts as useful data rather than objective reality, that is tied to another idea that he's going to use over and over again, something you and I have talked about over and over. It comes -- this is a fantastic quote from this legendary founder, named Henry Kaiser, who is building companies around World War II. I read his biography because Charlie Munger recommended it to me, and actually, when I went to Charlie Munger's house to have dinner with him, the book was sitting behind Charlie on the shelf, and I actually got to ask him about it. And it was incredible. Charlie hadn't read that book probably like 15 years, but his recall, it was impeccable. Like he told me -- like he essentially recited all the facts that are in that book as if he had read it yesterday. But Henry Kaiser has this great quote in that biography. That says, "Problems are just opportunities in work clothes." And so I think it's a similar analogy to what he's saying here. It's like, yes, everybody is going to have a negative internal chatter in your mind, why don't we reframe that, use those negative thoughts as useful data rather than as objective reality. Back to Brad. Inevitably, the process of running a business will test your bias towards hope or fear, euphoria or terror, the way you and I talk about this. When I noticed I'm feeling anxious about something, I ask -- this is fantastic. I ask, what's the worst that can happen and how would I cope with it? And then he's another question he asked himself, if a friend had a similar worry, how would advise them to handle it.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this idea of stepping outside of yourself, something I've tried to practice as well. Step outside of yourself, it's your problem, pretend it somebody else's problem, a friend, a loved one, even a competitor maybe. And so if I had that similar euphoria, the similar problem, and it wasn't me, how would I tell them to solve it and then just take your own advice. So he's saying putting distance between yourself personally and the source of your anxiety actually helps you think more objectively about positive outcomes. This idea, think about it. The guy has started seven separate billion-dollar companies. And the first chapter of the book is all about the importance of managing your mind and attitude. So he says not beating myself up has been a hard-learned lesson for me. I've become much happier in my middle age when I stopped expecting unrealistic levels of perfection for myself and my family. I still struggle with this all the time. I beat myself up. I have a very -- I always say my inner monologue. It sounds a lot like David Goggins. If you ever heard his audio book, Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind. It sounds like, so I'm going to have to take Brad's advice here. I've become much happier in middle age, when I stopped expecting unrealistic levels of perfection from myself and my family and my friends and my coworkers, not to mention customers, vendors and shareholders. The reality is that when you're trying to make a few billion dollars, your team is likely running in multiple directions at a fast pace, except that some goof ups are inevitable, and you'll find that it's much easier to maintain your mental equilibrium as you pursue big goals. This goes over several pages, I try to summarize this for myself, so I can remember in the future, don't beat yourself up, emotions blur judgment, keep a positive mental attitude and stay calm. And one way that Brad does all of that is he's a big fan of thought experiment. The reason -- I mean, you're just -- I think it's a no-brainer to buy the book. But there's a bunch of stuff that I'm not going to cover in the pod cast, it's in here that the appendix -- I think of this as -- what I would do is like I read it straight through and then I'd keep it on a shelf or keeping it on a desk and then use it as a reference. And you'll go back and there's a bunch of things like, all the chapters are separate things, so like how to run great meetings, how to do a lot of M&A without imploding your company, how to build an outrageously talented team.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I really do think this is a fantastic reference, I should say, close at hand. And so one of the things he has in this book is a bunch of thought experiments that he uses. So I just want to outline why those things are so important to him. He says Albert Einstein was a consummate daydreamer. And then he preferred the term. It's German. I'm not even going to try to pronounce it. But just daydreaming, thought experiments. So he says thought experiments are not limited to genius scientists, gifted artists, composers, mathematicians, all use them for creative work or problem solving. I usually spend about half an hour a day meditating, much of this time is spent in thought experiments. This produces a profound sense of calmness and is when many of my best decisions materialize. I can't remember if I've already said this, but Brad was kind enough to invite me to hit the book launch party they had in New York. I flew up to New York just for like 16 hours, just to go to the book launch and meet Brad. What was fascinating, and I had this inclination, is like he's just got great energy. He's got a great -- I hate to say, but I have another way to say, there's just a great personal vibe when you're like in-person with him. And I talked to people that work for him, they said the same thing. They like love him. They enjoy like the work environment that he's created and the best source I know to experience like how Brad is, is I would listen to the Invest Like the Best episode that Brad, David with my friend, Patrick. It's Episode 352 of Invest Like the Best. And Brad, in that interview talks a lot about the importance of meditating. He's been meditating, I think, for over 50 years. And as he says right here in the book, he feels it's been a huge benefit to his career because that's where he feels many of his best decisions actually materialize. So let's go to this what I mentioned earlier, that businesses problems. Companies as Problem Solving Machines

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This comes up over and over again, that businesses problems and great companies, the way I think about it is great companies are just effective problem-solving machines. And I first heard that idea or that Idea was planted into my mind maybe seven years ago when I read Danny Meyer, the famous restauranteur, his autobiography, and Brad is going to talk about his most important business mentor and the lesson that he taught Brad when Brad was in his 20s. I've had multiple business mentors over the years, but none have been more important than Ludwig Jesselson. Mr. Jesselson ran the largest commodity trading company in the world. I got to know him on my 20s, when his company was a client of my oil brokerage business. Before long, we were having lunch regularly and he would share bits of business wisdom that have stayed with me ever since. At one memorable lunch, I arrived burdened -- remember Brad in his 20s at this point, okay? At one lunch I arrived burdened with problems that I began to unload on him. Mr. Jesselson listened carefully and waited until I had finished speaking, then he put down his fork, turned to me and said, "Look, Brad, if you want to make money in the business world, you need to get used to problems because that's what business is. It's actually about finding problems, embracing and even enjoying them because each problem is an opportunity to remove an obstacle and get closer to success." I'm going to put this book down. And I'm going to go to where I have my highlights stored from Danny Meyer's book, which is called, Setting the Table. It's in -- if you have access to Founders Notes, I highly recommend going -- searching for Setting the Table and then reading all of them, takes less than 10 minutes and it gives you a good overview of a reminder of the lessons that Danny Meyer was trying to teach you and I from his book, but he had a very similar experience. I'm pretty sure he was in his 20s at the time as well. He's having dinner with another older, more successful entrepreneur at the time, this guy named Stanley Marcus of the Neiman Marcus family. And it's remarkable. It's very -- almost dead on with what's happening with Brad when he was in the 20s, when he's talking to Mr. Jesselson. And so Danny Meyer is kind of unloading his problems and his stresses to an older, wiser entrepreneur because opening this new restaurant might be the worst mistake I've ever made.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Stanley set his Martini down. Looked me in the eye and said, so -- this is one of my favorite quotes I've ever read in any book. So you made a mistake. You need to understand something important and listen to me carefully. The road to success is paved with mistakes well handled. His words remained with me through the night. I repeated them over and over to myself and it led to a turning point in the way I approached business. Stanley's lesson, reminding me of something my grandfather, Irving Harris, who is a famous -- or not famous, a successful entrepreneur as well. Stanley's lesson reminded me of something grandfather, Irving Harris, had always told me the definition of business' problems was exactly what Mr. Jesselson is telling a young Brad Jacobs. The definition of businesses' problems, his philosophy came down to a simple fact of business life. Success lies not in the elimination of problems, but in the art of creative, profitable problem solving. That's an excellent line too. Success lies not in the elimination of problems, but in the art of creative, profitable problem solving. The best companies are those that distinguish themselves by solving problems most effectively, the way the maximum I distill that down, so I could remember myself is that business is problems and great companies are just effective problem-solving machines as we're going to see, we'll continue on this page. They get -- a lot of the best entrepreneurs, they would get excited. They would get excited when they found businesses -- problems in their businesses. And so Brad continues what he learned from this lunch with Mr. Jesselson. In that moment, I learned something invaluable. Problems are an asset, not something to avoid, but something to run towards. Big ambitions -- that's so excellent, not something to avoid but something to run towards. Let me interrupt. Let me interrupt, because when I got to this part, again, just popped right to my mind, I wrote down, Jeff Bezos, Henry Kaiser.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I already told you Henry-Kiser loved problems. He said problems with just opportunities in work clothes. Jeff Bezos, multiple books in the Everything Store, the first biography of Jeff Bezos, written by Brad Stone, there's interaction between Jeff and one of his employees. And he tells them like some bad news, something like they need to improve on or whatever. And he goes, I brought him very bad news about our business. And for some reason, he got excited. Is that not exactly what Brad Jacobs is saying. Problems are an asset, not something to avoid, but something to run towards, later on in I think this was in Jeff's -- one of Jeff Bezos' shareholder letters, but he said that he finds waste, very exciting. So he says the customer experience path that we've chosen requires us to have an efficient cost structure. This is Jeff Bezos writing, by the way. The good news for shareholders is that we see much opportunity for improvement in that regard. Everywhere we look, we find what experienced Japanese manufacturers would call muda, translates into waste, what experienced manufacturers would call waste. I find this incredibly energizing. I see it as potential years and years of variable and fixed productivity gains and more efficient, higher velocity and more flexible capital expenditures. That is from the book Invent and Wander, highly recommended. I've done, I think, two podcasts on that already. It's all Jeff Bezos' shareholders letters and then transcripts of like his best speeches. But I love -- I've a reference of that book all the time. It's exactly what Jeff was talking about there is like, "Oh, I get excited, oh, this is a waste, good." This is incredibly energizing its potential years and years and years of improvements in our business, very similar to what Brad Jacobs was telling us here. Big ambitions often to get even bigger problems. If your initial reaction to a major setback is overwhelming frustration, that is counterproductive. Instead, do this, great. This is an opportunity for me to create a lot of value. Is that not the exact same idea that Bezos just told us in his shareholder letters. it's the same thing. It's exactly the same. Great. This is an opportunity for me to create a lot of value. If you can figure out how to solve this problem -- excuse me, if I can figure out how to solve this problem, I'll be much closer to my goal.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

In the four decades, since that launch with Mr. Jesselson, I've dealt with nearly every problem you can imagine, challenges with acquisitions, people, tech, branding, you name it. I am not surprised when things don't go perfectly. That's the nature of this universe. The big, gunky problems can be where the best opportunities lie. So reminded me of when I got to talk to Charlie Munger, he said the same thing. And you notice this in his last -- I think the last published interview he did or one of the last ones, which was John Collison, the founder of Stripe interviewed him. It's actually published on the Invest Like the Best feed, too. It's also obvious like after spending a few hours talking to him. When I got back to my hotel, then I had like this -- I immediately just put all -- like everything we talked about because I didn't look at my phone one time when I was with him, I was like, "Man, this is once-in-a-lifetime experience. I want to document this, I want to remember this." And one of the things that I wrote was that Charlie had a complete -- almost a complete indifference to problems. He said they should be expected, you should toughen up like you just essentially like s_*_ up and cope when you have problems that come your way and then you should be wise enough to try to prevent any other problems. But this idea, it's like very similar to what he's saying. I'm not surprised when things don't go perfectly. It's impossible. He's been a CEO and entrepreneur for 44 years. He don't think he's running to every single problem like, of course, that's what makes the book so valuable. I think I saw it selling for like $27. It's absurd. This's absurd amount of value that you get. You get almost half a century wisdom distilled down. At his book launch party, he said this, he's like, "I don't have another book in me. I'm not writing another book. I gave you all my ideas, buy it if you want it." But I just think it's incredible how -- everything I'm talking about, this is 3, 4 pages. And we see similarities in the way Brad thinks, that Danny Meyer thought, that the guy from Neiman Marcus thought, that Jeff Bezos thought, that Henry Kaiser thought, that Charlie Munger thought. I just love. It excites me when all these ideas connect, very, very fascinating.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Moving on, this is great -- he's got these great stories spread throughout the book. And this is how to lose $500 million. So I want to go back -- actually, before I get to how to lose $500 million, he's got a very unique acknowledgment section. I read -- I have to confess that I read a lot of the acknowledgment sections in the books that I read. They're usually boring in like kind of like filler. Every once in a while, you'll find like an interesting source or an interesting book or something. What Brad did was, he put it at the front of the book, which is unusual. And then what he did is like he just made his acknowledgment section, a list of maxims that he learned from other people. You have all these conversations and you distill down one of the main ideas. And it's like -- he learned this from Michael Moretz, small amounts of capital can generate gigantic returns from Ludwig Jesselson, who we just saw, get the major trend rate, which we'll go into, dare to do new things, see the world for what it is, not where you wish it to be is one of the maxims in the acknowledgment section. I'm glad I read that before I got to this story about how to lose $500 million because see the world for what it is and not what you wish it to be is exactly what Brad did. And so he says, he calls as radical acceptance. Radical acceptance quiets the noise created by yesterday's decisions and today's wishful thinking. Here's a story about radically accepting a $500 million loss. So in the late 1990s, Congress came up with this new law called, the TEA-21, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st century. In theory, this is what Brad thought was going to happen. This legislation was going to allocate about $600 billion to rebuild the nation's infrastructure. So I was like, okay, there's going to be a bunch of all this funding up for grabs. I started scooping big road rental companies, the ones that provide barricades, cones, striping and the like. Then I waited for the market to come to me. But that never happened.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Only about 1/3 of the allocated government funding was spent, and that was spent in a little bit over time. My decision turned out to be a huge mistake and there was no point in compounding it. We ended up selling those road rental companies at about $0.5 billion loss because it was the best way forward under those circumstances. So this idea of see the world for what it is, not what you wish it to be. He's like, "Oh, this is going to be great. They're going to spend out -- dole out the $600 billion." When that didn't happen, he didn't hold on to it. What is it called? Radical acceptance quiets the noise created by yesterday's decisions and today's wishful thinking. No reason to compound this loss, let's cut our losses and move on. The next story I want to tell you about is how to keep your head and make $4 billion. That was my summary of what's about to happen. So at the time, he's running XPO, which is his third public company, I think this is in 2018, and they got hit with a short report. And so the short report gets picked up by the media saying, there's all kinds of problems with XPO, you should sell stock, everything else. And so this is the story from Brad. The short report was packed with a lot of ballooning. But of course, the market acted first and analyzed later, and our stock price went into free fall down 20% -- or 26% in one day. His response was fascinating. We did exactly what I've been describing in this chapter. We concentrated on the situation at hand without judging what had happened to us. We spent hours going over the short report page by page, identifying the many places where their data had been twisted. And so he takes a problem and he spots an opportunity, which is what he's been talking about, right? The short seller crisis had made our stock extremely cheap. And instead of fixating on that as bad, we focused on achieving a good outcome. From that perspective, the share price was manna from heaven, and we decided to buy back $2 billion worth of stock. So this is what I mentioned earlier, where the bankers are like, "$2 billion, it's way too high, you can't do that. So it's too high a percentage of your market cap. No one's ever done something like that."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And Brad is like, "Who cares?" Just because we were the first company to buy back such a high percentage of our stock. Remember, it goes from the opening. It's like you have -- you can't rest on conventional wisdom, is the way Brad put it, you have to rearrange your brain. The way Peter Thiel says is, "Hey, successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do so by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas." There is no formula for the situation that Brad's dealing with or if there was, they'd be like, oh, buy -- a little bit, buy like $100 million back, but you can't buy $2 billion where you nut, just because we were the first company to buy back such a high percentage of our stock, any similar situation. I didn't mean it was about a day. In fact, it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. A couple of years later, those $2 billion of share we bought back ended up being worth $6 billion, giving them a profit on that one transaction of $4 billion. Brad's Research Process for New Companies Okay. Moving on. This might be my favorite section in the entire book. I love how he describes all the research he does before he jumps into an industry, and it's this idea that he gets. He says one of the most valuable pieces of advice I received from my mentor, Mr. Jesselson, is you can mess up a lot of things in business and still do well as long as you get the big trend right. I make sure I understand the major trends that could threaten the business or help it sore. I'm obsessive when learning about an industry, this part -- this entire -- I'd read the entire chapter. I'm going to go over the parts that are obviously most interesting to me, but it's another illustration of this idea that you and I speak about over and over again, you see in the books, and it came from David Ogilvy, and he says, the good ones know more. They just do more research, they read more. They talk to more people. They just know more about what they're doing. The good ones know more. And so his idea is like one of the main themes with the megatrend is that technology is the dominant megatrend in our universe, if you want to make a lot of money in almost any industry, plan to invest heavily in tech. And that idea is as true today as it was a couple of hundred years ago.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I remember reading Andrew Carnegie's autobiography many years ago, I don't know, maybe four years ago. And he's talking about building businesses in 1800s. And he was talking about building Carnegie Steel at the time. And I had summarized the advice he was giving in that book, specifically around technology as this, and this comes up in the books a lot. Invest in technology, the savings compound, it gives you an advantage over slowly moving competitors and can be the difference between a profit and a loss. That is from -- that's a summary of Andrew Carnegie's ideas, which I think, Brad, based on the chapter would definitely agree with. If you want to make a lot of money in almost any industry, plan to invest heavily in tech. So this is how he starts doing research before he starts a new company. I start by reading everything I can get my hands on, journals, periodicals, newspapers, trade publications, employee reviews on web-based recruiting sites, you name it. I look at all the websites and social media of the major players and the up and comers in the industry. I watch lots of interviews with the CEOs. I use paid services like Bloomberg, AlphaSense and Thomas Reuters. I look at analysis from sell-side and buy-side analysts and I searched this SEC database, which has large amounts of information on every publicly traded U.S. company, including IPO documents, financial reports and proxies. I scope out the most valuable industry conferences, and I attend them. He goes to sell-side conferences because there are an opportunity to meet management teams face-to-face and hear the questions investors are asking. Trade associations have a wealth of industry data. I interview experts. I seek out people who live and breathe the industry that I'm considering. This phase of the research is about getting face-to-face and listening intently. I love talking to CEOs. In addition to CEOs, I seek out investment bankers who are most active in the industry and who know it deeply. Just look at how much work and how much information he's collected, right? It keeps going. So he says, in addition to CEOs, I seek out investment bankers who are most active in the industry and who know it deeply. I also talk to venture capital firms because they spend a lot of time looking at the big trends in different industries.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I tap buy-side institutions and successful fund managers who have battle scars from investing in that industry. Industry vendors, keeps going. Industry vendors are also a good source. They have a sense of the trends that could drive changes in the market and finally -- or not finally, there's two more. Shareholder activists often have important insights as well, and I reach out to journalists who know the industry because by nature, they're a skeptical bunch, and I want to hear their perspectives. So then what he'll do is he runs through like short descriptions of how to get the major trend right in a bunch of the -- how he did in a bunch of the businesses that he started, and this goes over 40 years. What's interesting is the first one. So he talks about Amerex and Hamilton Resources, and it's about like his time in the oil industry. It reminded me of a very important idea that I think that you see apply to a bunch of different industries. This idea that you can identify a market with valuable but hard to get data. And my favorite application of this, because it's just so nuts, was the episode I did on the billionaire art dealer, Larry Gagosian, Episode 325, if you haven't listened to that episode, it was fascinating, because that's exactly what he did. He identified a market with valuable but hard to get data and then essentially made like a personal treasure map that his entire business rest upon. So that came to mind when I was reading this section. A little bit of luck put me in the oil industry in 1979, when I started my oil brokerage company, Amerex. It was a highly profitable business, and my realization was that a big trend was forming around the need to capture and share information more quickly. Remember, this is in 1979, pre-Internet. This whole section is nuts. So he says that was a trend that transformed the industry in the late 1980s. We made a lot of money by being the first oil broker to get ahead of the trend. At the time, there's no Internet, no e-mail, no centralized databases with easy global access. So this is going to blow your mind.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The main source of information about the price of oil was a newsletter that came in the mail and so he talks about, he's like, "Listen, we're making verbal handshakes with clients in Europe and Asia for $50 million and $75 million over the phone with nothing on paper for days." And so this next sentence is a description of the problem. The lack of timely information was a big problem for oil brokers. We made our money by matching buyers and sellers and taking a commission just like Larry Gagosian. I could see that there was isolated pockets of valuable oil pricing data trapped all over the globe. And I knew that if we could figure out a better way to share that information, we can unlock a lot of value. And so there's no off-the-shelf solution. So he builds his own. I think this is something he does multiple times. And he says, essentially, they built like their own crude version of the Internet, but it allowed us to do something revolutionary. Every time an Amerex employee learns something useful about a buyer or seller activity or the price of oil, they entered it into our database, then we could share that information much more quickly with our brokers around the globe. That process took hours, not days, which was close to instantaneous back then in the '70s and '80s. So something took days, now takes hours. We had created a way to obtain objective insights into global oil supply and demand and pricing trends. And then here are the trends that he identified when he set up United Waste Systems, the Red Bull episode that I did, Episode 333, I think, it's pretty wild that, that business is going to make him -- its net worth is somewhere between like $20 billion and $40 billion. He was paying himself before he died somewhere between $500 and $800 million a year. He identified the opportunity from reading a magazine article. And like, hey, the richest guy in Japan, I think, is the country, makes these like energy tonics because there was no energy drink in the market at the time. That's interesting and that reading the article changed his life forever. Dietrich Mateschitz, I think is how you say his name. But we see Brad Jacobs coming up with an idea, too, is he was like, well, the idea from United Waste Systems, this is fascinating. I remember vividly the moment the industry caught my attention.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

In 1989, I was reading Merrill Lynch research reports in bed on a lazy Sunday morning. I love that and came across a report written by the top-ranked analyst for Environmental Services then. The two largest companies in the waste industry at that time were each making about $0.5 billion a year in profit. Remember, that's why I brought up the Red Bull guy. He's like, "What?" This guy is paying the most -- he's making the most money in this entire country and he sells energy tonics? And then Brad sat in and bed reading research reports, right? And he's like, wait a minute, these guys are making $0.5 billion a year in profit in 1989. And I thought how hard can it be to have trucks pick up trash, deposit in a safe place and then sent out an invoice. I wanted to know more, and so he identifies the two big trends at the time. Landfill capacity was becoming precious because regulations were pushing small trash dumps out of business. So that's trend number one. Trend number two, integration of hauling and disposal. This created an opportunity for end-to-end consolidation. I look for a way to capitalize on both trends and found a tech-based truck routing, so think about the entire oil industry kind of operating blind, waiting for this letter in the mail down the prices. He sees a very similar trend -- problem in the waste management business. Mom-and-pop owners are running trash collection companies by the seat of their pants and making money at it. Few companies were planning their truck routes methodically, much less using technology to do it. I think he says they use like a map and like pushpins. So this is ridiculous. They did not focus on optimizing routes. And so he starts optimizing routes and this is the result, instead of sending 50 trucks out over five days to pick up X tons of waste, 20 trucks, so less than half could now perform the same service in three days. So instead of 50 trucks in five days, he's doing the same work with 20 trucks in three days. Our costs kept coming down as our processes improved and our profit margin grew significantly. That is the company that he sells for $2.5 billion.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Then he talks about where he gets his idea for his other company, United Rentals. I was looking to roll up another industry. And so I set up half day meetings with nine different groups of bankers and analysts at Merrill Lynch. One of those analysts asked if I thought about going into the construction equipment rental. So that's how he finds the idea for his next billion-dollar company. And even though it's a different industry, he sees the same problem. This is the part that I texted to a bunch of friends, because I absolutely love. While the rental industry overall was slow to computerized, the larger regional players were more tech savvy. By 1997, nearly all of them were running on software developed by a company called Win Systems. This is how to get God Mode -- whatever it to myself. When I was a kid, we played a lot of video games and you'd use like cheat codes, like Game Genie, stuff like that. And one of the things that you were trying to unlock is something that was referred to as God Mode a lot, which essentially gives you like omnipresent like view of the entire world and like what you want to do. You can think of what's happening here, this idea what I absolutely love that he did. He gets omnipresent data of his entire industry. It's almost like operating in God Mode in video games when I was a kid. By 1987, nearly all of them, all the larger players in this industry is in now, right? We're running on software developed by a company called Win Systems. This told me that software was capable of managing hundreds of thousands of pieces of equipment flowing on and off job sites because they buy construction equipment and then they rent them out, it's a very straightforward business. So what does he do? I bought Win Systems. He bought the software that all of the main players were using. Owning Win accomplished two things. One, we had an industry-best platform that we can continue to develop internally for our own use, and the acquisition gave us access to aggregated anonymized data on macrotrends across the industry.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This gave us a high-level view of emerging market trends, such as equipment gluts or shortages in the making. What is buying the software company allowed him to do? We could now proactively adjust our pricing and asset management, while the rest of the industry was being reactive. I'm going to repeat that, that is so important, we could proactively adjust our pricing and asset management, while the rest of the industry, the rest of our competitors was being reactive. Okay. So then I love this story that comes from the chapter on how to do lots of high-quality M&A without imploding. And it reminds me one of my favorite sayings that I bring up a lot, that opportunity is a strange beast that frequently appears after a loss, what can appear to be a terrible thing, actually ends up being a blessing in disguise. And so he gives us some advice. He says, be sure to cover your flank. It's the stuff that comes out of left field that can take a deal down. In 2007, I sold United Rentals to the private equity firm Cerberus, no way I'm pronouncing that, right? So this private equity firm buys it for $7 billion or at least that's what Brad thought happened, highly satisfied that I just sold the company, I stepped down as Chairman and wandered off to my private investment firm to begin planning my next venture. Then the great financial crisis arrived. I remember, this is 2007, great financial crisis arrives, private equity firms began welching on deals and Cerberus defaulted on the United Rentals agreement. As a result, our stock plunged 31% in 24 hours. Over the course of the following year, the stock fell to $5. We collected a $100 million breakup fee, decided not to seek another buyer and eventually got things righted. Today, the market cap of United Rentals is $38 billion. So tried to sell it, thought they sold it for $7 billion in 2007. Fast-forward what, 15 years, something like that. Good thing they did not sell it for $7 billion because the market cap is now $31 billion higher. Dealing with Talent

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The deals I've avoided have contributed more to my success than the deals I've done. And I love this advice. He talks about the importance of setting up feedback loops. This is something that Brad is going to have in common with just the ones that come to the top of my mind, Les Schwab, Sam Walton of Walmart and Jim Casey of UPS. They all prioritized this. And what is this? It's getting data from frontline employees. They want data from the people that are actually interacting with the customers. They all talk about it in their biographies and autobiographies over and over again. So he says, when we buy a company, we discovered that the frontline employees, middle managers and even some senior executives have never been asked, what would you do to improve the company. And this is insane. You would think that the owners would want to know that. And so what Les Schwab, Sam Walton and Jim Casey would say about this, and Jim Casey's case, anytime he was driving his UPS truck, he'd pull over or have his driver pull over, and he talked to them. He wanted to know what's actually happening. They all say it differently, but the idea behind is the same. They're like, your executives, the team you have around you like, over time, they start to like filter information too much, and they can give you like an overly rosy or like false like a positive view of what's actually happening in your company and so the way you penetrate that. Oh, Bezos did this, too, I just remember, he would work -- he has everybody in Amazon, including himself, would work customer service, like in the call centers and actually answer calls directly from customers. So anyways, your executives and the people around you over time tend to give you like an overly like optimistic view of your company. And so one way to cut through that is like Sam Walton would go in stores and he talks to people, the cashiers. he talks to the people at the front door. He talks to the people unloading the trucks, like tell me what the hell is going on in this company. I want to know this. Like what would you do to improve the company?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Why are you not asking them that? Of course, you should ask them that. To them, it was very obvious, like almost -- what I realized, too, is like almost at the end of the book, he has another -- he has two questions that I thought were genius that I want to add in this section, too, because I think it ties to what he's saying here. And so what he would do, it doesn't have to just be a company acquiring, it could be in your existing company. So he asks -- I love these questions. He asked 2 questions. What's your single best idea to improve our company? What is your single best idea to improve our company? And what's the stupidest thing we're doing as a company? And so he would send that out company-wide, send an e-mail. He would probably just send this an e-mail one at a time to everyone in company. Responding back to his e-mail. What is your single best idea to improve our company? And I think of all the interesting data and ideas that you could get. And then what's a stupidest thing we're doing as a company? I love this. I love these questions for business, and then I was actually thinking, it's actually good for a family, too. Like I've talked about this before, where I'm obsessed with what I'm doing. I work seven days a week. If you're listening to this, you're highly likely you're an obsessive person as well. And yet I don't want -- I'm also a dad. So like I'm not going to be a s_*_ dad, like this is just not an option for me. And so -- it sounds weird that this came to mind, my son's too young for this, but my daughter is not. And so like I solicit feedback from her. I think I've told you this before, but I would literally go. I'm not like -- I was just like, "Hey, like how am I doing as a dad?" And I ask questions like this like, what's -- like when do I feel, who told me to do this? Like I asked her, and I'll text her this too, because she's old enough to text, which is funny. Like what do I do that makes you feel the most special? Like what don't you like that I'm doing or like just how I'm doing? But this idea is almost basically like I think it's good to be in the business, but also the idea is like what's your single best idea to improve our family is another way to think about that, right, instead of what's your single best idea to improve our company.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

What's the stupidest thing that we're doing as a family? What's the stupidest thing that I'm doing as a dad? What's your single best idea to improve what I'm doing as your father? I love the simplicity of it. And I love the idea of like sending it out, because you could bury the problem is, like what I like about the idea of sending it out like an individual question, right, just cut rates is the simplicity as opposed to putting it in maybe like a survey where there's like 10 or 12 other questions there. I think those questions are so powerful that they're good enough to stand on their own. So I absolutely love that idea. And again, so it's the feedback from -- this is just good intel. Like why wouldn't you do that? So one thing that pops up over and over again that's really important is you just -- it's like I have so many notes in the book, it's like, damn, this guy is moving fast. And I'm like, there's speed. Oh, there's more speed. It just happens over and over again. And so I mentioned this earlier, is hilarious story, where his main competitor, the CEO of Hertz, which was the largest -- not only do they have the like rental car company, but they're -- at the time, they were the largest equipment rental chain in the country as well. And Brad has his great line here. He's like, yes, Hertz did this, and they built up a national equipment rental chain to about $1 billion of annual revenue over the course of 37 years. United Rentals did that in 13 months. And so he gets his invitation, come have lunch with the CEO. He's like, "Oh, maybe he's like trying to buy me out, like what's happening. Let's just -- let me go over to see what's up." And he was ridiculous. And the note of myself was a losing strategy. Take your competitor out to lunch and ask him to slow down. And essentially, that's what he did. He's like, you may be changed one of my taglines, I had the largest car rental company and the largest equipment rental company in the world. And now I've got the largest car rental company and the second largest equipment rental company. I don't want to be second in anything. And he's telling them to slow down. You're making a mess of this industry, you're going too fast, you're going to mess this up and fast forward several years, and their -- United Rentals is making like 6x the amount of money. So that is a losing strategy. Do not take your competitor out to lunch and tell, please slow down. Please be nicer to me.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

No, foot on the gas and foot on their neck. I want to go back to the maxims that are in the acknowledgment because the thing about maxims is they're not hard rules and you need to know when to break the rules. And so he has this idea that you should lose perfectionism. And so -- but there's one domain where you don't want to actually lose perfectionism and that is in hiring. The most important thing a CEO does is recruit great people. Yes, I made the point that aiming for perfection can be counterproductive. Good is usually good enough. But if you're going to break that rule, you break it for people, make your hiring choices as perfect as they can be because there are a few mistakes costlier than hiring the wrong person. This is so good, a way to remember this. An empty seat is less damaging than a poor fit, make your hiring choices as perfect as they can be because there are few mistakes costlier than hiring the wrong person. An empty seat is less damaging than a poor fit. This entire section is about the difference between super talented people and what they bring to your company. So I love this. I'm going to read -- Steve Jobs was asked one time. What talent do you think you consistently brought to Apple? This is his answer. This was his answer rather. And I'm going to read you first because I think it sets up what Brad is trying to teach us right here. He says, "I think I've consistently figured out who the really smart people were to hang around with. You must find extraordinary people." The key observation is that in most things in life, the dynamic range between the average quality and best quality is at most 2:1, pick anything. It's going to be basically 2:1, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But in the field that I was interested in, I noticed that the dynamic range between what an average person could accomplish and what the best person could accomplish was 50:1 or 100:1, given that you're well advised to go after the cream of the cream, you can build a team that pursues the A+ players. A small team of A players can run circles around a giant team of B and C players. So then he's going to talk about how to build outrageously talented team and what he feels is most valuable member. Steve just said, "Hey, I think one of the best things I did was I figured out who the really smart people were, hang around them, try to hire them and built incredibly outrageously talented teams." Brad said, screening for superior intelligence eliminates 90% of all candidates. So that's the first thing I look for. There's just no substitute for smarts. There's no substitute for brains. The CEO trait most closely correlated with organizational success is a high IQ, doubled down on hiring the brightest. When he is interviewing people, he will ask himself, can this person think dialectically? I'm going to define that for us because I love this definition of dialectically. The ability to think dialectically is the ability to view issues from multiple perspectives and to arrive at the most economical and reasonable reconciliation of seemingly contradictory information that's so important, the ability to view issues from multiple perspectives and to arrive at the most economical and reasonable reconciliation of seemingly contradictory information. Can this person think dialectically? Are they capable of thinking from multiple perspectives and reconciling streams of information that seem to flow in different directions? And second question, are they capable of changing their opinion? Rigid thinkers at any level of intelligence are less valuable because they are mired in their own point of view. More advice. You should hire ambitious people who want to accomplish big things and make a lot of money.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

More advice, it is better to be slightly understaffed. I find that slightly understaffed teams are more focused and spend less time doing redundant busy work. Brad is big on vibes. I think he calls it the love vibe. And he says, my team and I spend a lot of time together. So it's a big deal that we like one another. An organization is like a party. You only want to invite people who bring the vibe up. And so he talks about, listen, man, I have advice for you. This is how you're going to differentiate between the A, B and C players on your team. His whole thing is like you cannot have C players ever. And when you figure out B players, it's inevitable that you're going to have some, but you can't have C players. And his whole point is that if you hire B players, they're likely to hire C players. So you got to be very careful with the B players, too. But as organization scales, you can't have all A players. It's something Steve Jobs said that Pixar, when he had 400 employees. It's the first team of all the players that he ever saw in his life, and he said, at Apple, I think that time I had 3,000 people and he's like it's possible to have a team -- have a company with 3,000 A players. So of course, you're going to have some B players, but you got to be careful because they love hiring C players and C players s_*_. This is how you differentiate between A, B and C players, and he does this in his mind, again, thought experiment. I imagine this person coming into my office and quitting without warning. Just by imagining this scenario, I can immediately tell for my own inter response whether this person is an A, B or C player. If my first out is, I was going to fire this person sooner or later, so there's no big deal, that's a C player. If my reaction is, I don't like this, but I can live with it. The transition period might be a little bumpy, but we'll find somebody else, maybe even somebody better. We are talking about a B player. But if my reaction is an internal dialogue of panic and it sounds like, "We're so screwed, how did we get into the situation. There's no way we're going to find somebody as fantastic as this person." That is an A player.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And what do you do with A players? You overpay the hell out of them. Because here's the thing. The reason you should overpay them is because -- the reason you overpay for talent is because it's nearly impossible to overpay for talent. Think about what Steve Jobs said earlier, right? In some fields, the best person is not twice as good. They're 100x as good. Think about when Steve Jobs coming back to Apple. Apple bought NeXT for almost $0.5 billion, right? The way to think about that is Apple paid $0.5 billion to rehire Steve Jobs and they got the deal of the century. It is almost impossible to overpay for talent, and Brad talks about there's a lot of things that motivate people. But you're silly if you don't think compensation. Yes, they have to believe in the mission. They have like the work to do that to find an intellectually challenging. They have to like their team. They also should be paid oodles and oodles of money. So he says there's 174,000 employees out of all the three companies that he currently chairs. Not a single one of them shows up for work because they want to make money for Brad Jacobs. They come because they want to make money for themselves and their families. Money animates people everywhere. So he's talking about this like, I have employees all over the world. This is not just a United States thing. Money animates people everywhere. That's why I've overpaid "almost every direct report I've ever had to ensure I had top team people in place." Overpay for talent. It is nearly impossible to overpay for talent. That's such an important thing to remember. Never, ever, ever forget the dynamic range of humans. It makes no financial sense to skimp on salary, incentives to save $100,000 a year when hiring a second-best candidate may cost you millions of dollars in lost profit. Oh, this guy is good. He's an A player, let me -- I can save money. I hate when people try to like -- obviously, a huge. What's the two biggest themes in the history of entrepreneurship, right? Focus and watch your costs. That's repeated over and over again by the vast majority of the people that you and I study. Watch your cost does not count when you're doing talent. That's not always like, "Oh, I have a great A player, but for the same job, I can hire a B player for $100,000 less."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

No, that's not $100,000 less. You lost millions, millions. And in Steve Jobs' case, if they didn't hire him, what did they said they didn't offer him, I think, what was it $470 -- what was that deal? $470 million, something like that? He said, no, no, it's only $200 million or whatever it is. They tried to shortchange them by a couple of hundred million, he just come back to Apple. What's -- Apple is probably out of business. Apple probably doesn't exist to this day. Never, ever, ever forget the dynamic range of human beings and overpay for talent because it's nearly impossible to overpay for talent. And then I want to close on what I feel is almost like a manifesto that it's an incredible honor and a good thing for the world to build products and services that make other people's lives better, to create jobs for hundreds of thousands of people, in Brad Jacobs case, to create wealth for your shareholders and really is a testament to the all-important entrepreneurial spirit. I love being a CEO. There's a joy in creating value and an even greater joy in knowing that so many people beyond our organization are benefiting from our accomplishments. The best way to perform our duty is to fill an unmet need in the economy with a strong business model and a responsible organization. We create a healthy workplace environment for our people, and we pay them well. We pamper our customers, and we approach challenges with practical optimism that open our minds to solutions. The great majority of the tens of billions of dollars of value that my teams and I have created have flowed outside of my companies. I am extremely proud that our company can be counted on to create value. This is only possible because we operate in free markets where creating prosperity is a virtue. I want to share a personal experience I had with a small business owner whose work ethic and customer focus echo the value system that I instill in my own companies. The small business owner, his name is Steve. Steve handles the HVAC system at my home. Steve had originally worked for the large HVAC company that had installed the system, but that company was sold, and Steve decided to set out on his own.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So again, the all-important entrepreneurial spirit. Steve is a hardworking, take pride in your work entrepreneur who puts his customers first. He cares a great deal about doing his job the way it should be done. He told me his self-esteem goes up and down with his customer satisfaction scores. Naturally, he also measures his worth by how much money he's making to support his family. There's a fair amount of criticism being voiced about profit seeking these days. Some people are embarrassed to talk about the importance of money, but Steve is totally comfortable with it. And in his pursuit of happy customers and a good living for his family, he built a successful business. As a result, customers flock to him. Steve is the face of the entrepreneurial spirit. I wrote this book with people like him in mind. People who want to work their tails off, who want to outsmart the competition, who want to put their customers on a pedestal and who want to make a lot of money for their families. The summer after eighth grade, I attended the Rhode Island Governor's School for the Gifted in Art and Music, a summer enrichment program for kids who have been nominated by their schools. I wasn't sure what to expect. On the first night, I was captivated by a speech given by one of the leaders. I remember goose bumps rising on my arms as he spoke. This program is a special opportunity, but it's up to you to take advantage of it. He said, "You have a choice. You can waste the next couple of months and not accomplish much or you can go all in. This is an opportunity to go deep on a project and do the best work that you've ever done, but you have to decide if you want it," he said. It was there that I learned what it meant to go all in, that magical connection between intensity of focus and the end result. If I put my whole heart and soul into a project, I had it in me to create really cool stuff.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

We have it in our own hands to either make life meaningful or just past time until we die. That's up to us. I hope you're inspired to run hard at making a few billion dollars or achieving some other big dream, and I wish you the exhilaration of seeing it through to success. And that is where I'll leave it, highly, highly, highly recommend buying the book. As I said before, I really do think it's a reference. I read it all the way through and then keep it closer to hands as a reference, the appendix has a bunch of thought experiments. So this is really interesting history of technology timeline because that's a huge influence in the way Brad approaches his business because of the megatrend in the universe. He's got interview questions for job candidates, recommended books, how to conduct meetings, the appendix is like full of -- you could buy the book just for the appendix, obviously read the whole thing. But anyways, if you buy the book using the link that is in the show notes, you'll be supporting the podcast at the same time. That is where am I at? 300 -- 335 books down and 1,000 to go. And I'll talk to again soon.

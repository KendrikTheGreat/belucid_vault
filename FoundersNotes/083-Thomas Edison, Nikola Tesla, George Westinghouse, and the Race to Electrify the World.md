"Great, indeed, is the power of electricity. And in the final decades of the 19th century, 3 Titans of America's Gilded Age were among the Promethean few who dreamed of the possibilities hidden in this force of nature. It's awesome power visible only in the wild rumble and slash of electrical storms." "Each Titan was determined to master this mysterious fluid, each vied to construct an empire of light and energy on a new and monumental scale. Each envisioned radiant enterprises that would straddle the globe, illuminating the night and easing forever the burden of brute labor. This is the story of the nascent years of the electric power industry and the rise of a new technology that completely transforms society, a tale told largely through 3 visionary figures, their triumphs, their blunders, and their caustic feuds."

All right, so that was an excerpt from the book that I read this week and the one I'm going to talk to you about today, which is Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World by Jill Jonnes. So this one paragraph just gives you an idea of the time that this entire story is set in. It says, "The miracle of the great Atlantic cable flashed telegrams across the coldest depths of the ocean. Where once letters from J.P. Morgan's father" -- J.P. Morgan actually plays an important role in the story. I didn't know that going into the -- before I read the book. "Once letters from J.P. Morgan's father in the London office took weeks to arrive, now telegrams pulsed through in mere minutes. The railroads had become mighty, creating new cities where there have been only marshland or prairie." "And in just the past year, they had laid an astounding 10,000 miles of track, the 1880 census" -- that's where the story begins. It's going to go all the way up until the early 1900s. "Census showed 50 million Americans. J.P. Morgan, unlike many of his old money peers, relished this new temper of the times. He admired men like Edison, who were bold, ambitious, hard-working, and confident."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So not only does J.P. Morgan play a role, which I'll talk -- expound on later on in the podcast, and financing some of these electrical companies. But he also had the first -- his house was the first private home in New York City that was lighted up and actually wired for electricity. And one of the main takeaways of this story that I was thinking about is how important it is to study like that. The electrical industry is now massive and we could not imagine living without it. But at the very beginning, things look very different. And so humans have the tendency to look at how things are now and extrapolate in the future, it's just going to be the same. And obviously, that's not the case. And so here is how individual houses were able to have electric lighting at the beginning of this industry and think about how different this experience is taking place in J.P. Morgan's house as it is in where you live since they were run by generators. So it says, "The generator had to be run by an expert engineer who came on duty at 3:00 p.m. and got up steam so that any time after 4:00 on our winter's afternoon, the lights could be turned on." Now think about that. We flip a switch. They had an actual person in the house, and he had to be an expert engineer. He says, this man -- so it says 4:00, "This man went off duty at 11:00 p.m. It was natural that the family should often forget to watch the clock." So the 11:00 p.m., all the lights turn off. He says, "The lights would die down and go out. Then there was a careful groping about in the sudden murk to light candles and kerosene lamps." So that's just some of the hoops that they jumped through because, obviously, at this time, what was common you had to either lit candles or you like gas-powered lamps, A lot of people complained. They'd have gas-powered lamps in their house and they produce headaches and other kind of like issues with your health. Candles obviously, sometimes start fires.

"There was also the unexpected appearance of a new and powerful player. All through the war of electric currents, both Edison and Westinghouse were continually in the public eye, whether through their proxies or firsthand. Notably absent from this very public fray was the other major AC company, the Thomson-Houston Company." So the Thomson-Houston Company winds up -- it's run by, check this out. Think about where you're at in life, hopefully, you're working on things that you want to, but maybe like a lot of people, you're in a spot where you're like, man, I know I could do better. The guy that runs Thomson-Houston, you know what he did before he runs Thomson-Houston. And remember, Thomson-Houston Company merges. They went acquiring 75% of the market into General Electric. He sold shoes. He was a shoe salesman. My point being is like where you're at now is not indicative of where your life will always be. You're perfectly capable. You are a human, you're an adaptable person. You can learn new skills. You can do whatever you want to do that you set your mind to. This guy went from selling shoes to running the largest electric company in the world. Come on, that's amazing. Edison, obviously, is going to be forced into merging with him. He doesn't like the guy. Westinghouse doesn't like him either. But nonetheless, I thought it was the fact that he sold shoes before he started an electric company is quite inspiring. So there's this huge -- really, a lot of the public relations battle in the war of the currents, according to this book, is really one-sided. Edison was really attacking Westinghouse. And Westinghouse is really smart. And he's like, just this is a lesson he's -- we're going to focus on here is don't play the other person's game. So Westinghouse hires this guy's name is Heinrichs, who's a former reporter. He's basically saying, "Hey, I need positive PR. I want positive PR. I don't want you going out attacking the other people, okay?" And so Heinrichs reads a story about same thing. They're attacking AC and Westinghouse and Heinrichs is getting mad. So he runs up to Westinghouse -- Heinrichs is getting mad.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So next time you find yourself in conflict, once you -- as long as you're not letting anger or emotion blur your judgment, just like let's sit on the talk calmly and I bet we can figure this out. And in most cases, you can, and that's what Westinghouse is trying to do. Edison rebuffed him, and the part of the reason he probably rebuffed him because AC was winning by a long shot. And here he says, "Westinghouse emphasize his company's huge success. The 1888 Edison annual report showed central station orders totaling 44,000 lights." Okay, so they did 44,000 lights the whole year. "In October of 1888, his forms, orders were 48,000 lights." So he did more in October than Edison did in the entire year and Edison had a huge head start on them. Because again, other people saw the same exact thing that Tesla and Westinghouse saw that the AC was going to be -- it was going to win out. Edison does win a few battles. This is not like this war goes on for quite a bit of time. So it says, "Edison could feel happy about the drop in copper prices." So light bulbs need copper at the time. And there is -- what you're talking about there was like a small group of people try to corner in the market on the world's copper prices and try to basically create a monopoly, so they can jack up prices. That affected Edison for a little bit, and it didn't really affect Westinghouse as much because AC required less lighting -- or less copper. I don't know the exact details. Obviously, I'm not well versed in all of the materials, but that was actually -- the monopoly was penetrated and broken up, and it was actually done by like market forces like scrap dealers or whatever the case was. But anyway, the price dropped. So that's what they're talking about there. "His clear-cut light bulb patent win in the courts" that happen over and over again. "And Tesla's humbling in the real world of making things work." So what they're talking about is Westinghouse bought Tesla's AC system, whatever you want to call it. But after a year, he left Westinghouse because they couldn't make it work. He makes it work later on. They just couldn't at this point in the story.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this is something just crazy to me. This is really nothing to do with any of the 3 that we're studying today, but it was a reminder to me about that. There's always, always opportunities for entrepreneurs that are always focused on improvement because there's a lot of problems in our life that there's like the adaptability of humans is one of the greatest traits of our species, right? But it could also lead to this point where like you just -- you settle for good enough? Like this is -- and if you focus on, hey, we don't have to focus on good enough. We can actually always focus on improvement. That's where there's a lot of opportunities to companies, to products and new services, right? And one of this was -- I thought about like I've been thinking about Henry Ford a lot lately because I just covered his book a few weeks ago and how much of an improvement the automobile was compared to how people got around on horses or with their own fee. So this is the main setting for the story we're talking about today is in New York City and Pittsburgh right, but mainly New York City because that's where they started lighting up everything first. And this is -- this is the environment that these people are living in, in the 1800s in New York City, "Working largely at night when the city is much maligned street-cleaning crews spread out to remove the 2 million to 3 million pounds of horse manure, left behind each day by the city's 150,000 horses." So think about this. Before they mentioned the automobile, the primary way to get around the city was horses, horse-drawn carriages. And humans thought it was fine to have 3 million pounds of horse c*** in the city streets every day. People live like that. They're like, this is the best solution. This is good enough. And so I think for entrepreneurs always focused on improvement, you realize that there's no such thing as good enough. We can always improve and find out new ways. And eventually, of course, like New York City does not have or any other cities does not have 150,000 horses dropping a bunch of c*** everywhere now. And that's because entrepreneurs, tinkers, inventors, experimenters found a better way to transport our bodies around. Moving on, some traits that I've obviously learned from Edison among others, is patience, and persistence overcomes all.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So the lightbulb was a huge step up. And so people would jump through hoops to be able to get access to this new technology. And what I found interesting was, once it was wired up, Morgan had obviously, with any new technology hit all kinds of problems. So like sometimes, they would bury the electrical lines underneath his floorboards and then put like a rug on top. There'd be like small fires or like burning. So then they had to rewire the house over and over again. But he was just so happy that he wind up being a good like early salesman for the Edison Electric Company, which is the one he financed, one of the ones he financed, I should say. But this paragraph just reminds me that this is like the influencer marketing in the early electrical industry. The banker, they're referencing Morgan, "Was subsequently so delighted with his electricity that he gave a reception and about 400 guests came to the house and marveled at the convenience simplicity of the system. Two of the guests, California Gold rush millionaire Darius Ogden Mills, and his son-in-law, New York Daily Tribune publisher Whitelaw Reid promptly contacted the Edison Electric Illuminating Company to have their own houses electrified." So we see that obviously happen a lot where the people we admire, they start talking about other products. And very soon, we say, "Hey, we want that product as well." And then I just want to -- we're going to jump in and we're going to go back in forth. So this is going to be little different because normally I focus on just one person, right? And I originally -- when was reading the book I'm like, okay, well, maybe I'll do separate episodes, all about the book, one based on Edison, we take each person at a time because they're hugely important, hugely fascinating people. And then the more I got to the book is like, no, you know what, I'm just going to make this maybe -- even if the podcasts be a little longer. They're just -- the dynamic between all these 3 is so fascinating there's like this belongs in one podcasting, one story, and in one sitting. So with that said, I do want to read this part and we're going to jump around between the people, obviously. Why this period, in my opinion, was so important.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, "But for the visionary capitalist, electricity possessed other, more practical allures. Already, this astonishing invisible agency had birthed two radically new technologies, the telegraph and the telephone that had forever compressed and altered the age-old realities of time and distance. The most farsighted were tantalized by even greater electrical prizes. Who would further harness electricity to light the nation's streets, its dim factories, and all those millions of households dramatically transforming man's age-old sense of day and night." Like I was just referencing, once the sun sets, if you didn't have candles, you don't have lamps, that was the end of your day. "Of even greater moment in these commercial times, who would harness electricity to operate work-saving machines, mechanisms artfully reinvented to liberate humankind from the hard toil of farm and factory. He who could unleash the full only dreamed of potential of electricity and control this awesome and visible power would become wealthy and powerful indeed." "Was it any wonder the war of electric current would be so fiercely waged." So that may -- that's actually what this book is about that term there, the war of electric currents, that is what the battle between the entrepreneurs, Edison with his direct current and then Westinghouse and a few other people and then obviously, the inventions of Tesla with the alternating current. And now before I continue talking about Edison, I want to take a slight tangent, a slight right turn here because I always talk about this idea that books are the original links. They lead us from one idea to another or one person to another much like the modern web does. And in this book, so -- and this kind of relates to what we're doing here, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

In this book, a lot of people, a lot of early entrepreneurs, inventors, tinkers in the electrical industry, we're going off of and inspired by people that came before them, right? So when I talk about Founders podcast people and person, I was like, listen, what is Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Steve Jobs have in common? And the answer is they all learned and studied from entrepreneurs that came before them and that influenced their ideas and business and how their life turned out, right? Well, a lot of the early inventors in the electricity field, excuse me, were influenced by Faraday -- Michael Faraday, who you might have heard of. And this book, Empires of Light talks a lot about Faraday. So I'm only going to read like 2 paragraphs from -- about him just so you have understand who he is. I mean he's hugely influential and this caused me to find biographies on him, and he's going to appear in a future Founders podcast. He's not technically an entrepreneur, but he thinks like one and he acts like one. So let me just read this part before I get into Edison. And Edison was hugely influenced by Faraday. So this is one quote from a biography of Faraday. He says, "Such was the prodigality of his output and the diversity of his skills that modern chemists, no less than physicists, engineers, and material scientists regarded him as the founder of their subjects." "Some scientists and technologies owe their very existence to his work. He bequeathed to posterity a greater body of pure scientific achievement than any other physical scientist and the practical consequences of his discoveries have profoundly influenced the nature of civilized life." So he says, -- and then just a quote from him. Okay, yes. This is Faraday. He says, "A philosopher should be a man willing to listen to every suggestion but determined to judge for himself. He should not be biased by appearances, have no favorite hypothesis, be of no school, and in doctrine have no master. Truth should be his primary object."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then in turn, so all Edison and a bunch of other of these, maybe even Tesla were inspired by Faraday. Faraday was in turn inspired by Benjamin Franklin. He says Faraday like to quote Benjamin Franklin. So they were asking like what is the -- before I read you the quote like he would create like a new chemical process or a new electric magnetic realm and then people would inevitably over and over again when he makes some kind of discovery like what is its use, like I don't understand. And it says, "Faraday liked to quote Benjamin Franklin, who had famously replied. 'What is the use of an infant?' The answer of the experimentalist is endeavor to make it useful." I think it's our job to make these discoveries useful and practical and that's exactly what they were doing. They were -- their book talks about -- they were experimenting. There are records of humans experimenting with electricity for a couple of thousands of years. And in some cases, there'll be progress, then nothing would happen for 500 years and somebody else picks it up. And then 200 years, and then finally, in the late 1800s, we have a huge amount of progress. All right, so this is what motivated Edison to work on electrical lighting. At this time, he's in his mid-'30s. He is already super, super famous. One of the most famous Americans living easily. And this actually worked towards his benefit in starting this company. He said, Edison -- so he was -- at first, his friend was trying to get him to go check out like these new electrical dynamos and these experiments with lighting. And he was -- he's like no, I'm too busy, too busy, then eventually he goes and he's blown away. And he says," Edison was now afire with excitement. Ever the competitor, he turned to his host, William Wallace, and said, 'I believe I can beat you making the electric light. I do not think you're working in the right direction.'" So something that Jill, the author, talks about a lot, is Edison's extremely cocky.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He says, "For 4 years," now we jumped ahead in the story. "Edison had worked as hard as ever as he had on any one project. And he was understandably nervous that would actually perform as promised. Edison was now 35 years old, and while his face still looked at youthful as ever. His brown hair had turned gray in the years since he had blithely and innocently promised to light up all of Lower Manhattan with his light bulb." So think about that. He got a lot of initial traction after 1 week, took over 4 years to finally find the filament. That's persistence. And this is what Edison wanted or as I would say, like everybody needs to know their why, like why are you doing what you're doing? Like what is your why? So this Edison's why. "Before him, the great inventor saw only more glory and great fortune, which to Edison translated into utter freedom to exercise his prodigious gifts as an inventor. He explained, 'My one ambition is to be able to work without regard to the expense. I want none of the rich man's usual toys. I want no horses or yachts. I have no time for them. What I want is the perfect workshop.'" And that is actually a belief held by a lot. But I would say, Edison, Tesla, and Westinghouse. In fact, I was just watching a talk. Steve Jobs gave back in like the late '90s, and he talked about how he was influenced by Bill Hewlett and David Packard, specifically the fact that they wrote down the principles of their company. It's called the HP Way. I actually read that book and did a podcast on it, you can find it in the Founders archive. But he talked about, he is like the first thing they said in the HP Way is that we have to make a profit. That's the very first thing. They weren't -- and they said they have to make a profit so they can go on building other products. And I like that as opposed to building a product to make a profit. And so no, no, we're going to make profits, so we can make products that make the world better.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I covered this a little bit because if you -- long-time Founder's listeners, remember, I think it's like Founders episode #2. I did the Thomas Edison biography, the Wizard of Menlo Park, and they talked about that a lot in there. He was extremely confident in his own abilities. So he says, "Edison rushed back to his research workshop to throw himself into creating a better and more practical electrical light". This is electric light, this is actually an important part. "He worked feverishly thrilled at the possibilities of this new field. It was all before me" -- this is a quote from Edison. "I saw the thing had not gone so far," meaning the industry is still new, "But that I had a chance, I saw what had been done and had never been made practically useful. The intense light had not been subdivided so they could be brought into private housing." So that's an important part. It's like you've got to lower that. It's too bright. And he understood at the very beginning. Of course, people are going to want an alternative candles and kerosene lamps, like electrical light was really important. And this brings you to a point, I guess I wasn't expecting to think about -- talk about this, but Jeff Bezos has this great -- there is this video on YouTube where he's saying, took an 18-minute talk, I took notes on it. I'll actually link my notes in the show notes. So you can read them if you want, and it also links to the video. But Jeff is like, listen, "A lot of people," -- and this talk is like 15 or probably 15 years old, right? And in it, Jeff, is like "a lot of people think like the early -- the analogy for the Internet revolution that we're going through right now is the gold age." He's like, "No, I don't think that's the right metaphor." And he gives all these examples from history what -- of how he thinks about it. And he says, "The growth of the Internet is going to be -- is going to look closer to the growth of the early electricity industry," which is really interesting. And because Jeff was like they're not -- people were not saying, "Hey, like, why are my house for electricity." They were -- they said, "Why are my house for lighting?" And he is saying, "essentially the killer app of the electric industry before was the light bulb."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And this is what Edison is working on right now and where we're at in the book. He's like, "Well, I actually think that I could be doing this better. I can make it more practical, which is obviously what he endeavored to do for all of his inventions." And he wind up succeeding because he gets the patent. He winds up fighting patent wars for like, I don't know, just probably hundreds, if not thousands of lawsuits trying to stop people from infringing on this patent, and it's upheld all the way up to the Supreme Court if I'm not mistaken. And so Edison gets the patent for the first, I think it's incandescent bulb. So that's what he's working on here. He says, "The man who came up with the best arc light system might well make a fortune stealing away even that 10% of the gas lighting business." And he is saying so even on the tiniest and that's -- he's just talking about streetlights. So even if you could just take 10% of the gas light at streetlight, you already have a fortune. So they knew from the very beginning the size, and the magnitude of the industry. "But the man you could subdivide the light to take it indoors and tame it into a gentle glow," which is what the light bulb does, right "And power it with a dynamo," which that doesn't happen anymore, at least not in the way they did it back then, "He would be the true Promethean. The blazing electrical Pioneer, the hailed benefactor of humankind and he becomes wealthy to boot. The race to illuminate with electricity the houses and offices of America was on." Okay, so we're going to stick with Thomas Edison for a little while because how Jill, the author, she starts out talking at -- to basically build a foundation to understand how each individual thought about electricity one by one gives us some background and then the story unfold on how they interact with each other.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this is just -- I'm going to do a brief introduction to Thomas Edison. It says, "Thomas Edison had announced he was becoming a full-time inventor in early 1869." So now we're going back in time, okay? "The previous 6 years had been spent drifting from city to city as a Western Union operator, while he was continually devising improvements in telegraphy," remember, they just referenced to set the stage for the time we're in, the 2 huge improvements with human communications one of those telegraph. "And he was soaking up technical books on telegraphy and electricity." He's a lifetime voracious reader and learner. "Once committed to full-time inventing, Edison had done well enough with such clever items as an electric copying pen, but he really hit the jackpot in late 1974 when he sold rights to his quadruplex telegraph system to Western Union and Wall Street manipulator Jay Gould, for $30,000." Give you an idea at the time what that $30,000 mean like a typical labor, like let's say, when the electrical industry is up and about, they have tons of people like laying the wires like working people in the field, they would make about $12 a week. Okay, so it says, "This was heady success for small town-boy from Port Huron, Michigan, whose father had muddled along in various grocery real estate and truck farming enterprises." "Edison had received very little formal education being taught mainly by his mother. His boyhood revolved largely around his many ingenious efforts to make mechanical things or brew new chemistry experiments. Including one that produced an explosion that wrecked a corner of a building and burn Edison and some of the boys." "When Edison was 13, he joined the Grand Trunk Railroad as a newsboy. He impresses bosses as a hardworking, entrepreneurial, and intent on self-improvement." Those are really good traits to have those 3, hardworking, entrepreneurial, and obviously focus on self-improvement.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"He spent $2 to join the new Detroit Public Library," which was 2 days of his pay at the time. This gives you an indication of how hungry he was for knowledge. So he spent 2 days pay join the Detroit Public Library and proceeded to read his way through the shelves. "It was during these railroading years that Edison became partially deaf." Now I didn't remember this part. I knew he was personally deaf because he had some funny lines about being partially deaf saves them from like the cacophony, I think, is the word he used of like ridiculous like everyday talk that people have. But the reason I want to bring this to your attention is because I think the -- there's a lot of things that we can't control that happen to us in life, but we can control the frame of mind in which that we look at these things. And he took a positive spin on a very negative event. He says, ever the -- so this guy, one of the conductors grab him by the ear for some reason and like lifted them and something snapped inside one of his ears and his deafness started from that time. So it's a terrible thing to happen, right? But it says, "Ever the optimist, Edison viewed his deafness as an advantage, a built-in buffer against outside distractions that help them concentrate on whatever he was doing." "Edison's avid curiosity about all things mechanical had led him to befriend the local telegraph operator whoever he was. When Edison turned 16 in 1863 has natural flair for banging out and receiving Morse code, which was honed by 18-hour bouts of practice, earned him a slot as a junior operator. The civil war was going on at this time and telegraphers were in great demand." So sometimes you're just -- you're at the right place at the right time. Timing is really important in these things. "And so Edison was launched into the world of telegraphy, invention, money, and getting ahead." So now this is Edison's approach to work and the power of inspired work and the different paths you can take. "So when Edison was on to a problem, there was no day or night, just hours in which to work as his long-suffering neglected wife and 2 small children well knew." So I bring that up because -- so obviously, we're -- we want to grab the best ideas from a lifetime of experience that these entrepreneurs have, right? But we also want to learn from their mistakes.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Now it's great to work on something you're passionate about, to love it so much that you want to dedicate a lot of time to it. Very few people in life find something like that. But to me, in my opinion, like I wouldn't -- like family is extremely important. So I don't think neglecting your wife and your small -- 2 small children, he ends up having 6 children. And he basically sacrifices family life for invention. You have to be who you are, it just -- for me, that's a bad trade. It either winds up to some of his kids want to being estrange, and they basically says he is a c***** father. "Edison could rarely pull himself away long enough to dine at home instead of fueling himself on yet another slice of apple pie." That was a really weird thing that I learned that he sustained himself just by eating apple pie. So now he's -- and this is a sign of his cockiness. Remember, he toured William Wallace's shop and he says, "A mere week since the tour of Wallace's shop, Edison pronounced with his characteristic hubris to the reporter from the New York Sun that he, Edison, would be the one to succeed with the electric light where others had failed. He, Edison, would be the Prometheus." They used that word so many times in his book, "Who would define the secrets of this mysterious agency and light up America and the world. He had in one inspired week just invented the first practical incandescent light bulb." So that is partially true, but partially not true. He had got one set up in 1 week, yes. But then he would -- the search for the right material. I think it was a filament is what they're called, took a very long time after that. So the basic idea was there after 1 week, and he had to run constant -- numerous maybe countless is the better word experiments to try to find the filament that wouldn't burn out and it could actually last.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He says, I have -- and this is Edison, and he's not going to give too much details because he hasn't secured the patent yet, but he says, "I have obtained it. The light through an entirely different process than that from which scientists have sought to secure it. They had all been working in the same group." And so that's the power of inspired work on a different path. Realizing, okay, well, everybody is running the same experiments, they're working the same roof, -- maybe let me attack this same problem and find a solution in a different manner, and that's what he did. This is just Faraday inspiring Edison. "Edison was a voracious and penetrating reader, hungry for knowledge and possessing an amazing memory." So he says, "Edison had avidly consumed all 3 volumes of British scientist Michael Faraday's book and the book is called Experimental Researches in Electricity and Magnetism." "Faraday became an immediate hero, a poor London boy who rose to the top ranks of science on brains and hard work alone. To Edison, Faraday had been living proof that the secrets of nature could be revealed through a determined experiment and astute observation." "Beloved as Edison was by an odd and respected public. His cocky ways and phenomenal early success had deeply irked his many scientific and inventing rivals, especially the gentleman of academia." So this is also -- you'll see Westinghouse has to deal with this. Tesla definitely has to deal with this. A lot of people did not like him belittling their work, understandably so. But I just wanted to bring this part because I had this in so many of these episodes, I had a section that I like tongue-in-cheeky called critics don't know s_*_, and it's not that saying that like you should ignore all criticism, it's just that it is inevitable. I don't think I can think of one example of the biographies that I've read and covered on the podcast where people at the very beginning, told the entrepreneur or the founder, the inventor, no, it's not going to work. Oh, you're going to fail, why are you doing this? Why are you trying to be different?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It's just a part of human nature. Human nature does not change. This happened hundreds of years ago. It will happen 100 years in the future. And you're going to see this where you have -- what they just said, the gentleman of academia, were like Edison is a liar, like this is ridiculous. And so let me give you a quote. And this is just silly nonsense. And we know this is silly nonsense because we're living in the world that Edison helped partially birth. So this guy's name, I'm not going to say his name, it doesn't matter. He's scoffed in a public lecture. What a c_*_ -- and I wrote who is the cocky one, and you understand why I wrote that after you hear the sentence he says. "We have heard a great deal of late of Mr. Edison's discovery of a means of indefinitely dividing the light. I cannot tell you what his method may be, but I can tell you that any system depending on incandescent light will fail." So how -- like they're saying he's cocky, right? How cocky is it to say, I don't know what -- how he's doing it or what even -- what the details are, but I'm just going to make this pronouncement that nope, it's never -- it's impossible. Like you just have no idea if it's impossible. So I bring that up because inevitably, whatever you're working on, sometimes it's customers, sometimes it's your own family, sometimes it's friends. Sometimes it's strangers on the Internet. You're going to experience criticism. It's just what humans do. They just like to babble on about stuff they know nothing about. And it's best for you to just ignore it. I mean if there's some element of truth then listen, is that true? And if it's -- if you find it to be true, then hopefully, you can use that as helpful information that's actually useful criticism. But if what just some people saying, "Oh, no, this is impossible. I have no details. I haven't looked at it and oh, I'm just talking," then ignore them.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Edison is -- this is something I talked about a lot. I talk about this with friends and family that one of my fair quotes is action expresses priority. So your actions actually tell the world what is actually important to you. There's a lot of people that say, "Oh, I want to set a business. I want to lose weight. I want to do X, Y, and Z." And then you look at their actions and it's like, "Oh, you don't actually want to do that. You're just playing -- it's a fairytale in your mind." So Edison is telling us with his actions what to do, and that's to avoid distractions. "Edison, who had always been easily available to any reporter looking for a story now put off all requests." Now what's taking place at this time is he's got the light bulb working, but he doesn't have the filament that's working. So he's like, "All right, I'm avoiding distractions. I cannot entertain reporters like I normally do because I got to solve this problem." Okay, so he's raised a little bit of money. Obviously, these are hugely capital-intensive businesses, but he's getting a lot of pushbacks. And this section made me think of a quote that I've been actually thinking about it a lot lately. And it comes from the podcast I did on Jim Clark, Founder of Silicon Graphics, Netscape, other companies. One of the craziest stories. If you haven't listen to it, go back and listen to it. Jim Clark, it's based on Michael Lewis book, The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story. But he has a quote in there that I've been recently thinking about where at the time, Jim was like trying to raise more money and people are like waffling. I think let's say he needed $20 million. I don't remember the exact number. But he's like, you know what, I'm not -- they're like, "Oh, they're trying to make some concessions or basically dilly-dallying," for lack of a better word. And Jim is like, "You know what, forget it, I'll put up the money myself, I'll do it." And then this inevitably resulted as kind of predictable, then they became extremely interested because then they had FOMO. They're like, oh, no, we're going to miss out. He's going to just do it himself. So we'll do it. And then the part that stuck out to me is what Jim said about it. He was raised in a small Southern town in Texas. So he has like a really interesting way to think about things. And he says to do anything great you need pigs and not chickens, right? And this is one of my favorite metaphors.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And Thomas Edison is experiencing the same thing. He needs pigs, not chickens. So it says, "Jim Clark like to say that human beings when they took risks, fell into 1 of 2 types, pigs or chickens." And this is a quote from Jim. He says, "The difference between these 2 kinds of people is the difference between the pig and the chicken in the ham and eggs breakfast. The chicken is interested. The pig is committed if you're going to do anything worth doing, you need a lot of pigs." So obviously, the pig gave his life, and the chicken just laid an egg. So we see an echo of that about 150 years early before Jim experienced the same thing. He says -- this is now Edison talking. He says, "We were confronted by stupendous obstacle. Nowhere in the world could we attain any of the items or devices necessary for the exploration of the system. The directors of the Edison Electric Light Company would not go into manufacturing. Thus, forced to the wall, I was forced to go into manufacturing myself." So you don't want to spend the money on manufacturing, forget it, I'll do it. Since cap -- listen, the words Edison uses here, "Since capital is timid, I will raise and supply it. The issue is factories or death." So Edison is a pig. He's committed. The people that have funded him up until this point are chickens. You need -- if you're going to do something great, you need pigs, not chickens. "To show he was not kidding Edison had boldly established a light bulb factory out at Menlo Park, which by the end of the year was turning out several hundred bulbs daily. This was controlled and financed by Edison himself who sold electric stock and borrowed whenever he could." So he's fully in. He is like listen, we're not like -- if we don't do this, we die, so we have to do it.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

That's how Edison thought about it. That's how Tesla thought about it. That's how Westinghouse. Westinghouse winds up being a very wealthy man. He has like $50 million by the time he dies, in early 1900 money. But he focused solely on like building products for the good of humanity, and I would argue that the same thing with Steve Jobs, like you can go and look at the house he lived in or like the fact that he -- I don't think you ever sold stock. I know they borrow against, and they do all the other stuff. But he wasn't in it. He had -- he was in it for the right reasons. And to me, the right reason is to build the best product possible. Now by product of building the best product possible is you're going to have -- assuming you're running your business correctly, you're going to have profits. But what are you going to do with your profits since for Edison, Tesla. Tesla winds up making a little bit of money too, and I'll get to that in a minute. It was always just so they can invent and make more products. I feel like there is a theme there between Edison and Tesla and Westinghouse and Hewlett and Packard and Jobs that I think is important to realize. It says, -- I mean, even thinking about what Jeff Bezos is doing. He's taking -- he's liquidating about $1 billion a year in his Amazon stock and he's putting it into Blue Origin. He -- I mean, he can spend $1 billion on all kinds of ridiculous consumption. And he's like, no, I want to -- I had a passion since I was 5 years old, about space and rockets. And I feel like it's my obligation to humanity. All right. So now we're going to go into Tesla. What a character this guy is. Nikola Tesla was truly possessed by only one great passion, the mystery of all things electric." So let's see, it says, "Has settled into a strenuous scheduled to begin at 5:00 a.m." Now this is -- so he's going to start working for Edison's company in France.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Now this is a schedule. He's such an interesting person. So "He settled into a strenuous schedule that began at 5:00 a.m. Every morning, regardless of the weather, Tesla explained, I would go from where I resided to a bathing house on the River Seine," I don't know how to pronounce that. "Plunge into the water, loop the circuit, which means swim laps, 27 times, and then walk an hour to reach the factory where the company was located. It was a considerable coup for a young man who's whole soul resonated to the little-known mysteries of electricity. Here he was in the expanding Edison Empire." So he starts working there. It says, "It quickly showed he was a reliable troubleshooter, capable of solving most electrical tangles. However, talented Tesla was as an engineer, he was also a decidedly odd fellow," so he's a misfit, what a surprise. "Tesla was prey to strange habits and phobias. He silently counted each step he took as he made his early morning walk down to the factory. Every activity had to be divisible by 3, hence the 27 laps each morning." "Before eating or drinking anything, he felt obliged to calculate its cubic contents. He deeply disliked shaking hands with anyone. He had a violent aversion against the earrings of women, well, pearls above all, freaked him out," -- that's weird. I would not -- and this is Tesla talking, "I would not touch the hair of other people, except perhaps at the point of a revolver and the mere sight of a peach brought on a fever." What? This is Tesla, "I was intended for my very birth for the clerical profession, and this thought constantly oppressed me." So he talks about why he left his native Serbia that he was very -- his Serbian family was very against his experimentation. So it says -- this is Tesla in high school. This is more critics, obviously. "Tesla, prodigy in math and physics fell even more deeply and irrevocably in thrall to the still nascent science of electricity. He alarmed his professors with his voracious and exhausting appetite for work, especially if it had to do with electricity."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"It is impossible for me to convey an adequate idea of the intensity of feeling I was experiencing and witnessing my physics teacher's exhibitions of the mysterious phenomenon." So this is where he's falling in love with his life work. And he started -- he worked on this up until he died in his 80s. "Every impression produced 1,000 echoes in my mind. I wanted to know more of this wonderful force." And I'm going to share a lot of quotes with you from Tesla. He's got a very poetic way of speaking. So he goes -- this is important, though. So his teacher gives a demonstration of this thing called a Gramme machine. And Tesla, this is another example of like critics where Tesla realizes -- well, let me just read this too, actually. So let's see. So it's says, notice Tesla, there's -- here is a quote from Tesla says, "sparking badly," talking about the Gramme machine. "And I observed that it might be possible to operate a motor without these appliances," meaning all these moving parts that they needed to alternate the current. "But my professor declared it could not be done and did me the honor of delivering a lecture on the subject. At the conclusion, he remarked, 'Mr. Tesla may accomplish great things, but he certainly will never do this.'" "It would be the equivalent of converting a steadily pulling force like that of gravity into a rotary effort. It is a perpetual motion scheme, an impossible idea." And he is saying this in public, like why would you do that? Initially deeply embarrassed by such a public rebuke, Tesla the dreamer could not resist. However, thinking about the pointlessness of the sparking commutators."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I don't know what those things are. He winds up actually accomplishing this very feat that his professor says is impossible, and he ends up selling a variation of this idea to Westinghouse, which we'll cover later. And it took years and years and years. I'm skipping ahead in the book, but this is Tesla's response to solving a problem that he worked on for more than 5 years. And this is Tesla talking to his friend about it. He says, "Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it a sublime? Isn't it simple? I have solved the problem. Now I can die happy," and I keep -- he's a very young man. "But I must live. I must return to work and build a motor so I can give it to the world. No more will men be slaves to hard tasks. My motor will set them free. It will do the work of the world." And what he's talking about the work, he's talking about is AC. It's alternating current. He was interval in bringing this new technology to life. Unfortunately, as we'll see later in the book, like you never captured nearly -- he dies basically penniless, and he never captured the value that he actually provided to the world. He was not a good businessman, unfortunately. But I want to bring up that point because he actually dreamed, daydreamed obviously, it didn't happen all at once, he was thinking about this problem and working on it for many years, but he solved the solution in his mind. Then he says, "I have to build it." So that's what I mean. He's got a very -- I've never come across a person like Nikola Tesla before, it's basically what I'm trying to say. Okay, so now we're -- I'm just going to give you some early responses to electricity. People were pessimistic about it. And they called it like witchcraft. This is one quote. "We are not yet in the habit of observing machines that function without apparent cause." Remember, electricity is largely invisible, right? "Their occult workings baffle us. The secret of their existence escapes us." The naïve and enthusiastic Tesla was soon explaining his wonderful alternating current induction motor, that's what he was talking about, "And full system to these new colleagues and bosses." This is happening at Edison factory. But remember, Edison is dedicated to direct current.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Assuming that they of all people would appreciate it at a time when the understanding of electricity was still quite primitive, polyphase alternating current was a quantum leap and difficult to grasp." So that's what Tesla was working on, okay? "Tesla's exuberant and idealistic plan to liberate the world from drudgery was not at all obvious even to those working in the field. What they knew and understood was direct current electricity where the electrons flowed only in one direction and created a little magnetic field." So Tesla -- this is Tesla creates a lot of enemies within the industry because like this is -- he's basically saying this is dumb. There's a much better way to do it. Direct current, it's not going to last because it was limited. He'd have to build -- the reason they start in New York City because you needed population density. So they build like the stations and each individual station could electrify houses and offices anywhere from a half a mile to 1 mile radiance. But after that, you had to build another one where alternating current, you could actually build the factories that are producing the power much closer to the actual fuel source. And that's how we do it today. You see the electrical lines, either running like on these wires in the road or they're buried underground, but they travel with very long distances. And so Tesla is like this -- like you're not going to be able to spread and he framed it in like idealistic terms. He's trying to free humans from drudgery, liberation is what he would constantly use. He's not going to be able to do that, working long distances under a current. You have to use my current. So this is surprising, but still true to this day, and also an insight into what it's like building a company in a new industry.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And this is a quote from one of Edison's managers. It says, "People generally did not at all appreciate the need or value of electricity. They had to be educated to its use. Suitable manufacturing methods as well as adequate ways of distributing the manufactured product had to be devised." So what they're saying is, not only like you have to create the product, but you have to create every single process that you need in this nascent industry, including distribution. Customers did not -- check this out. This is such a great quote. "Customers did not exist. They had to be created. A litany of insufficient capital, shipments that needed to be speeded up." This is some of the product problems that they're having in New York laying on this electrical wire. So it says, "A litany of insufficient capital, shipments that needed to be speeded up, fickle clients have isolated plants." That's the direct current plans, "Problematic and erratic machines and poor quality supplies. Many of these difficulties will resolve fairly easily, but others were major embarrassments and threatened great financial consequences." So every day, they had more fires and more chaos to deal with. This is Tesla on meeting Edison. He finally comes to America because he realizes like that's -- if he is obsessed with electricity, that's where electricity is happening. He needs to go there. At the time, like I said, he was working at a factory, Edison's factory, one of his in Europe, in France. He says, "Meeting with Edison was a memorable event in my life. I was amazed that this wonderful man who without early advantages and scientific training had accomplished so much. I had studied a dozen languages, delved in a literature and art, and had spent my best years in libraries reading all sorts of the stuff that fell into my hands," meaning he had a broader education. "And then I felt most of my life had been squandered." He is like maybe I made a mistake. Maybe I didn't needed this, look what Edison is accomplishing. But he realized this, no, no, that's -- the fact that I spent all this time, having a broad set of life experiences is actually better because he was able to see the deficiencies in Edison's systems.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But he says, "But it did not take long before I recognize that, that was the best thing I could have done." I mean, he is constantly exposing himself and learning about new things. So this is -- I left my note to myself. I don't know. No one is always right, no one is perfect. Let's see what that meant. It says, "Tesla pointed out that a central station based on alternating current dynamos could liberate," there's a word again, "Electricity from the 1-mile shackle of Edison's DC plants." "Moreover, his AC induction motor would surely be superior to those operating on DC." This is what -- now I understand my note. Edison, when Tesla is telling Edison this, Edison responded very bluntly that he was not interested in alternating current, and then this is Edison being extremely wrong. That's what I meant about no one is perfect. "There was no future to it and anyone who dabbled in that field was wasting his time. And besides, it was a deadly current whereas direct current was safe." So obviously, Edison, we know, I guess, the world we live in is AC-powered that Edison was wrong. And these 2 do not -- they don't mix well. Tesla and Edison are very much like oil and water and Tesla leaves, and he starts his own company, and he says, "Tesla lasted less than a year as Edison's employee in New York. In truth, he and Edison were like oil and water, each are amused and annoyed by the other. Far worse believed Tesla was Edison's approach to science." And there's a quote from -- now this is really interesting because there's multiple ways to succeed in any complex endeavor, right? And so this is Tesla saying that, he doesn't like Edison's approach. He said, "If Edison had a needle to find in a haystack, he would proceed at once with the diligence of the bee to examine straw after straw until he found the object of a search. His method was inefficient in the extreme for the immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And Tesla suggests to us a different alternative. He says, "A little theory and calculation could have seemed to 90% of his labor." Edison in turn, dismissed Tesla as a poet of science, whose ideas were magnificent but utterly impractical. So that's -- 2 very different people. And again, they could both -- they're both very smart, make a lot of inventions, succeed at life, and take different approaches. Now I'm going to talk a little bit about the dramatic ups and downs of the life of Nikola Tesla. And he says, "I've lived through a year of terrible heartaches and bitter tears. My suffering is being intensified by material wants." So he has no money at this time, he is starting his own company. "Scraping by in the cold winter, Tesla was reduced many a day to working in a New York labor gang." And he just has such a -- I'm going to eventually cover a biography of just of his because his life is so interesting. Just a little bit I learned about it from this book. And so he's in this like labor, New York gang and he's doing physical work. And then one of the people he's working with realizes this guy has like a hell of a mind behind. And so he sets up a meeting for a potential patron. And he just does -- he doesn't experiment, where he's like figures out how to command the electromagnetic field and make well, let me just read this. "He placed the egg on the table and to their astonishment, it stood on end. But what they -- when they found it was rapidly spinning their stupefaction was complete." So he has used very -- like a flare for the dramatic and he would do these lectures or these experimentations and that's where he winds up building most of reputation to make him famous.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"No sooner had they regained their composure than they delighted Tesla with their question, 'Do you need any money?'" Of course he needs money, he has no money at the time. Nikola Tesla's life was taking another one of its dramatic turns. After the betrayal of his partners, his winter of pauperism " -- I skipped over part. He started a company. They did a little bit of financing and then they just stole all his work and kicked him out. Nikola Tesla was once again launched on his long-deferred electrical dream, and that electrical dream is to bring alternating current to the world. Finally, he would be able to build the whole AC system he had dreamed of for so long. Okay. So now we got to the part about George Westinghouse, and I just want to give you a little bit of background to him, right? And this is the time he starts to realize I'm going to work in this industry as well. He says, "By 1884 at just 37, he had already assembled a formidable empire in fortune in the free-willing world of railroads, the most important and ruthless corporate force in America." So he was already -- before he started working in the field of electricity. He was already well established and really successful entrepreneur. "He is started at age 22, he introduced his most momentous invention, a revolutionary air brake that allowed the engineers of a passenger train for the first time to quickly and safely stop all the cars." "Westinghouse had, had a struggle finding anyone willing to back this novel and expensive venture. And so far, far wiser when he finally did introduce his air brake, he staunchly refused to give the railroads licenses, saying only he would manufacture them in his small Pittsburgh works." So one, I want to stop and tell you what the alternative was before he invented the air brake system. So let's say there's something on the track and at the time, the train had to stop. The engineer had to go back in every single car and break it manually one by one by one. And so the airbrake system used compressors to do that all at once. So the whole train would stop.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I think like why would he say that? And it's because missionaries believe. They have a deep belief in what they're doing, right? They're sacrificing their time, sometimes their safety to spread the word of what they believe in, right? And I think it's really important to realize that, that scales up and down. And in fact, on an individual level, it only takes one person to really, really believe in an idea. And as long as that person is unrelenting and willing to not give up, they can motivate and gather other energy from those around them and push that idea forward. And so this is what he does. They invent the modern transformer, electrical transformer. He says, "The opposition by all the electric," -- and this is happening in his own company. So the reason -- I should give you a background. He -- George is realizing exactly what Tesla realized that AC is the future, right? And so -- but everybody in this early industry was trained in direct current. So like, no, no, just focus on what's already out there. And it took Westinghouse to have this unrelenting belief in AC. And he's like, even the opposition -- he overcomes the opposition of his own company. So he says, "The opposition by all the electric part of the Westinghouse organization was such that it was only Mr. George Westinghouse's personal will that put it through. No one besides Westinghouse understood the tremendous breakthrough represented by the AC transformer, a machine that could take high voltages that had traveled long distances and stepped them down for safe use in entire factories or homes, undeterred by the chorus of naysayers at his own company." So what do you believe in? What do you believe in so much that you're willing to dedicate and to say, no, no, I understand that you may not understand this, but let me explain to you why I believe this is true? I think it's a very important like a pause and really think about like what am I working on? What am I doing? Do I have this deep belief? Because it's one of the rarest things in life to be able to work on something you truly, truly believe in.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So then the second part, I think, is really important to notice. He's like when he did introduces air-brake, he didn't sell licenses, right, saying that he is going to own them. He will manufacture them, right? This reminded me. So there's a lot of -- I've read 2 books on Howard Hughes. So Howard Hughes is one of the most famous people that ever lived, movies made about them. And all I could think of after studying him is we should -- there should be books written about is dad, not him. I mean what he did in aviation was impressive and other things, yes. But like one of the greatest business decisions of ever -- one of the greatest strategic business moves ever has got to be Howard Hughes Senior when he found Hughes Tool Company which is the vehicle for which printed money, hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars and that his son controlled later on after Howard Hughes Senior died, was he came up with a way to -- he developed a drilling bit, right, that would enable oil speculators to drill deeper and to access hidden fields of oil, right? And they're like, "Oh, I want to buy, I want to buy" and he said, "You're not going to buy this from me. I'm going to own it. I'm going to lease it to you" which means you're going to pay me every month, right? And I'll service and do repairs. And what happened is he's breakeven happened really fast. I don't remember, let's say, a month or 2 after. And so everything after that was pure profit. And Hughes Tool Company has got to be one of the most profitable companies that ever existed. It's got to be. I mean they printed profits for like 40 years of astounding -- just an astounding measure. So Westinghouse is doing the same thing here. He's like, "No, I'm going to control this. You're not going to manufacture. I'm going to -- like I'm not going to sell you licenses, I'm going to manufacture them. I'm going to make them myself, and I'm going to control that.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It says, "When Westinghouse felt the railroad, however powerful, were trading on his turf. He interviewed forcefully, threatening patent lawsuits usually in person." Having seen his first patents expropriated by the railroads that this happened in his early -- before the invention, before the air brakes, he got s over. "So they took his patents and his first company consequently dwindle away, Westinghouse assumed a lifelong ferocity when it came to his products and patents." So he is just learning from it. "He also discovered railroad signaling. So it's another business that he built. In 1881, he began buying up promising patents, most important ones that controlled electric circuit set off by trains, thereby activating signals." So they needed to know when trains are coming and to switch tracks and whatever the case was. "By combining these with its own improvements, inventions, Westinghouse soon dominated this new field." It says, "The oil lamps used in the signaling system were problematic and existing electric companies were unhelpful with solutions." So this is the genesis of the ideas maybe I should get involved in this other -- this new industry. "When Westinghouse surveyed the state of the electrical art as embodied by Edison and its competitors, it did not much excite him except as a sure way to develop a large enterprise." So he saw an opportunity. The physical -- he saw the exact same thing that Tesla saw. He says, "The physical limitations of Edison's direct current central station was more than evidence. The future foretold an insatiable demand for small direct current central stations, serving mild square areas and individual isolated plants." So he knew that there was going to be a lot of demand for Edison's new system, but eventually knew that he's going to run out because it's -- there's -- America is largely rural at this time. Like you can't -- what was working in New York City in 1880, is not going to work for the vast majority, but it will with AC. And then this is Westinghouse greatest advantage, and then we're going to contrast Edison and Westinghouse a little bit here, too.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he says, this is Westinghouse -- direct quote from Westinghouse, "My early greatest capital was the experience and skill acquired from the opportunity given me when I was young to work with all kinds of machinery, coupled later with the lessons in that discipline to which a soldier is required to submit." So he was -- when he was young boy, he was exposed -- also his family works and build machines. And so he was constantly tinkering, constantly obsessed to see how things worked and constantly improve it. And at the same time, the civil war is going on and he tries to go when he was like 15 years old, he runs away, he tries to join the civil war. He goes back because his parents are going to let him, 2 years later, I think maybe 3 years earlier, maybe 16 or 17 -- maybe 17 or 18 at the time, and he winds up serving and fighting for the north in the civil war. And so his childhood was formed by these 2 twin factors. This idea that I can make machines, I can create things that other people use, which is extremely powerful idea. And he also had discipline instilled in him, the soldier's discipline when you are fighting a war. So he combined these two into a career. "He was very much a man to contend with, the founder of 4 successful companies." "Unlike Edison, who preferred to use only his own patented work, Westinghouse already had long and reasonably happy experience with purchasing other inventor's better ideas and improving them in his own shops." So that's as MO. "Westinghouse was nowhere near as famous as of flamboyant Edison. He usually refuses requests for interviews and stories, and he explains why. 'If my face becomes too familiar to the public, every bore or crazy schemer will insist on buttonholing me,'" so he wanted his privacy. "In private, however, he was intensely compelling, forthright, blunt and often charismatic. He could charm the bird out of a tree." And now here's a story from one of his employees. And this is part of the reason I've come away from this book, very much admiring Mr. Westinghouse. Why am I calling him Mr. Westinghouse? George, let me call him by his first name. I'm definitely going to read his biography and turn into a future Founders episode. And this is one of the reasons. So this is one of his employees talking. They're trying to like wheel -- let me give you some background here.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

They're taking like equipment they need and supplies they need from one of his factories and moving it. And they're doing it by wheel barrel. The wheel barrel falls and there's like a runway, it's like cement, and wheel barrel falls off and into the mud. And so everybody is like -- other employees are laughing and like just laughing at how helpless this guy is, right -- his employee. And then Mr. Westinghouse sees what happens. He says, "Mr. Westinghouse appeared, in his long-tailed coat and high hat. He removed his gloves, took hold of the wheel, and lifted it onto the slab. He said nothing. It made a lasting impression on me. Here was a boss whose first impulse was to help to set things right and at the same time, to drive home a powerful but unspoken lesson." "They were all working together from top to bottom. George Westinghouse like Edison thought money was important only as a form of stored energy to use as he wishes in his work and expand his businesses. He was interested not in being rich but in helping the world. He strove incessantly to deliver better, more reliable products, but he had another goal also." "My ambition is to give as many persons as possible an opportunity to earn money by their own efforts he once explained. And this has been the reason why I have tried to build up corporations, which are large employers of labor and to pay living wages, large even than other manufacturers pay or that the open labor market necessitates." That is very Ford. Very much -- if you didn't tell me that was a quote by George Westinghouse, I could easily think that was a quote by Henry Ford because all he focused on was service. And that's what Westinghouse is saying he's like, "Listen, I want to make money, but I want to make money as a way to expand the amount of service that I give to other people. And that's the point of the businesses that I'm creating."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I think it's entrepreneurs like we are unbelievably like lucky to be able to do that. Most people don't do that. I was just listening to Arnold Schwarzenegger talk. He talked about like the importance of making a full commitment in whatever you're doing in life, right? And so he's like, see, I don't know where he got the number but he's like 74% of all Americans hate the job that they have. And he's like the reason they hate the job they have because they're just accepting whatever job is available. They didn't actually sit down and think, what do I want to do in my life? What do I believe in? And for Arnold, it's like, "I want it. I made a full commitment to become Mr. Universe" -- winning of the bodybuilding content. "And then when I was done that. I mean a full commitment to become a movie star. Even though everybody told me no, you're silly, people can't even understand your accent, et cetera, et cetera." And then when he has done that, he said, "I made a full commitment to being in politics." He said, "I knew my why, and I centered that." And everybody says, like you can't even pronounce the state of the -- that you want to be governor of. He is like it doesn't matter. Like I made the full commitment. I believe this. He was a missionary in every single endeavor that he did. I don't know. I think that you see that with Westinghouse, you see with Tesla, you see with Edison. You see with all of them. It's extremely important to be -- to make yourself aware of that and then spend some time thinking about like how does this apply to my own life. All right, so this is Edison on Westinghouse, and this is the beginning of the war of the currents. So Thomas Edison already has a successful DC company, I say successful in my quotes because these are capital-intensive businesses. They have to take on high levels of financing, high levels of debt and there's all kinds of like global financial panics that cause them to -- in many cases, like had to reorganize, raise more money, and go bankrupt. These are -- so they're successful in the sense that they're spreading the product, but financially, not so much. "Thomas Edison smoked his cigar and stewed, deeply incensed to learn that Westinghouse Electric Company was invading the field of incandescent lighting. Westinghouse was altogether another matter," meaning there's a lot of other people that like little companies that try to pop up, and in some cases, even infringe on Edison's patents, but you never had an adversary like the same level of quality of person as Westinghouse.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He says, "Westinghouse altogether another matter, a formidable rival with immense achievement and access to major capital. He was not a man to scoff at, deride or dismiss. The Pittsburgh industrialist was reputed to be a real fighter who once decided, pursued a course of action full bore." In other words, he makes full commitment to what he's going to do. "Whatever new project he launched, he was looking to be the best. Like Edison, he thoroughly enjoyed working in the noisy dirty shops among his men inquiring about the state of their projects and infusing everyone with his own zest. Here, we're the first angry rumblings in the coming hostilities that would become to known as the war of the electric currents." Okay. So this is -- there's one thing that's very confusing because once -- at the very beginning, everybody okay, DC makes easy. Then once AC is Westinghouse start installing them, he grows extremely fast. People will realize, "Oh, wait, this is like a better option." Edison was extremely stubborn and he kind of ignored what was obvious, and I don't know why it was confusing to me to the point where he even bought -- there was like European companies that were developing AC motors and stuff at the same time and AC systems. And he even bought an option for one of their systems, but then he refuse to use it. So he could sold like -- he starts getting outsold later on by -- even then he had a head start by Westinghouse's AC system, and he just never did it. And so like my question I wrote down myself is like, why stay with the DC system, given its location shortcomings, right? It says, somebody worked -- this is quote from somebody worked for Edison. He says, "Edison genuinely fear that poorly design and installed AC systems would impede the broad adoption of electric power. That's what he stated reason was.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"One suspects a further cause stubborn pride of authorship. Every aspect of the Edison DC system have been created from scratch by Edison or his colleagues. It is easy to imagine him bulking and incorporating the inventions of others." So in other words, like what the authors suggesting here is his ego, right? And I think that's very important because all -- like the idea that you're going to accomplish something great without a deep-seated belief in yourself, it's just -- that's -- of course, you have this deep belief in yourself. Now sometimes it's called ego, sometimes obviously, it can be taken too far. And in this case, I think Edison definitely took it too far. But I bring that up because it's inevitable that we all have the same blind spots in our life. And just realizing when you see -- I guess my point is like you can see -- it's a lot easier to identify flaws in other people than it is in ourselves. And just knowing that, okay, that person has flaws, undoubtedly, I have flaws. Where are they? What am I papering over? What am I ignoring? What is my ego not allowing me to see because it could cause dire financial in terms of business like dire financial consequences for yourself. It definitely did for Edison. Edison would have been -- I mean, you still did relatively well financially for himself. He has a lot of other inventions and other businesses, but he could -- I mean he was the first one in the field. He owned the freaking patent for the light bulb. If he had just gone with -- I don't want to step over my point, but I guess it's not like this is like a brand new. I mean, this happened 150 years ago, but he winds up like GE, General Electric, that came -- that was a forced merger, which I'll talk about later on the podcast between Edison and another AC company. And it was forced by J.P. Morgan actually. General Electric is still around today. But -- so he's going to be forced into doing something he doesn't want to do.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But if he had just adopted it earlier, like he could have -- it was his for the taking, imagine being at the very, very beginning of one of the most important industries ever created, ever. And not fully taking advantage of that opportunity that once in a 1,000-lifetime opportunity because of ego -- worrying about ego or authorship or having to incorporate -- because remember, Edison didn't look at himself like an entrepreneur, he looked at himself like an inventor. So it's going to be hard for him to say, like, "Oh, wait, this person invented something better than I did." Now an entrepreneur -- if you were an entrepreneur, you were like, "Oh, no, I don't care. Like I'm -- that's a better option. Let me go and let me -- that's way better. That's a better product. Let me adapt to that." So it's frustrating. There's a lot of parts in this book, where I was just like Edison, come on man. So this idea of businesses that create FUD, fear, uncertainty and doubt against their competitors, very common, very old tactic. This is Edison creating FUD against Westinghouse. He says, and he's trying to -- he hits on this idea that AC current is deadly that you're going to kill everybody. He says, "The quickest, most painless death can be accomplished by the use of electricity and the most suitable apparatus for the purpose is the class of dynamo-electric machine, which employs intermittent currents," that's AC. "The most effective of those are known as alternating machines manufactured principally in this country by George Westinghouse." So he's directly attacking Westinghouse here. "The passage of the current from these machines through the human body, even by the slightest contacts, produces instantaneous death." It's a hell of a way to compete. Saying if you use my competitor's product, you're going to die. "He latched out publicly issuing what surely stands as America's longest and most splenetic howl of corporate outrage, an 84-page Edison diatribe."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He basically wrote a book -- a small book on this and it was called WARNING! "It served as the first official public salvo in the most unusual and caustic battles in American corporate history. Edison with his DC system was making his first open attack against Westinghouse and AC in the war of electric currents." While Edison and Westinghouse are competing, Tesla is inventing. "As Nikola Tesla returned to his seat, the assembled electricians comprehended uneasily and somewhat resentfully that a new titan had risen unbidden among them, eclipsing much of what they had done, making a relevance many of their dearest labor." So this is the one I was talking about earlier, how Edison -- or excuse me, Tesla would do, these public displays of what he did and they call it -- the author called earlier, quantum leap and that's the -- making these like these AC motors without I think they're called brushless AC electric dynamos actually. But that's a way to like simplify the motors needed to make AC travel long distances. And so this public demonstration becomes extremely famous, everybody is reading about it in the early electric industry like Trade Journals. And so Westinghouse does the opposite of what Edison does, like, oh, this is genius. This guy has already invented something better than what my company has. So he goes and buys it from Tesla. And this is Tesla describing to us what he thought of Westinghouse. He says, "Tesla very much admired Westinghouse's qualities as a businessman. He said once, 'No fiercer adversary than Westinghouse could have been found when he was aroused. An athlete in ordinary life, he was transformed into a giant when confronted with difficulties, which seem insurmountable. When others would give up in despair, he triumphs,'" this is the greatest -- one of the greatest senses in the entire book.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Had he been transferred to another planet with everything against him, he would have worked out his salvation. In my opinion, the only man on this globe who would have taken my alternating system under the circumstances, then existing and win the battle against prejudice and money and power." So he is saying Westinghouse was the only one. So I wrote a note to myself, be a wolf, survive anywhere you were dropped. Because think about what Tesla just told us about Westinghouse. He said, had he been transferred to another planet with everything going against him, he would have worked out a solution. So what I mean about being a wolf and surviving anywhere you drop, I use podcasts a lot to learn about what I would consider like just completely different lives to my own, right? And so I listened to this outdoor podcast by an author, and podcaster, and TV host name Steven Rinella, it's called MeatEater. It's very fascinating because I know nothing about like the natural outdoors. I don't hunt, I don't know anything. Like I just -- it's like a foreign world to me and it's so weird when I think about it because like most of human existence was much closer to like Steve Rinella's existence than my own, right, where I live in a city, deal with -- like we have the Internet. We have all these like we do -- we got -- we basically built our own world within our -- the natural world, right? That's kind of separate from it. And so I wind up in like -- and Steve is like a student of history who goes and talks about like how different species exist. And he is just -- I find his podcast fascinating because it's a world I'll never probably exist in. So I was listening to, and he interviews a lot of like -- I guess the U.S. government has a lot of like people working for them to have that manage like wildlife populations and like the national parks and all the other stuff.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I was listening to one where they had to move around. They track and monitor like how much of any given animal is in an area and like to make sure they don't go extinct, right? And what happens is they were talking about how they had to move -- I don't remember the name. Let's just say it was an elk, right? So they have to move elk population, a couple of hundred miles and you do that, they have like, let's say, a small group of like 100 and you build this huge fenced-in area, right? The fence is so big, they can't even see the fence. And eventually, you keep removing parts of the fence. So over months and months and months, eventually, like you're easing them into it, where like they -- you relocate them to an area. They have food and water and things they need to survive. And then eventually, you remove pieces of fence, and they start expanding out. And as they expand out the population increases. And so you have these pods of elks. I don't know what they're called, the group of elks are called. But in the environment they were just moved from, they're still growing, and now this new environment they're still growing. So basically splitting them up and now that allows them to create more, right? And so it was like interesting that they had to like be so protective of them because there are so many things that hunt them. And then Steve or somebody else in the podcast says, they're like, "Oh, you've done this with the wolf population in the America like Northwest, right? And you've moved them, do you have to do the same" -- and he was asked question like, you have to do the same process, where you like set up this huge fenced-in area, where there's food and everything else? And the guy's response, I'll never forget, he's like, "No." He said, you can drop wolves anywhere and they'll immediately start surviving. Like basically, they're infinitely adaptable over hundreds of thousands if not millions of years to do what they're put on the planet to do. And I think there is an analogy there for entrepreneurs. I always talk about how I learned a lot from like if you listen to the words of, I think, like entrepreneurship and Hip-hop have a lot of like similarities.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And there's this -- Jay-Z has a line that came out like 15 years ago or 20 years ago that I always think about. And he says, "Put me anywhere in God's green earth and I'll triple my worth," meaning like he will understand like how to identify opportunities. And he's basically saying like in that scenario, he's the wolf. It doesn't matter where you drop me. I'll figure it out and I will thrive. I'll figure out what resources are there. I figure out how to get what I need, I'll figure how to combine those resources and to make them more valuable over time, and that's all you're really doing when you're building a product or doing a business. So I think in this case, going back to Tesla's quote, "Had he been transferred to another plant with everything against him, he would have worked out a salvation," be a wolf, survive anywhere you're dropped. Westinghouse is going to survive anywhere you drop him. Okay, Westinghouse just has a lot of good like personality traits that I want to focus on. So they're having this bitter battle. They don't even know each other. And Westinghouse is like this is stupid. So in the middle of war, Westinghouse just writes Edison a personal letter. So he wrote a personal note at Thomas Edison. And he's like, "I want to propose peace here. He says, I believe there has been a systematic attempt on the part of some people to do a great deal of mischief and create as great a difference as possible between the Edison Company and the Westinghouse Electric Company, where there ought to be an entirely different condition of affairs." So he is like, let's just talk this out. We don't have to do this. We don't have to like -- there's plenty of room for everybody in the business. And I think Edison rebuffed him, so it didn't work out. But I think about any time that I've had like personal conflict, there's something very human. When you -- let's say, you have a fight with a friend or a business associate, anybody else, like I think it gets really -- it makes it a lot worse if you just stop talking or ignore it. And sometimes you have to take a step back, let's -- let time like get everybody calm down. But almost every other time, you can just like, "Listen, let's just sit down and talk about this man, this is stupid. Let's figure out why we're having a problem and let's just come to some kind of solution." I think this personal touch is extremely important in human endeavor.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Heinrichs runs up to Westinghouse's office. He's p***** off. He's like, and he's burst in the door, "Can you believe this is happening?" And this is Westinghouse. He's saying, "He saw that Heinrichs was agitated and what he was clutching, the newspaper. The Pittsburgh industrials cocked his great head and asked Heinrichs, 'Well, what's the hurry?'" And then Heinrichs says, "Don't you think we ought to say something against these slanders and false statements? Heinrichs would always remember how Westinghouse eyed him for a few seconds. Westinghouse smiled, 'Heinrichs, they tell me you're quite a whist player.'" Whist is like something like bridge, some kind of like game. "Is that so? Heinrichs admitted a fondness. 'Well, then you know the meaning of the expression, don't play the other fellow's game.' Heinrichs found this thought puzzling. What did the game whist have to do with Edison?" "Westinghouse explained, 'Now seriously speaking, all this opposition to the alternating current is doing our business a great deal of good.'" We are -- he's understanding there's no such thing as bad publicity. "We are getting an invaluable amount of free advertising as a practical commercial proposition, the alternating current system is so far superior to the direct current that there's really no comparison. By keeping up this agitation about the deadly alternating current, they are playing our game, and we are taking the tricks." "They hope that by their power, their influence, they can accomplish the rest of the march of progress. This, by the very laws of nature, cannot be done. As to the attacks made against me personally, of course, they heard, but my self-respect and conscious do not allow me to fight with such weapons," meaning he knows that he's on the right.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Because I feel that my moral reputation and my business reputation are too well established to be hurt by such attacks. By letting others do all the talking, we shall make more friends in the end that if we lower ourselves to the level of our assailants." I mean I don't know how -- you can come away from this reading this book or listening to this podcast with a lot of respect from for the mind and philosophy of George Westinghouse. So one of the ways that Edison decides to fight the war is by trying to get the time in New York State -- or might be New Jersey. Let's say it's New York is saying, "We're going to outlaw. They have the death penalty." They don't want to hang people anymore. So they're asking people to come up with different like more humane ways of killing people. And they come up with the idea of the electric chair. And so Edison wanted to -- he was contacted as like an expert on electricity. So he says, "Oh, yes, perfect thing to kill people is Westinghouse's machines." And this is more evidence that there's no such thing as bad publicity because they're using these machines to kill people. And he says, "Despite Edison's war against alternating current, the month of September in 1890, soon after the first botched electrocution." So they use the machine. They think the guy is dead after like 12 seconds, they pronounce him dead and then he comes back to life. He was never really dead, obviously. And so they keep electrocuting him. It was like a very gross and like public spectacle and made news everywhere, right? So that's what they mean by botched electrocution. At the exact same month this happened, there was a banner sales month for Westinghouse Electric Company. "In 4 short years since it was established, total annual sales soared from $150,000 a year to more than $4 million." So he's clearly winning this war. Now, he's doing a lot of sales, but he has a lot of debt. These are capital-intensive businesses, like I said earlier.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so there's 2 or 3 great recessions, if not depressions that happen during this time. And they -- sometimes they start overseas, and they spread to America. Sometimes they start in America, that's spread elsewhere, like many banking crises tend to do. And so at this point, he needs a lot of money to pay off all debt because they're calling in loans because a lot of these banks are having runs on the banks, and they need money to have to satisfy their depositors. So this is another example that if you're going to do anything great, you have to -- you need a lot of pigs. What I referenced earlier, Jim Clark's idea. And so he's trying to raise money, the bankers are seeing an opportunity of weakness. So they try to like -- they're like, "Oh yes, we're going to give you money, but we want to make sure that your company is properly managed, okay?" So this is Westinghouse forcing them to change from being chickens to pigs. "The phrase properly managed reflected an ominous turn of events. But leaving Westinghouse cornered one of the bankers saw an easy chance to gain partial control of this highly valuable industrial property. He said to his colleagues, 'Mr. Westinghouse wastes so much on experimentation'" -- how ridiculous does that, "and pay so liberally for whatever he wishes in way of service and patent rights. That we are taking a pretty large risk if we give them a free hand with the fund, he has asked us to raise." "We ought to at least know what he is doing with our money. When the bankers demanded a voice in management, Westinghouse explained in a general and pleasant way that this was impossible. He had always run his own companies, they were flourishing before this immediate need to pay off eclectic creditors, and he had no intention of being second-guessed or told what to do." "The 2 sides went back and forth at some length until Westinghouse said he must have an answer. Either they were providing a loan, no strings attached or they were not. So they said, 'they won't.' To their astonishment, instead of being staggered, he rose with a smile, remarking. 'Well, thank God, I know the worst at last.' It was not Westinghouse, imperturbable as ever who was shaken, but the overreaching bankers."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Westinghouse told several jokes, bade the silent bankers good day, and left the room. They had just witnessed the disserving famous Westinghouse courage." So he goes and he finds other financers. And he's like, my business is good. You can look at the numbers. We just raised a lot of debt like -- and obviously, most businesses he shouldn't be doing that. In the case of what they're actually inventing in this case, it might probably it sounds to be -- had to be like there was no other way. And he winds up finding people who he capitalizes as the company. This happens to him actually twice. And at the very end, like 25 years, 20 years in the future from where we're at now, maybe a little less. They wind up successfully bankrupting the company and installing like -- I wouldn't say adult supervision because these guys are like 50 years old at that time, but they do make them have management and he winds up leaving the company. I'll talk more about that later. But before he recapitalizes, he also has to -- he goes to Tesla. And he's like, "Listen, I had a disagreement with you. You get royalties" and this -- Tesla basically gives up the royalties to save Westinghouse. And here's -- I'm going to read to you a description of how this event happens. And it's kind of -- it's sad from Tesla's perspective because he didn't have a lot of money, then he has a huge success, it makes a little bit of money. And he wanted -- this decision he's going to make right here is going to wind up costing them close to $20 million. And he needed that later in life. He did not have a good later life. So their meeting, he says, "Elaborated upon the crisis and asked Tesla to repudiate his contract and forgo his patent royalties. Tesla described as critical episode in his own life. Your decision said Westinghouse, determines the fate of the Westinghouse company. Tesla says, 'Suppose I should have refused to give up my contract, what would you do then?'"

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Westinghouse replies, 'In that event, you would have to deal with the bankers for I would no longer have any power in the situation.' 'And if I give up the contract, you will save your company and retain control, so you can proceed with your plans to give my polyphase system to the world?' Westinghouse replies, 'I believe your polyphase system is the greatest discovery in the field of electricity,' Westinghouse explained." "It was my efforts to give it to the world that brought on the present difficulty, but I intend to continue no matter what happens to proceed with my original plans to put the country on an alternating current basis. 'Mr. Westinghouse,' said to Tesla, 'You have been my friend, you believed in me when others had no faith, you were brave enough to go ahead and pay me. When others lack courage, you supported me when your own engineers lacked vision to see the big things ahead what you and I saw, you have stood by me as a friend. The benefits that will come to civilization from my polyphase system mean more to me than the money involved.'" "'Mr. Westinghouse, you will save your company so you can develop my inventions. Here's your contract and here is my contract. I will tear both of them to pieces and you will no longer have any troubles from my royalties. Is that sufficient?'" That's a hell of a level of dedication that Tesla had to bringing electricity to the world. I think our goal should be to work in an industry that excites us like electricity excited Tesla. Here's an example of that. Tesla understood that many branded him a visionary for his deep belief in time, that in time, energy would be easily extracted from the universe around us. He pointed out, "We are whirling through endless space with an inconceivable speed, all around us, everything is spinning. Everything is moving, everywhere is energy. There must be some way of availing ourselves of this energy more directly than with the light obtained from that medium with the power derived from it with every form of energy obtained without effort from the store ever exhaustible," that's an interesting way to describe it, "Humanity will advance with giant strides."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"The mere contemplation of those magnificent possibilities expands our minds, strengthens our hopes, and fills our hearts with supreme delights, with that, Tesla bowed modestly instead beaming as the audience rose to its feet and thunderously clapped in amazement at what they had just seen and heard." So this is one of his world-famous demonstrations of new inventions that he was making at the time too. This is the beginning where Edison is going to be starting to be forced to merge. "Westinghouse's determined quest for money continued. Thomas Edison might well have been gained great pleasure from Westinghouse's financial woes, where he not much in the same predicament." That's what I meant about. These are businesses that created unbelievable values to the world. But as far as profit at this point in time, not so much. "The previous summer's reorganization," meaning they had to raise pay off debt too, so they reorganized, "Was not after all such a great arrangement." So the Edison Electric Company is being -- the President is -- this guy name Villard. He said, "Villard was well aware from his previous efforts to merge Edison's company with rival firms that Thomas Edison bristled at such talk. The inventor had angrily dismissed the notion that mergers would solve new problems. As for merging with Thomson-Houston, that was absolute anathema. Edison has already denounced its men for having boldly appropriated and infringed every patent we use." "Moreover, Edison fervently believed that were he to combine with any of his hated rivals, his inventive fertility would drive up. If you make the coalition, my usefulness as an inventor is gone. My services wouldn't be worth a penny. I can only invent under powerful incentive. No competition means no invention." But here's a problem with this. He doesn't want to merge, but he only held 10% of his own company's stock. "Villard once again began secretly talking to Charles Coffin." This is the former shoe salesman whose business brilliance had steadily forged Thomson-Houston into a major electrical power.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So they continue talking. Villard goes to J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan was one of Edison's first financiers. And they do something here I couldn't even imagine what this is going to -- what this felt like. They're going to merge the company and they don't even tell Edison. They don't even tell him. They do it because they control everything, so they just do it and then he finds out secondhand. It says, "And it was so that J.P. Morgan whose house had been the first in New York to be wired for electricity by Edison, but a decade earlier, now erased Edison's name out of corporate existence without even the courtesy of a telegram or a phone call to the great inventor." So what they mean by that is a new merged company, they dropped Edison's name and they just call it General Electric. And they had to do this because, obviously -- I mean, you didn't have to do it that way. I think that's terrible. It's just not good at all, like interpersonal human relations, I mean, but they had to do this because DC was getting its a** kicked. AC had won the war and Edison was refusing to give up. So now the combined company controls 75% of the market, and they sell both DC and AC systems. And at this point, effectively the war for electric current was over. AC has won. I do want to update -- there is -- well, I'm going to tell you more individually about the lives of Westinghouse, Edison, and Tesla after the end of the war because obviously, now it's just the beginning of a whole new industry.

So let's talk about Westinghouse after the war. And this is somebody that worked for him, and he says, "I've never met a human being who could keep track and direct as many things simultaneously as him. He had farsightedness that it was almost uncanny to me. Every new idea was almost immediately analyzed by him and acted upon before you realize what was in his mind." "As Westinghouse traveled relentless say, among his many businesses, he continued his lifelong practice of seeking out brilliant inventors or engineers, buying their patents and then collaborating with them to create better industrial version." So it's kind of his MO how he started all those companies. When he was younger, he invented himself. And then later on, he would just partner with them. Some philosophy on life, just some random things, now gets wisdom. I think we can learn from Westinghouse and apply our own lives. And they're saying, "How can you go to sleep after such a busy day," and he goes, "I never think of the past, I go to sleep thinking only of what I'm going to do tomorrow. With this constant forward thinking, Westinghouse squandered no mental energy on what might have been."

So this is the part of the story where there's another financial panic. This is in the early 1900s now, and this is where he's going to lose his company. And I just want to read the part like how he responds to it. It's -- again, there's a lot of things in life that are going to happen to us. So most of which are not out of -- or most of which are not under our control, but we can control how we react to this. And he's having this conversation when this really sad and unnerving day, and he's talking to the Heinrichs guy, the guy that was doing is PR and he wants to get the word out to the press about what's going on. And this is Westinghouse. He says, "Do not forget to make it very emphatic to them that this receivership is not the end of the company. The company is fundamentally sound and solid as ever," at the time they're doing like, I don't know, like $30 million in revenue. They just have a lot of debt. "The company is fundamentally sound and solid as ever, and it will emerge at this unfortunate situation a greater and more prosperous concern than ever." He's actually right about that. "The bankruptcy was a great shock to both insiders and outsiders but with money so tight, Westinghouse saw no alternative. He treated it as a matter-of-factly. I grant to you," -- and this is the part I want you to remember and internalize for your own life. "I grant you, this is not pleasant. He told one friend. But it isn't the biggest thing in the world." "All large businesses, I would say, all businesses have its ups and downs." This sentence is super important. "The crisis through which we are passing is only part of our day's work." In remaining column, he's realizing, "Hey, there's going to be ups and downs, and I just got to work my way through it." So they bring in this other guy named Robert Mather, want to push him off the Board correct -- entirely, but then they want him to come back.

And he says, "They made various lukewarm overtures to bring the great industrialist back into some kind of active management, but he disagrees with their whole corporate philosophy." This is another thing I think we can learn from him. "He saw himself as interested in progress and profits and the welfare of his men, while they were only interested in profits." "The loss of his electric company was accrual blow, but Westinghouse was at heart, an optimist, a doer, and a builder. He still had his 4 other major American companies and his insatiable desire to improve the world," and he was an entrepreneur till the day he died. At a time when many Americans had come to view the nation's industrialists and financiers has as little better than robber barons, Westinghouse was a notable exception. This is how he was viewed, "An honest industrious who sold the best product for the best price, who relish competition and valued his workers, and who deserved his hard-earned fortune." So when he dies, he winds up having like thousands of his employees coming out to its funeral. And I think this is just an important thing. He -- one lesson he taught everybody in his time. He says, "A corporation can have a soul." This is the last quote from Westinghouse in the book. And this is "One day towards the end of his life, he was on a train whose air brakes helped avert a derailment at a bad track washout." So he turns to the person next to him. He says, "If someday they save me that with my work, I've contributed something to the welfare and happiness of my fellow men, I should be satisfied." So I love that. That's the -- like the Northern Light -- the North Star, rather. That guided him, he was like I just want to contribute something to the welfare and happiness of my fellow men and of course, capture some of that. Edison was distraught after General Electric reform.

He said, "You know what, I'm going to work on something so big that they will forget that I was ever associated with the electric industry." Winds up doing like -- spending years and a lot of money on this failed iron ore business, but he goes on and creates -- surprisingly, the movie business. So it says, "Edison had set up a primitive movie studio. And by 1904, with the Edison studios, they made a movie called The Great Train Robbery, did early movies begin to move beyond skits to real stories. This was a revelation, soon copy by others flocking to the business." And there's all these other machines and inventions that were basically in the early motion picture industry. And he went to consulting this. He said -- he had a bunch of -- to be like standard for the industry Edison operating was a lot of patent wars. But he wins, like he won the light bulb patent war. Long drawn out patent wars, he emerged triumphed as a holder of the key motion picture patents in 1907. So he sets up this thing called the Motion Picture Patents Company, which was essentially a movie trust. It guaranteed fees worth $1 million a year to Edison. How crazy is that? "When one former colleague expressed concern to Edison about his financial status, he wrote back cheerfully. My 3 companies, the Phonograph Works, the National Phonograph Company, and the Edison Manufacturing Company, which makes motion pictures, and machines, and films are making a great amount of money, which gives me a large income." "So as he turns 60, Edison was flourishing. While Westinghouse had become a great industrialist, building even bigger and heavier machines, Edison was almost unwillingly developing a whole other sector of the American economy, one that was far less capital intensive and far more glamorous, the entertainment industry." So winds up working out for him in the end. He didn't get nearly what he wanted out of the electrical industry, but he took that, didn't give up, and kept going.

Tesla, unfortunately, did fair -- I would say, worse out of both Westinghouse and Edison, and this is a little bit of Tesla. "His dreams were big far beyond the imaginings of his peers and very expensive. Tesla's idealistic and generous renunciation of its AC royalties was beginning to haunt him." "At $2.50 per horsepower, one can quickly calculate that Tesla had nobly forfeited a princely and heartbreaking sum of $17.5 million in royalties," and that's just the American induction motors at the time they've generated 7 million horsepower that he gave up. So he would have made more than that, assuming he would have got the patents in Europe as well. And I'll close on this. "To this day, Nikola Tesla remains a brilliant but enigmatic figure, a scientist, inventor, dreamer, and visionary." He did find patrons later in his life, which a lot live in -- like he lived his investors' life in New York City, lived in hotels and whatever the case was, but he did not have a lot of money. "Electricity had," -- so it says, "To this day, he remains a brilliant but enigmatic figure, a scientist, inventor, dreamer, and visionary. Electricity had created many, many millionaires but Tesla, who made possible the electric age was never one of them. Still, he did live to see his AC systems straddle the globe," remember that was his original goal "Illuminating nation after nation empowering millions of motors. Almost 60 years after he stepped shore New York dreaming a big dream of electrifying the world, the dream had more to come to pass." I will leave the story here. As you can see from the length of this podcast, I had a lot of notes. There's a lot -- I really, really enjoyed this book. When it was over, I felt like I always talked about that feeling. When you get to the end of a great book. There's this weird melancholic. I don't know even the name of the feeling. It's like you're very satisfied you got to the end, but very sad at the same time that it ended.

If you're ready to do what they've done and what they showed you with their actions, they thought it was a good idea, which is to continue to study, entrepreneurs that came before you, more importantly, learn from entrepreneurs that came before you, you're missing out. You're missing half of the episodes that have done by not signing up for the Misfit feed. So the value that you'll get is incalculable. The value of ideas that people have spent their entire lives figuring out that you can then just download into your brain and very quickly. It's worth -- who knows what these ideas will be worth over your lifetime as you continue to dedicate your time and effort into whatever you're working on, whatever craft that you're pursuing. So please, support -- again, that's another thing where you're supporting yourself. You're supporting me and allowing me to spend all the time that it takes to make these. And I still -- I don't know if there's another podcast on the planet that's coming out on a weekly basis that prepares more than I do. Having to read hundreds of pages taking notes, going back and looking and trying to make something that, one, that hopefully you find entertaining, but because I think entertainment is the way -- it's like the Trojan Horse, make this entertaining and at the same time, you'll learn a lot. So please, if you've learned from my work and you value my work, consider doing that and I really greatly appreciate it. So you know where to get the books, you know where to get the Misfit feed. I mentioned earlier, if you leave a review, how to do that. And if you want, I'll leave a link. I take a lot of notes on talks about entrepreneurs. So if you want to -- like I'll leave the link. I'm going to leave the link for the Jeff Bezos one because his idea is on comparing and contrasting the Internet industry with the electrical industry, I think it's important, especially because we are in the very beginning of this Internet revolution that we're living and that's affecting all areas of our life. And Jeff is one of the smartest people have ever come across. And he just -- the way he thinks about things. And his presentation was just fantastic. Now I read my notes, I'll link to the whole -- in the notes I linked to the whole talk, and it's worth 18 or 20 minutes it takes to watch it. So please tell your friends about the podcast. Thank you very much for listening. Thank you very much for your support, and I will be back next week with another biography about an entrepreneur.

“Chuck Feeney felt a profound sense of relief. He had flown into the Bahamas that morning an extremely rich man; now he was flying out with a little more to his name than when he had started out on his various business ventures 3 decades earlier. He celebrated having divested himself personally of the vast wealth with which fate and his genius for making money had burdened him. It was all done with the utmost secrecy. “Few outside the small group that gathered that day in the Bahamas would know what had taken place for a long time to come. Four years later, Forbes magazine listed Feeney as the 23rd richest American alive, declaring him to be a billionaire with $1.3 billion. But Forbes had got it wrong and would continue to repeat this mistake for many years afterward. Chuck Feeney had gotten rid of it all. He was the billionaire who wasn't.”

That was an extract from the book that I'm going to talk to you about today, which is the Billionaire Who Wasn't. How Chuck Feeney secretly made and gave away a fortune and it was written by Conor O'Clery. This is another book that I did not -- I wasn't aware of. It was actually recommended to me by a listener. Before I read the book, I actually watched a documentary, it's available on YouTube about Chuck Feeney. And there's a few notes that I wrote down. I just want to tell you before we jump into the book because I think watching the documentary helped me understand him. Watching the documentary before reading the book actually help me understand who he was. It was very -- he may be the most unique person I've ever studied on Founders. He is very complex and confusing person. Here's a few quotes from documentary about -- from people that knew him or know him. He's still live to this day. So he says, "I can't say I ever encountered such an extraordinary individual." One person described him in one word, "Complex." Another description, "He wanted to play fair, but he wanted to play rough -- excuse me, tough." Another one-word description, "Odd."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This one was really great, "A conversation with Chuck Feeney is unlike any conversation you'll have with anyone on earth." Another one-word description, "Paradoxical," inspiring. Chuck Feeney is a totally one-off. He will know more about you in 20 minutes than you will ever know about him. He's a type A personality. He walked quickly, talked quickly and worked incessantly. Okay, so let's jump into the book. The vast majority of my highlights. I would say 95% of the highlights I made in this book have to do with how he built his business. I found that the most interesting -- this business is going to produce billions and billions and billions -- it's a private company before he sells it to LVMH. It's going to produce billions and billions in cash for the partners. But there are a few stories or anecdotes from his early life that gives us an insight into how he thought that I thought was interesting. So he comes from a very -- like a working-class New Jersey background. He's very uncomfortable. The reason people described him as paradox because he was very gifted in making money, but he was very uncomfortable with keeping money. And so this -- at this point, the story I'm about to tell you right now is he's just graduating high school. He decides to shoot to aim really high, even though no one in his family has gone to college before, he's like, "I want to go to Cornell. I want to go to The Ivy League. He didn't think what was interesting -- the reason I'm bringing this to attention is because he didn't think he’d get into Cornell, but he tried anyways. So it says, "The letter of acceptance was a major event for the Feeneys. No one in the family had ever been to a university. But Feeney was already showing a trait that would assert itself throughout his life: Thinking big and aiming to achieve the best result, even if it seemed unattainable." So it's very important. After he graduated from college, he's with a group of friends, they're traveling in the United States. He has no idea what he's going to do in his life. And this is just a short sentence. But really the way to think about this is that he's always looking for an edge while others slept. And so this is a friend of his, they were all living like this little apartment at that time together, and this is what his friend remembers.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He says, "The three of us would sleep in, but Chuck would go off to summer school in the morning to take lessons in Russian." So he winds up serving the military. "He stays over in Europe. And at this time, he is hitchhiking -- this is another example of the way he just thinks very differently than most people. "He's hitchhiking in France, and he realizes the power of differentiation." So there's a ton of hitchhikers all over Europe at this time, they're holding up signs saying, "Hey, I'm going to Paris. I'm going to Munich," I am going -- essentially advertising where they want you to take them. Now if you haven't listened to last week’s podcast, I highly recommend you do because I can't stop thinking about all the lessons Claude Hopkins taught, but it's specifically his idea that you always have to start with service. I think that book that he wrote was a master class in what incentivizes and what motivates humans. And -- so in his advertising, he always starts with service. We're going to see the same thing -- like we're going to see the same lessons that Claude Hopkins applied in his life writing advertising for companies and everybody else that Chuck is applying to get a ride, okay? So this is, again, a very short less on differentiation. "Getting rides was difficult as there were so many people on the roads holding up handwritten signs to show their destination." So Chuck does something different. He displayed a notice in large letter saying, "English conversations offered." "He had no trouble getting a lift after that." Okay, so at this point in his life, he's 26 years old. He's living in France. He's actually running a summer camp for American kids, has no idea what he wants to do with his life. And this is where an opportunity pops up. This is the opportunity, the kernel of the idea that is going to -- over the course of about 2 decades, making billions and billions of dollars. So it says one night in a bar, he met Bob Edmonds, who was trying to start a business selling duty-free liquor to American sailors at ports around the Mediterranean. He asked Feeney to help him.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The U.S. Navy did not allow the consumption of alcohol on board, but Edmonds had established that sailors could buy up to 5 bottles of liquor duty-free and have them shipped as unaccompanied baggage to their home port. It could be a big market. There were 50 ships in the Mediterranean and the crews were rotated 3 times a year. And this is a value proposition for the customer. Why would -- why can the business grow so quickly because the value that the customer gets is immediately apparent to them. And it says the savings for the military personnel were huge. "A 5-pack bought duty-free in Europe cost $10, while the same 5 bottles in the United States would cost over $30." It's also important to note, as we get going into the story the reason that Feeney doesn’t have a lot of money and his partner, they may have a couple of thousand dollars to their names at this point. But something to keep in mind about the business is there's no need for capital. They did not have to pay for the merchandise in advance. Essentially, they just drop shipping everything. So it says -- let's go back to this conversation with Bob though, we're not there yet, "40 ships are coming in," he told Feeney. "I can only see 20. I'm looking for a guy that can see the other 20. 'What do you mean?' asked Feeney. 'Go and talk to them about buying booze.'" So Feeney was successful, almost immediately. He's not going to work with Bob for very long. He's going to try to do something his own. He travels to Barcelona, and he runs into somebody that also went to Cornell. And this is going to be his long-term partner. And this is Robert Warren Miller. Bob -- everybody calls him Bob Miller and it says, "Miller recognized the wiry blue-eyed American immediately. 'Feeney,' he said, 'What are you doing here?' 'What are you doing here?' replied Chuck. That casual exchange marked the start of one of the most profitable partnerships in international business history," that is a hell of a sentence and it's probably true. When Miller finished his shift that day, he and Feeney went out to dinner. Miller was already bored working in the hotel.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

They decided to throw their lot in together and try to make money from doing business with the U.S. fleet. Miller had already gotten a glimpse of duty-free rackets that were common in post-war Europe. He told Feeney about a Hong Kong priest living in Barcelona who changed U.S. dollars at the black market rate. So one of the most interesting parts -- and I say the vast majority of the book, maybe 60% of the book is all about the charity work that he does later on. I don't have -- I'm excluding most of that from what I want to talk to you about today because I found the building of the business to be more interesting. But what I do like about reading this book is like it's full of international intrigue. Like this business that they set up, it's all over the world. It's in tax havens, they're running across -- it's almost like it's borderline illegal. And so this idea that you're going to run into a priest from Hong Kong, living in Barcelona changing U.S. dollars in black markets. This is funny to me. So anyways, they start on Barcelona and they don't stay there very long. They're going to travel all over the world. They do not stay in many places very long. So this is the very beginning of their business. Feeney and Miller started taking orders for liquor from U.S. naval personnel. They started driving or taking trains to ports all along the Mediterranean. So they're going after -- wherever the ships are, they're going to go there. They would not see each other for weeks, then they would meet back up, agree on what to do next, and go off in different directions. They finally know there's a lot of -- you're going to see a lot of the playbook that he's running when his business is just relegated to selling liquor to ships. He's going to use the same -- a lot of these same ideas in different manifestations because he's eventually going to build this gigantic global retail network. And so one of that is like how do you get -- like how do you get distribution? How do you get customers to know that you exist? And so they call the people that give them information, bird dogs, okay? So there's a little bit about that. They found bird dogs onboard the ships to whom they promised commission for getting sailors to sign up for 5 packs. Now this also gives us insight into Feeney’s really unique mind.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He's not -- they say working with him, he did a lot by like instinct and just -- he calls it as mulling. He would just think about things and try to really go with whatever he felt best -- like felt the best opportunity was. And a lot of that was just making sure that he had the flexibility to take the best path forward. Now, he's going to need that because this is going to work for a while. They're going to make a good amount of money until others start seeing the same opportunity. Just like once Bob knew it, Bob Edmonds knew it, well, then he told it to Chuck. Chuck tells it to Bob Miller. And so this is going to go on and on. So it says, "The booze business has become very competitive. And the 2 look for other things to sell. They got ideas for expanding their inventory. They started adding items such as perfume, cameras, toy trains, and transistor radios. The orders and the money piled up. Feeney boasted to Miller that they were on their way to making $1 million. They called themselves the Young Turks." And so that's one of the wild things to think about. Right now, they're selling just to people in the military, they're just selling liquor, they're excited about having the opportunity to make $1 million. This is a business that by the time -- but if you take out all the dividends that they take out for the 4 partners, Miller and Feeney being the major partners, they owned almost 40% of the company each, and the sale to Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy, they're going to pull out about $8 billion out this company. This is a wild, wild story. I think you're going to like it. Okay, so let me -- we're not there yet. Let me go ahead and tell you what I found interesting is like why is this all working? So in 1950s America, there's a boom going on. So Americans at the time had a lot of disposable income. They like to drink. So they're spending a lot of that on liquor. And this is where Chuck realizes that he doesn't have to only sell to the military. And there's a couple of different points in his life where he realized, just wait a minute. I am artificially constraining my market here. Like this market is a lot bigger than I think anybody actually knows.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I've forgotten this. Like right at the very beginning of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, started e-mailing. He e-mailed 1,000 of the early Amazon customers. And he asked what else they'd like to buy. And one of them replied and said, "I really wish -- I need windshield wiper blades. I really wish that you would sell windshield wiper blades." And Jeff talks about it. He's like, "When I got that e-mail, I realized we can sell anything this way, doesn't just have to be books." And so we're seeing Feeney realize, "Okay, wait a minute, I'm trying to sell you liquor for $10 or $20, you're willing to buy a car that's a couple of thousand dollars, like I can sell anything this way." And -- oh, let me tell you a little bit about -- this is -- it's very exciting, like the early days of a company, especially when it's a group of young people. And really, they're at the right place at the right time with the right set of skills. And he hires, Chuck and Bob hire people that are very similar to themselves. So it says, "Chuck and his team were aggressive, self-confident, and borderline legal. They enjoyed a great sense of camaraderie." So one of the saddest parts about the story is this camaraderie as we've seen over and over and over again, the more money you make, it seems to just -- it eliminates the bond between co-workers and early workers in many cases. And they become, I wouldn't say enemies, but they have no relationship later on. It's one of the saddest parts of the story. But it says, "At this point, they're aggressive, self-confident, and borderline legal and they're having a great sense of camaraderie. The new age of affluence in the United States meant that their American customers had disposable cash and money rolled in. They were in the right place at the right time. The key to their success was that they did not have to maintain inventories. They sold liquor and cars, neither of which required $1 upfront, and the business was offshore, which meant they did not have to pay U.S. taxes." Okay, so they're doing well for a while. This is happening over several years. And what's about to occur, though, is a very important insight for all of us to remember.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this is where he comes up with an idea to expand his market. A lot of this is because he does -- he's constantly sourcing information. He reads. He talks to people. And he realizes, okay, there's a loophole in the duty-free that applies to military, right? As a benefit to being in the military and serving the country, but it also applies to people living in 15 specific states back in the United States. And a lot of these Americans from these 15 states and other states, obviously, are traveling to Europe at this time. And another thing that's helping him is the television advertising is in its infancy at this point. And it's -- there's a lot of ads for liquor to cocktail, stuff like that. So it's really pushing up the demand for liquor. So it says Chuck Feeney discovered one day that these vacationers could buy duty-free booze abroad and bring it home as long as they resided in 1 of 15 American states. They were permitted. This is a loophole, right? They were permitted by U.S. customs to import a 5-pack of liquor once every 31 days without paying any duty. "I all of a sudden realized, s_*_, you can sell this to anybody, anywhere,” said Feeney. “It didn’t matter where you bought it or where you shipped it from," that’s also another important point. He could ship it from anywhere that was convenient for him. It didn't have like, let's say, the tourist was in Italy, it didn't have to come from Italy. He could be shipping from Geneva. He could ship it from Hong Kong, ship it from Canada and Mexico and so he builds this gigantic network. It's really, really fascinating. It didn't matter where you bought or where you shipped it from as long as you declare it when you got back to United States. "Feeney printed up tens of thousands of brochures to tell American tourists traveling in Europe that they could buy duty-free liquor from Tourists International." That is the name of the company, the very -- the beginning of the incarnation of this company that Miller and Feeney are going to operate. They are going to ditch this later on, and I'm going to tell you why and how that came about. So they could buy duty-free liquor from Tourists International and have it shipped to their doorstep. And why are they doing it? Same reason the people on board are doing it. A 5-pack -- this is just one example, a 5-pack of Seagram's VO would cost $47.75 in New York, but it could be bought from Tourists Internationals for $22.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So quite a bit of saving, over 50% there. At this time, Feeney feels like he's stumbling on to this great idea. Then one day he is shocked, right? He finds this beautiful -- beautifully printed brochure that he is advertising, it's not -- selling liquor, but it's advertising a bunch of other duty-free merchandise to American vacationers in Europe. So he's like, "Oh, wow, I got to go meet these guys. Maybe I can do a deal with them." And this is what he says, "Feeney believed this company was way ahead of the game. But he thought -- now this is the name of the company. This is the company -- he's going to buy this company. I'm not going to bury the lead here. And this company is eventually going to make him a billionaire, but not in its present incarnation. They actually go bankrupt and make a series of mistakes. So let's get into that now. "Feeney believed this company was way ahead of the game. He thought they might agree to insert his liquor brochures into the next catalog if they weren't selling booze themselves." So he calls them up, he says, "He was surprised when the manager answered the telephone himself and invited him to come over right away." Duty-Free Shoppers, that's the name of the company, it's a - that's the name of -- it's going to be the name of Feeney’s company moving forward or a few years away from that though. "Duty-Free Shoppers was a brainchild of Stewart Damon. He was a U.S. Navy exchange officer who had been based in Naples, Italy. Its goal was to sell duty-free goods to American tourists abroad. He and his partner, Harry Adler had persuaded investors to put up $95,000 and they arranged for manufacturers to package and ship their products." So they're drop-shipping too. "They printed 0.5 million catalogs and opened an office in Geneva, Switzerland to process what they expected would be an avalanche of orders. Only a trickle came in. On the day Feeney turned up, Adler was paying overdue bills and clearing out his desk. It was his last day of business. Not knowing the dire straits of the company, Feeney told him that he thought this idea was tremendous and was surely very successful and proposed to Adler that if they inserted his liquor brochures in their next catalog."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And we're going to get to the huge mistake that Adler and Damon had made in 1 second. So it says, "If they inserted his liquor brochures in the next catalog, he would give them commission on all liquor orders that resulted." And this is what Adler said, "The irony of it all. Here was a fellow who thought that the idea could not fail and was coming to us to help him distribute his cockamamie flyers. I really had no choice but to be honest, 'Dear friend,' I said, 'Our distribution was a huge one-time gamble -- that's the mistake right there. And it is at this time, a dismal failure.'" They raised money on one -- printing all their brochures and mailing them out. They used all the money on that one shot. And they assumed that -- again, the -- I don't even know if they had any experience running businesses before whatever the case was. They're like, "Okay, well, sure it's going to work." And as the author just said, the sales trickled in. So now they're closing up shop. Feeney was visibly shocked. They also saw 2 different approaches. I didn't even think about this when I read this, but now I'm just re-reading it for the second time. I think about what -- so Feeney, his partners so with no money, but they started distribution first, okay? Well, we know that -- Feeney at least served in the military, I don't think Miller did. "Okay, so I know how to get on ships, I know how to talk to sailors. I know what's the chance. I just go there and I start with sales, right? We know that I can get distribution -- or excuse me, I can get product easily, but I need to sell distribution first." These guys did reverse. They just assumed mailing our catalogs was efficient -- was going to be good enough for distribution. It's very interesting. All right, go back to this. So it says, "Feeney was visibly shocked, but not at a loss for words. He spoke very fast asking what is to become of this company, these offices and what the orders that were still in the pipeline." Feeney then pulled out a pen and started making copious notes. "Feeney was convinced that the principle is sound and that the company could still survive and thrive with proper marketing, which they failed at, right? Feeney made an offer for up to $10,000 of the company stock." So now he's going to own the limited assets and the name.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He's not going to use that name, I think, for like 4 years away from when he actually is going to switch over and switch not only the name of the company, what the company does and I'll get there in a minute. A little bit about his personality, I thought it was very, very interesting. Feeney came and went. He was always walking fast. He was forever thinking of new ideas. He used to order food and when it arrived, it was hoofed down and we would go. I learned to eat fast. He was always talking, talking, talking. His mind was like Speedy Gonzales. He was always racing. I just always find it's interesting. I thought it was hilarious and reminded me when I read that section about -- when I read the biography Mornings on Horseback about Teddy Roosevelt that he was living at the time in the boarding house and his friend who was living in the boarding house with him, says he always knew who was coming through the door because before he'd hear the door open and before the door shut, Teddy would race up the stairs. He wouldn't walk. He'd been running everywhere. He put a lot of life into 60 short years. Okay, so now let's go back to what Feeney, Miller still selling directly to -- on ships. And this is going to -- this reminded me of an insight that Jeff Bezos said. I'll tell you how I tie this together in a second. "When Feeney and Miller were collecting orders onboard ships, they found themselves being asked if they were the guys who sold cars, they weren't, but they soon were. They discovered the American service personnel abroad also had the right to buy cars duty-free and some rival salesmen had already got in on the act. Miller and Feeney picked brochures from car showrooms and brought them on board the ships. They found that selling cars was just like selling booze," remember that part. "They took a deposit, paid in advance to the car dealer, and ordered the car shipped to the customer's home port. Once they became known as the guys who sold cars, they were overwhelmed with orders." So this is something I forgot, I read Invent and Wander. I think it's like maybe Founders #155, something like that and it’s a collected writing from Jeff Bezos.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And they realizing, in general, it's very -- it's more useful to go where it's less crowded, right? So their business is slowly going to be whittled away on both fronts, the liquor and the car business by competition. So now they have 2 different companies and says, "Cars International and Tourists International were facing ever more stiff competition in Europe." So this is all happening in Europe at this time. "Salesmen flogging everything from cars to perfume and alcohol were elbowing each other out of the way to get onto the U.S. ships. Feeney believed" -- this insight that he has is what's going to make them billions of dollars, okay? "Feeney believed that there could be more lucrative opportunities in the less-crowded Pacific." So his idea is like, why don't we take this duty-free, we know people like buying duty-free things, right? Let's go to the Pacific, let's go to these airports and let's bid -- all the airports would give exclusive -- you could bid on exclusive contracts, right? So you're not going to have 15 duty-free sellers in an airport, usually it’s one. And so at the time, Honolulu in Hawaii is expanding the airport. Chuck decides, "Hey, we're going to bid for this duty-free contract." And this is going to be a very slow road to growth. It starts out very slow and accelerates very fastly, very quickly. But this is going to save this company later down the road. And what is helping -- what's going to help the business grow was some things that are out of his control, like at the point, he's going to build his business off of Japanese tourists, right? And they're flying into Hawaii and what -- one of the things that helped their business grow was that Boeing starts manufacturing the 707 and they start flying that into Hawaii. The -- I don't remember the model plane that flew previously in Hawaii, but the Boeing 707 essentially doubles the amount of passengers per flight, but they doesn't start out like that. So it says the bid guaranteed to pay Honolulu Airport $78,000 for 5 years of the duty-free concession. So this is going -- they have to renew -- these bids are usually 4 years, 5 years, 10 years, they vary in length, but only one person gets the bid.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this is -- I'm not going to bury the point here. They're paying $78,000 for 5 years. Eventually, they'll pay for the same airport, $2 million every 5 years, just to have the right to sell there. I think I got the number right. I have highlights later, but I'm pretty sure it was $2 million for 5 years, $2 million every 5 years. It's wild what's about to happen. Now they were not there. This is May 1962 that they're doing. "It was a huge sum for a tiny retail space in the new terminal, but Feeney and Miller were gambling on the duty-free business picking up as tourism increased." And they're so lucky they did this because their other businesses are going to go -- the other 2 businesses they're having in Europe, they're going to have to retreat. They're going to go out of business. We're not there yet. So let me read my notes here though because this is a very important point. "They didn't know how large this business would turn out to be. They had no idea." At the time, they're having -- there are 2 airports. So it says, "At the time, the 2 airport duty-free concessions were a sideline businesses that might or might not make money. They stock the duty-free shops and appointed managers, but travel in the Pacific was in its infancy and the tiny stores did little business when they opened. Selling cars to the military and liquor to American tourists were still the big money to be made. They were, however, prepared to take chances with whatever opportunities arose." So as the years go on, there's more and more competitors that are coming in and the profits are going to keep decreasing. "We didn't realize when we started this 5-bottle pack business that we didn't have any exclusivity on it. And in no time, there were 15 other companies trying to do the same as what we were doing," said Feeney. This is a description of the early days of the company. "Chuck lived out of his briefcase. Everything was connected with business. We did a lot of s_*_* things. I became part of what he called his teenage frontier approach to business. Chuck surrounded himself with smart college youngsters, mostly single and aggressive.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

They call them aggressive, conquerors of the world. I was the oldest of his cowboys, and I was always dampening -- I was always putting the damper on him, saying to him, 'Are you out of your mind?' but it was a very exciting chapter in my life." Feeney was traveling around so much that he had no permanent address. It's -- well, let me read this quote to you first, "I didn't have a domicile at that stage. It would have been superfluous," he recalled. He really never stops living like this. He kind of is just a wanderer even when he's very wealthy and even after he gives all his money away. He doesn't really stay in any place for very long. So I need to get to the point where they're running into problems. So they're making a good amount of money. Even his competitors come in, obviously numbers are going to drop in a little bit and I'll share that with you. But this is really wild. They're all young. They don't know what they're doing. There's money coming in, coming out. Essentially, what I'm telling you is they have no cash control. And it was interesting, as I read this, I was like, wow, this reminds me of the early days of GM because money -- there was, I think, only 2 profitable companies -- car companies in GM, I think, was Cadillac and Buick. And so they would have to constantly take money from Buick and pay it over here and send it over here. And it was just very -- you just can't believe that one of the most -- one of the largest and most successful companies of all time started out that way, but it did. And so essentially, we're going to see on a much smaller scale, Chuck’s company is doing the same thing. And this is going to get -- they're going to become almost bankrupt. "The company was booming but was chronically short of cash. 'We ain't got no money, boys' Where is the money?' There were severe problems in the auto sales division. They were taking deposits from service personnel and using the money to pay for expenses and car deliveries. The directors were stunned. They thought they had an excess of funds and that it was just moving around the company network. They decided to slash cost and figure out what was going on. 'We had no idea what we were doing financially. If an office was open somewhere, who ever had money sent the money, it was crazy. There was no accounting.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

We send money to Hong Kong or Hong Kong send money to Canada, but there was no tying it together.' With the business expanding so rapidly, they hadn't paid enough attention to bookkeeping. 'We hadn't spent any time on corporate structuring or anything like that. We were just simply busy selling cars, liquor, making cash, putting the cash in the bank, cash in and cash out.'" And the reason I thought it was so humorous because it sounds like a lot like GM. This is how they solved the problem. "They passed around themselves Alfred P. Sloan’s 1963 bestseller, My Years with General Motors." I read that book. That book is on Founders #122. It's one of the most influential books, especially in America at the time like '60s to '70s, a ton of founders and managers that read that book and influence -- it really influenced a lot of the way large companies operate to this day. But it says, "So they passed on this book in which Sloan attributed his success in running GM to decentralize management and financial controls. Tourists Internationals had the former, but not the latter." So they had decentralized management, but they had no financial controls. And then you combine this, all these things are happening at the same time. This is going to lead them onto the precipice of bankruptcy, okay? One of their problems was that the car business -- and this is -- so it's very easy for anybody to sell duty-free liquor, right? But the -- maybe you could say, okay, I could carve out a niche with the car -- like selling cars or higher ticket items, we might be able to make maybe not higher profit margins, but more sales per order, right, not for long. The U.S. military is going to do a deal with car manufacturers and then Feeney realized, I can't compete with this. And so we see this. One of the problems was that the car business was now coming up against serious competition from the U.S. military. They gave showroom space to 3 American car manufacturers, General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, and this is what Feeney said about it. "Of course, they had very attractive deals. You arrived back from your overseas tour and then you went to your local Ford dealer and you picked up your car, which you had ordered in Europe and you didn't have to pay taxes on it. That sort of closes out on that."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

No one's going to -- why am I going to buy from -- I'll just go directly to Ford? Like why would I deal with you guys? And then this is the problem. So at the same time this is happening, his other businesses is being destroyed too. Feeney's mail-order liquor business had been assailed by copycat competitors. It too was in decline. This is wild, imagine running a business and having experiences. They did $20 million in sales in 1963. The next year sales plummeted to $5 million. And this is an example of the old adage, the old maxim when it rains it pours. He's getting it from every angle at the same time. In the mid-summer of 1965, 8 years after founding their company and seeing it expanded to one of the world's first global retailers, Chuck and Bob faced a perfect storm. The company was buffeted by a series of setbacks. President Johnson smashing of the 5-pack business that -- there's a longer story in the book about for some reason, Johnson wanted to get rid of this loophole. The cutthroat rivalry in the Mediterranean, competition in auto sales from car manufacturers, all combined with bad bookkeeping and extensive overspending to provide a classic example of how an innovative business with a visionary leadership can be sunk. There was a deficit of $1.6 million, which is peanuts today, but in those days, was a massive amount of money. They were on the verge of going bankrupt, perhaps already were. Now that happened in 1965, okay? Remember, 1962 is when they had the foresight. Chuck had a foresight, "Hey, why don't we try to go to less crowded" and they started doing that and they won that bid for the Honolulu Airport. And that's where they realized, okay, at this point, they had to start from scratch. Everybody jump ship, everybody left them. It's now back to the 2 original founders. They're going to close down their business, Tourists International. They're going to close down the car business, and they're going to focus on the duty-free stores they have. So it says, "Feeney and Miller were almost back to where they started. Miller recalled telling Feeney, 'Well, Chuck, just you and I now, looks like s_*_ has hit the fan. We've got to get out of this thing.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It's back to you and I to figure out how to do it.' There's still a chance of getting out of the mess, said Feeney. They could perhaps boost the cash flow from the duty-free shops in Hong Kong and Hawaii to clear off the debts. Feeney had moments of despair" and this is him talking about, "Of course. It goes with the territory. But there wasn't much we could do. It was something we had started, and we thought we were going to make a million dollars out of it. We had no choice but to salvage the company or go over the cliff." This is Feeney winds up marrying -- he met a French lady, marries, her name is Danielle. And this is what she was talking about or how she describes Chuck during this crisis. "Danielle Feeney saw change in her husband during the crisis. To her, Chuck had always seemed driven by a desire to succeed. When they got married, he never talked about money, only making a goal of his business ventures. A fortune was not his real goal, she perceived. His work was his challenge. Now she saw his hopes have been shattered and his ego wounded." That's an example, you got to take a negative and turn it to a positive. Yes, he's down. He's depressed. He's wounded, but it also could be super motivating. I don't like the state of my life right now. So I will work really hard to change it, right? So it says. "Feeney and Miller, they wind up figuring out the best path forward. Feeney and Miller drop the names, Tourists International, Cars International. Now that since they were reduced to the retail ventures, they adopted the name that Feeney had bought. They would now be known as Duty Free Shoppers." So let's go to the beginning of their business that's going to -- it's going to start small, but it's not going to start -- to stay that way. This description of this store in Hawaii, they're eventually going to pay Hawaii over $1 billion for this concession, listen to how it starts. "The duty-free shops at Honolulu International Airport when Chuck arrived to run it in late 1965 was more -- a little more than a market stall. Its floor area was just over 100 square feet. It had 3 4-foot counters that were held together with Scotch tape." So Chuck is also in the right place at the right time because this is where Hawaii is starting to experience this huge influx of Japanese tourists.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So not only are the numbers of Japanese tourists going to increase, but there is domestic tax policy decisions in Japan that benefited Chuck’s business. So it says, "The Japanese were genuinely astonished at the duty-free prices. Because of a policy of protectionism, Japan levied a 220% tax on imported premium cognac and whiskey. In Tokyo, a bottle of whiskey that retailed for $25 only cost $6 in Chuck shop. A $50 bottle of cognac that would cost $50 in Tokyo, cost $10 at Chuck shop. Within a year, the trickle of Japanese tourists turned into a stream and then a river." Okay, so now I want to talk about -- there's very specific examples in the book of early problems they had to figure out how to overcome. They don't figure out these problems they're never going to grow into the gigantic profitable business that they become. So there is a lesser-known cognac brand. And I'm going to pronounce it, Camus. That's the way I'm going to say. I have no idea if this is correct. A multiple generation, I think this is the guy that's going to wind up passing through Hawaii. He's running the company at time and I think he is like the fourth generation. They're not -- they have very little market share. And so he comes through, and he pulls up and he says like, "Why are you guys not selling my cognac, okay?" And this is going to be so important because this relationship is going to wind up to a side business that's going to generate, I think, $600 million to $700 million in profit over 20 years to the 4 owners of DFS, okay? But we got to also remember the reputation that duty-free sellers have with luxury brands, which is really funny because one of the best luxury brands in the world is going to buy it about, what, maybe 20 years from now.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it's very interesting. So it says, "When Michel Camus turned up in Hawaii in 1965, Duty Free Shoppers was having trouble getting credit for most suppliers." Okay, this is a huge problem they had overcome. They need -- "I want you to front your product to me. I will sell it, but I don't have the money to buy it from you. Send it to me, when I sell it, I'll give you money, right?" Now -- so that's one problem to overcome. Obviously, the second problem is -- there's going to be a number of problems here. But in this example, the second problem is they just got a really c***** reputation. I think these guys are like drug dealers, scam artists that kind of thing. "If you were becoming a success, they would give you credit. But if you were just starting out, they wouldn't, said Feeney." So he's talking about that -- he's got chicken and egg problem there, right? "The duty-free business was seen by most luxury good manufacturers as a rather shady operation run by hustlers in small, cramped shops. The elite sellers felt their brands would be diminished by association with a discount store." And this is the punch line. "People didn't understand it, and therefore, if they didn't understand it, there must be something wrong with it." Okay, so let's go back to Michel Camus is in this store. It's like, "Hey, why aren't you carrying my cognac." So Chuck is having a conversation with him. He's like, "I need credit, man." And so Chuck convinces Michel, right, "Give me beneficial terms, give me a 120-day credit and sell it to me at $2 a bottle. Chuck sells it in the store for $10 a bottle, okay?" So he's saying, hey, give me 120 days to pay you back and give it to me at $2 a bottle. I'm going to read this section to you, and then I'm going to talk about how it's the same freaking idea that Claude Hopkins used when he was advertising Goodyear tires. He said, now it says Chuck. "He said he needed to buy directly from the cognac maker and he needed generous credit. In return" -- okay, so he's not just asking, hey, give me $120 or 120-day credit, give me good deals on it, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He says, in return -- this is what Claude said start with service. "In return, DFS would promote the cognac and give it a much-needed distribution network in the Pacific and the Far East where the Japanese were beginning to travel around and spend in large numbers." At this time, the cognac was sold primarily in America in small numbers, primarily in Europe in small numbers. Chuck is saying, "Hey, we're building this -- we're going to build the gigantic network all throughout Asia." That's where most of his bread and butter, where he makes his money, right? He says, "You have no presence there. You don't really exist in the mind of Asian consumers. I will fix that." Camus winds up taking up on this offer and over the next few years, I think they've become the #1 cognac brand, either #1 or #2, somewhere towards the top cognac brand in Asia. So they were really smart. The reason I say this compares to what Claude Hopkins did with Goodyear because he's like, "Okay, no one was advertising tires at the time. He's doing the advertising for Goodyear Corporation." Good -- dealers at the time would say, "Hey, they would just order tires from Goodyear as their customers needed it" and Claude Hopkins wanted to find a way to incentivize the dealers to buy more stock, to keep stock. And he says, "Listen, if you'll spend $250 on tire stock before you need it, we're going to do this giant advertising campaign, and we will list all the people, all the different dealers that wind up purchasing at least $250 worth of tire stock from us." And he winds up signing up like, I don't know, 30,000 customers in a few months. Why? Because it was -- he started with service. He's like, "Listen, I need you to do something for me," but I didn't just say, "Hey, buy $250 worth of tire from me before you need it." Who's going to respond to that pitch? Nobody. But if you say, hey, if you do this, I'm running -- or excuse me, if you say, "I'm running an advertising campaign, to get included all you have to do is do this," that completely changes it, and that's a lot more compelling to people. Chuck would not have said like, "Oh, okay, hey, thanks for coming to my store. I don't -- I'll sell it, but you got to give it to me at $2 a bottle and let me pay you 120 days from now." He might take it up on the order. But if you say, "Hey, I'm going to build out this giant network, your brand is not really selling in Asia.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

There is -- we're seeing all -- we have all this information showing that tourism is a -- the Asian tourism is rising, that they're having more disposable income, you could -- your brand could benefit from that. So let's find a way to work out this mutually beneficial agreement." Like that's just a lot better. Now the reason I said this is really important, okay? So there's a series of -- you're seeing how Chuck thinks, right? There's a series of these problems. Maybe they're a large problems, maybe they’re small problems, but they are problems, nonetheless. And if he doesn't overcome them, he's not going to grow and to be as profitable as he is in the future. Here's another problem. So not only does he need credit from liquor manufacturers, right, but banks aren't lending money because why? Duty-free is seen as like you're a hustler, you’re a few steps above a drug dealer. So they have -- there's another problem to overcome. We need banks to give us credit. We don't just need manufacturers to give us credit, we need banks to give us credit. They come up with a crazy work around here. And this comes as a direct result of the relationship that he's building with the head, Michel Camus of the Camus cognac. So he says, "Okay, let's do this." They're going to use their direct -- now that Chuck has established a direct relationship between DFS and the cognac company, they're going to use it as a way to get banks to extend them the badly needed credit, they need to grow their business, but they don't get credit for their stores. Banks are not willing to do that, right? They get credit for setting up a company. It's going to be set up, I think, in the Bahamas. They get a credit for setting up a company that resells cognac to other duty-free companies, is a very creative way to get money. And this is what I just referenced earlier, this separate company is going to wind up making the partners, the 4 partners of DFS $600 million to $700 million. I think it's over 20 or 25 years, something like that. And the same amount of money is like a side business, right? DFS would set up an agency in the Bahamas to become exclusive worldwide distributors for cognac. So they take that contract and they go to finding a series of different investors and banks.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"The agencies would purchase large stocks from Michel Camus, which would be sold now to this separate company, I forgot what it's called. And then they, in turn, that company would sell to DFS and other duty-free companies in Asia, which would create tax-free cash profits for the DFS owners in the Bahamas." And so this is another example of everybody benefiting from this example -- or from this arrangement rather. "Camus would get his distribution network. Feeney would get cash and money flowing through Nassau would guarantee Allan Butler security for bridging loan." So all the 3 parties, the financier, the manufacturer, and Feeney and his partners are all benefiting. It's a very unique way. And then once they start getting a little bit of credit, the -- it's not like they have to -- they don't -- I mean this is a problem they had overcome, but the profit margins on these -- on what they're selling are so large that they don't really tap into especially as it gets going. Now the profits are very small, and I'm going to read that to you now, so they do need some credit. But eventually, they're going to be able to finance almost everything just from the sales of the business. So they avoid bankruptcy. They make a small profit. "The first dividend was $31,250; it was divided among the 4 owners in 1967. So Chuck and Feeney get $12,000, they have a third partner, Alan Parker, he gets $6,000 and Tony gets $780." Now that’s the first dividend, that's in 1967. By 1980s, they're turning over billions. How crazy is this. Tony, I think at the time what -- I think he's got like a 2% stake, something like that. Tony is going to -- he just made $780 in his first dividend from the company, right? He is going to hit the Forbes 400 with even his tiny, tiny percentage. So this gives you an idea of how much this is going to grow. Another creative solution they have. So they rely on tour guides. They give concierges in hotels, tour guides, they're all getting kickbacks, right? This is very common.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This is happening in Hong Kong, but it also happens everywhere. So they incentivize the tour guides to bring them to the shop because the tour guides gets kickback, right? But Chuck's company wants them to go -- to come to the store more than once and the tour guides refuse. So this is DFS solution. They went to the agents again. They went to the agents to get them to bring the Japanese shoppers back a second time. "A lot of the agents resisted. They wouldn't give me this b**_*_**. They've already been back to your store. So what excuse have I got to bring them back to the same store." So that's the -- I wasn't clear. That's what they're hearing from the tour guides like, "No, I'm not doing this," like why -- I already sent them there. Why would I go back again? They said, "Okay, we'll build another one, so that you visit this one and then you go to that one, which is what DFS did. The company opened a second downtown store. They call it the repeater store." The way the company -- once it gets up and running doesn't need a lot of money. So all the profits could go to the owners, it's a little bit about that. "Duty-free shops begin to make substantial profits. The owner agreed to take 90% of the dividends in cash every year. This is a practice that would continue for a quarter of a century. 'We didn't want cash to build up on the company,' said Feeney. So from the time that DFS worked, we did nothing but distribute the money on dividends." So they're living in Hong Kong -- now they moved to Hong Kong and they're balling. They're making a lot of money and this was very interesting because this is going to change. "Feeney's began sharing a life with wealthy and extravagant people. They bought a Jaguar and a small boat. They employed a driver and several other domestic workers. They joined clubs and gave parties. Feeney in those days had 2 tuxedos. They patronized one of the most exclusive and prestigious clubs in the colony. His wife found it easy to live in luxury in Hong Kong. She had domestic help, construction and food was cheap. She brought jewelry and antiques and made the apartment a showcase of décor and beautiful objects." So it's important to note, every -- all the other shareholders are not -- like eventually, Feeney realizes, I don't like this lifestyle. I don't like having money. He felt, I don't – his daughter says he was self-flagellating is the way she would describe him later in life like he just felt guilty about it.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so that's going to -- eventually, it's going to cause a rift between all his partners. They're still worth billions this day. His wife eventually -- she's -- they're going to wind up being divorced. I'll tell you more about that in a little bit. But it says, "As time went by, Feeney started to rethink his attitude about that kind of life. He was so far removed from the life he had lived, the life that his family and friends continue to live in Elizabeth, New Jersey. And the values of thrift that were imbued in him from his childhood. It only became clear to Danielle afterward how strongly her American husband felt that he did not belong to the world of black-tie dinners and leisure yachts and how much he was coming to hate ostentation and despise the life of wealthy socialites." And so this is where we start to see this development of philosophy he continues to this day. I think he's 52, 53, when he gives all his money away. He's 89 now. He gives -- and I like how we set up this foundation where it's not like -- it's not – it doesn't happen in perpetuity. They tried -- they spent all -- I think it closed in 2016. They spent all of it. It's like I'm not -- we're not keeping this on. We're going to do the -- he was a big proponent of giving while living, and he did not like the idea of these foundations that like calcify over time, and they stop acting entrepreneurial in they're giving. And there's a lot of grifts he said. You have people -- there's examples in the book of people supposed to be working for charities, making a couple of million dollars a year, taking limos to lunch, and just -- you can clearly see that -- what they profess to the outside world does not match up with their actions, just to put it that way. All right, so it says, "He was even beginning to have doubts about his right to have so much money. When asked if he was rich at this point in his life, he replied, 'How much is rich beyond all expectations, beyond all deserving? I just reached the conclusion with myself that money, buying boats, and all the trimmings didn't appeal to me.' He was consciously cultivating a frugal lifestyle, wearing a cheap watch and buying a secondhand car. He insisted that he and his family fly economy class.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He reluctantly attended a few black-tie dinners in Paris, but when a picture of him and Danielle appeared in the media, he was furious. He stopped attending such events and broke off all connection with the wealthy social group that couple had started to become part of." And so this is where I mean, he's just very -- he's unlike anybody else that I've studied so far. He's a paradox because it's like okay, he clearly doesn't like having money, but he likes making money. So it says, "Paradoxically, while Feeney became more frugal, he was pushing himself ever harder to build up the business that was making himself even richer. He seemed more driven, more involved in his professional interest. He read business books and biographies of successful businessman. He was constantly traveling. Associates remember Feeney in those days as a driven man, constantly searching for new opportunities, constantly traveling and constantly studying." This is more about how Chuck worked at this time. He was very focused and serious about business. "He brings a focus on business that I hadn't experienced before. If something doesn't work, he has 4 or so different thoughts. He has a multifaceted way of looking at business. He is detail oriented in his approach. He would visit the main store. He would talk to the salespeople and check on display and pricing. The following morning, he would have a list of things to discuss. A lot of managers like to talk down and don't really listen. Chuck listens to the salespeople." So he's constantly looking for new information not only in books, but talking to people, he just sucks up -- what's that -- they call him a suction pump, a suction cup -- suction pump, I think, is what it was. I think it was Henry Kaiser on the book Freedom's Forge, I would say Chuck is very much the same way. This is more about what motivate him. "He was intensely competitive, but his motivation was derived from the creative challenge of applying a better approach to something that had already existed. His definition of success was not having all the money one desired but being able to raise a happy, healthy family. There has to be a balance on life, he said. A balance of business, family and the opportunity to learn and teach." So this is when -- his net worth is about like $250 million, something like that at that time he seriously considered giving it all away.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He winds up -- the closest person to him and they wind up having -- falling out later, is this guy named Harvey Dale. He's an attorney and he's really influenced Chuck's view on philanthropy. And he does it by using examples like John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, so he sends a quote that Frederic Gates gave to John D. Rockefeller. He says. "Mr. Rockefeller, your fortune is rolling up like an avalanche. You must distribute it faster than it grows. If you do not, it will crush you and your children and your children's children." They discussed the writings of Andrew Carnegie. I would say Carnegie is the most influential person like historical person on Feeney’s thinking on this. If you haven't listened, I've done 2 podcasts on him, #73, #74. So it says, Carnegie accumulated a massive fortune and gave away much of it during his lifetime to fund the establishments of library, schools and universities. Feeney re-read several times Carnegie's famous essay. They're calling it wealth. I always had it referred to as the gospel of wealth. I'm pretty sure it's the same thing. I've read it, too. The Carnegie argue that there are 3 ways to dispose of surplus wealth. It could be left to the family, given to the government or given away while alive. The first is motivated by vanity and misguided affection for the children. He felt that you would burden them and it could be a curse to give too much money to your kids. The second required the owner to die before the wealth was used, and then his wishes could be thwarted. He's dead. He can't do anything about it, right? The third ensured that the surplus wealth was put to good use and not dispersed over hundreds of years in trifling amounts. The best way to use wealth concluded Carnegie was to provide the ladders upon which the aspiring can rise such as universities and libraries. So a lot of his giving, he likes to build brick-and-mortar like education systems, he’ll pay for people's colleges, Feeney that is. But this idea of, if you're aspiring, there's a lot of poor, smart, determined people that don't have access. So if I can use my wealth to give them access that's a good and he does this all over the world. This is in Vietnam, Ireland, America, Australia, everywhere.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I think his foundation by the time they're done, they gave away $7 billion, something like that, it's a lot of money. Carnegie also cautioned that a man of wealth should set an example of modest unostentatious living, shunning displays of extravagance. What Carnegie advocated was to have a profound effect on Feeney. I do remember somebody gave me a copy of his speech that Carnegie had given at Cornell and for some reason, I researched that speech and read 2 books on Carnegie. And so Carnegie continues to -- once he becomes influenced by -- excuse me, Feeney, once he becomes influenced by Carnegie, he passes that on, right? I always think about that great quote from Bob Noyce, knowledge is power, knowledge shared is power multiplied, and we see that in Feeney. Now the reason I'm reading this section to you, though, is because I think Feeney has a problem is very common with people is like you find you can't express like there's a thought that you have in your mind, but you can't find the words to express it as eloquently as other people have. So you see this like music, sometimes is able to express how you feel better, writing can sometimes describe your feeling or point of view better than you can. And so Feeney was definitely one of those people. It says, "Feeney gave all the people involved in his foundation, a copy of Carnegie's essay on wealth to read. Although brilliant when talking about business, Feeney was never good at articulating his philosophy on life. It embarrassed him. Instead of explaining what was going on in his mind, he'd give friends and family members articles for magazines and newspapers. They had to infer the message. Giving out copies of Carnegie's essay was a clever way of enlightening them on the essence of his giving. He also kept a copy of the essay on his desk" and this is an important point, like people can influence you, but you don't have to copy everything to do. They're not -- we want their ideas. We're not idolizing these people.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It says, "Carnegie was not a precise role model for Chuck Feeney. Carnegie made his fortune through harsh and ruthless business methods and he loved having his name on libraries and schools, neither of which applied to Feeney, but his basic message was clear. Give while alive." And so he's going to give away his fortune. He puts in his foundation. He doesn't tell anybody. It winds up becoming public because there is a lawsuit between the partners because Chuck wants to sell to LVMH and some of them don't. And it's just -- this is a tale as old as time. It's clearly something to know that the partners grew apart as they made more money. "The more successful they were, the weaker the bonds of friendship became. Things had changed since the 1970s when the company was still a young, energetic entrepreneurial and fun. And we could argue and debate each other during the day and then go out to dinner that night with our families and never mention work." So he's going to give everything away. He's going to hold back because I don't think his wife was on board and we see this later on because she gets more money in the divorce. So Chuck Feeney reached an agreement with Danielle that when they came back to sign everything away, $40 million and the houses would be held back for her and the children and the money paid out over a few years. It was a figure thought necessary to take care of the houses, the kids, the education, clothes, boats, artwork, and jewelry. And who wants the clothes, boats and jewelry? Well, as we see later on, his wife liked that lifestyle. It's just -- and that causes a rift and they're going to get divorced a few years after this. So he did agree, okay, I'm not going to give away -- to put away almost all of the assets, but -- and this money and houses are in her name, not his, which is really interesting. She regrets this later on and then when they get divorced, she winds up suing for more money. This is more about Chuck's desire for privacy. We see the same -- like he definitely moved in secret during his business years and in giving. Eventually, the lawsuit comes out, and then he realizes he can't keep staying anonymous if he wants to influence other billionaires to give while they are alive. But this is more about his desire for privacy.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

From the start, Chuck Feeney was adamant that he did not want recognition for his giving. There would be no plaques or names on the buildings he funded. No thank you dinners, no honorary degrees. People should not know that he was behind the foundation. Beneficiaries should not even be told his name. While this stem from an absence of a demanding ego being secretive had become almost second nature of Feeney. Practically everything he undertook in his life depending on keeping confidences and maintaining a low profile. Feeney insisted at meetings, "Don't go out and blow your horns about how big and successful we are. The less you speak and the less ostentatious you are, there will be fewer people who will be angry and jealous." So that is something that Ben Franklin said almost 300 years ago. In his biography he talks about that, you're going to be a lot more successful if you can avoid making other people envy or jealous of you. And so we see Feeney echoing the same idea that Franklin had a couple of centuries before. At this time, the 4 owners are getting dividends, but there's a different CEO running the company. And this guy, he does very, very common. As successful CEO, he wants attention. And he gives an interview, and the owners are very not happy -- the owners are not happy. "The great department stores are a century old, but we were born with the jet" enthused Bellamy. That's his name, in an interview published in the Financial Times, explaining how the company had created an unequal sales machine to cash in on Japanese consumer culture. He explained how DFS had employed shrewd marketing to get Japanese patronage. Why are you telling people our playbook. We're a private company, shut up. When the DFS owners saw the article, their reaction was explosive. Feeney was agitated. The partners knew that one of the reasons for DFS' success was that its international operations were a mystery to outsiders. No one quite knew how duty-free worked or how big DFS was. And they're really going to know when these bids become public. It says above all, the DFS owners wanted to keep secret the amount they were taking out of the company in dividends.

This is bananas. In 1986, it was a staggering $186 million -- 1 year, $186 million in cash, in profit. Feeney received $39 million of the $186 million. The size of the duty-free opportunity, it's just hard to comprehend when you're reading this book. Here's an example, this is just one store. "Sales at the Waikiki store had soared to $400 million a year. They were making $20,000 a square foot in revenue, and their bid shows just how valuable the store was." This is what I referenced earlier. They were offering to pay the state of Hawaii $2 million every 3 days for the next 5 years just for the right to run a couple of stores. That's insane. $2 million every 3 days for 5 years. So they wanted to -- the bid they put in -- they overbid by a long shot, but there was a silver lining. And again, this is not like -- there's no coming in second place. If you lose these bids, your company is gone. You have to win the bid. So there's a lot of risk here. "The DFS owners sat there, aghast. They had overbid by $779 million. We left a s_*_ load of money on the table, $0.75 billion, they said, what happened? I wish I knew. We were rather foolish. Maybe we were all making too much money. There was one upside apart from winning the concession though. Never again was anybody going to come in and bid against us. 5 years later, there was no counterbid." Yes, you're overbidding by $0.75 billion. I don't know how much competition you have." Looking back years later Feeney defended the bid. The worst thing to do was loose. The truth was that we could pay this amount, and we could still make huge profits. So not only at this point, all the profits that he's getting is going into his foundation, but he's also investing it rather well. And he's got a couple of other side businesses. This guy just couldn't help himself and make a lot of money. The following year, in 1988, even in the wake of the huge bid in Hawaii, the cash dividend paid to the owners from the profits of the duty-free stores was $400 million.

This is a private company owned by just 4 people, $400 million. Of this, Chuck received $155 million. So really it says Chuck received, but his foundation, that money goes to his foundation, okay? On top of the profits from its own business portfolio and multimillion dollar dividends from the Camus agency, that other business I told you about, check this out. "The foundation was raking in more than $2 million every 5 days in cash." That's just Chuck. That's not his other 3 partners. "The foundation was raking in more than $2 million every 5 days in cash." In the last decade before 1988, they're going to sell the company in the '90s. Before 1988, annual sales had increased from $278 million to $1.5 billion. It was an astonishing growth rate of almost 20% per year. What only the 4 owners knew was that during that period, they had received cash dividends of $867 million. So that's from '78 to '88, right? They received almost $900 million in cash and Chuck took $330 million of that. Now here's the crazy part. And there's -- again, I just think this speaks to human nature, something we should know, even while making hundreds of millions of dollars, the 4 partners find a way to fight over little things. So it says, "We wanted to protect the integrity of the company and not have a shareholder's dispute that would tear DFS to shreds. It was too valuable of an asset to play games with." So they sign a contract together where if they have a disagreement, they're going to bring in what they call the wise man, that's an arbitrator. And they bring in this arbitrator and he's just like, "What the hell is wrong with you guys." He says, now he sat the 4 partners down and told them, "You jerks, you've got the greatest thing going. Come on. You've got to get it together and find a method of resolving disputes." And so they're not going to accomplish this. There's going to be a huge fight over whether to sell the company or not. And right before this happens, Chuck is going to wind up. He's got like 5 kids. I think they've been married for 25, 30 years, and this is crazy and sad. In October 1990, Chuck and Danielle had separated over his close relationship with his long-time German assistant, Helga. I think he remarries the secretary essentially, who often travel with them. They've been leading increasingly separate and different lives.

Danielle had known for some time from her husband's depressed and angry moods at home that her relationship with him was over. And again, he's depressed and angry at a time when he's making hundreds -- like what does that tell you about us. We're very complex beings apparently. Feeney had been spending less and less time at the family's houses. And he made a point of never going onboard the yacht that Danielle had brought – had purchased nor did he set foot in the elegant mansion, which served as a family home on the French Riviera. The children were immensely saddened by the split, they were close to both parents. The conscious between the mother and father was never less obvious to them. He became a frugal, self-flagellating philanthropist who craves anonymity, whereas Danielle had a big yacht and a big personality. Feeney told his children, now all young adults, that he would be changing his life that he would be constantly on the road, living only a few weeks at most in any one place at any one time. He gave each a binder with articles explaining what motivated his giving. One was Carnegie's essay on wealth. Another was about the excesses of the Sultan of Brunei, who spent $1 million on a children's birthday. This was a singular way of telling them about himself and his motivations. So now Danielle is like, okay, I don't like the agreement that we had 6 years earlier. And so they sue and it says the new settlement was reached, that gave Danielle an additional $60 million that comes from the foundation and then another $40 million that was pledged over 5 years to a family charitable foundation. Feeney insisted that Danielle get all the family homes in Paris, London, the South of France, Connecticut, Hawaii, New York. He wanted them to stay in the family to avoid any bitterness, he said. He took nothing for himself. Okay, so at this time, Chuck is the one that leads the deal with Bernard Arnault, the guy that runs LVMH. And they agreed a purchase price, it's right around $4 billion, somewhere in there, $3.5 billion, $4 billion. That purchase price, I think he gets like $1.6 billion. Two partners, him, another partner agreed to sell, the other partner do not. And so again, they have a fight. This is the last time they ever meet together, which is just insane considering they built one of the most profitable business -- private businesses.

It says, "The wise man, the arbitrator expressed his frustration with the impasse. Two people want to sell, two do not. This has happened before in the history of the world, and people have worked it out. It doesn't require a rocket scientist, only a recognition of reality." And he's like, don't -- "Why you guys end up suing up each other." He says, "A protracted legal wrangle could expose DFS's dirty linen, he warned. And if he were forced to arbitrate, the inner workings of the most secretive companies in the world -- one of the most secretive companies in the world would be revealed. His words had no effect." So it says, at this time, Miller, which is the main – Feeney and Miller, their relationship disintegrated a long time before this. But as you recall, these are the 2 that started the company. Feeney recalled that Miller went storming out. It was the last occasion that the 4 guys who had presided for 3 decades over one of the most successful retail operations in the 20th century would meet together in one room. Miller is the only one that doesn't sell out. He's on the side with Tony. Tony fought the deal the whole way. On the very last day, he's like, "All right, yes." And then later on, he says, "Chuck was right all along." So this is what he says, "He conceded that he had been wrong to oppose the sale all along. Chuck was a genius on timing. He had a great sense of the unknown, a feel that something wasn't right somewhere and he was right" because this company winds up going losing -- going down by quite a bit. It happened more than once in our company that he came in, meaning Feeney said, "Let's do something. And we took a different track and he was right." "Arnault had good -- had, in fact, acquired a declining asset. In the 18 months, DFS' sales dropped from $3 billion to $1.5 billion with Japan's recession, an Asian economic downturn and the weakening of European currencies, the core DFS customers are spending less. Dividends dried up. A year after the sale, 320 people -- 320 members of the staff were laid off, and Hong Kong had its first-ever loss."

And this is Bob Miller on his relationship about what he calls b _and lawyers -- I just think there's a lot of like wisdom in his experience. And hopefully, if we ever get in a situation like this, whether the numbers are just big or not to try to avoid it because he has like all the stuff we did the legal stuff, was just -- it was stupid. It was useless. We should just figure it out ourselves. So again, he didn't know that. Maybe it's obvious the wise man telling, "Hey, what are you guys doing, you are s_ this up, just talk it out and figure it out." And maybe I have to go through this experience to learn things right. "We were distant at that time in any case. I really hadn't seen Chuck since 1996. All partnerships break up at some stage, even the Beatles. Arguments about who contributed most of the success of the partnerships and then the wives get involved, and it gets extremely complicated. We've got -- we had more money than we knew what to do with. So everybody was happy. Forget it. It's just not worth worrying about. LVMH bought out Chuck and Alan at a very good price. God bless them if they're happy with their money. Do I regret not selling out at the same time? I don't know. I have thought a lot about it. I don't know if all that money in a lump sum would have made me any happier than I am now. I really love DFS and the company. But all the legal things we did with the wise man, to be quite frank, it was all pure b**_*_**. We didn't really need all that fancy legal stuff. The lawyers have a way of dragging you in and making things more complicated than they are. We were paying huge legal bills at the time. And I don't think any of us -- or I don't think any of that would have affected the outcome. When the dust settles, you find out it was all just a huge waste of time, energy, and money."

And I think this is a good way to close on just a quick summary on the history of the company. "The success of DFS arose from the fact that we're in the right place at the right time. Nobody ever put a penny in the business. We took out $8 billion. Nobody is that smart. You've just got to have a lot of things going your way." And that is where I'll leave it. If you want the full story, I'll leave a link in the show notes, if you buy the book using that link, you'll be supporting the podcast at the same time. The book is, I would say, 60% -- I don't 70% of the book is really not about the business. It's about what happens after all the work he does with philanthropy. There's obviously a lot more parts I skipped over about his early life and everything else. I do think it was a really unique perspective, a really unique story. I can see why the book is so highly recommended. But if you want to read the full story, there's a link on the show notes for you. Also, a lot of new listeners are discovering the podcast from existing subscribers, buying gift subscriptions for friends, for co-workers. So if you want to do that, I'll leave a handy link down there as well. It feels good to do something nice for somebody and it helps the podcast at the same time. That is 171 books down 1,000 to go and I'll talk to you again soon.

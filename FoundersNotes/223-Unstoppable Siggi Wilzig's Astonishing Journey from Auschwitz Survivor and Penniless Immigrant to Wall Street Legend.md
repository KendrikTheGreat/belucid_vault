“When people ask me, how did you survive? I leave out a small thing, which isn't really a small thing. Any survivor who has a heart and brains lives with guilt, that they survived, and others didn't. My mother was sent straight to the gas chamber. My father was beaten to death. My sister, Martha, was murdered. My brothers, Willy and Martin and Louis, were murdered.” “And here I am, and they're all dead. Why them and not me. It was as if God had his hand on my shoulder to lead and guide me when I was all alone and in mortal danger. I remember everything since I was 3.5 years old. I can tell you the color of the stripes on my mother's sweater from when I was a little boy. It's good and bad, such a memory because everything stays with you and you can't shut it off.” “I remember where we went fishing as boys, but I also remember what the barracks look like in Auschwitz and the Kapo with a stick in his hand and everything he did and that memory is very, very bad. It never goes away. He reached down and rolled up the leg of his pants. Look, see, since the day of my liberation, I wear 2 pairs of socks. For the past 50 years, I've never left the house without 2 pairs of socks, that and a safety pin, 2 pairs of socks because in the camps, a pair of socks can make the difference between living and dying.” “The deficiency of the body, the dirt, the filth from a splinter, you would develop rotting flesh. One splinter from a wooden shoe and you would die. And why a safety pin? A little pin could save your life in the camps. If you need to hold up a piece of cloth as a bandage around your leg or keep your pants up. How did I remain alive for almost 2 years in Auschwitz? It wasn't by education. I didn't have any. It was the hand of the Almighty. I'm going to tell you something that I don't think I've ever said. As terrible as it sounds, I don't think I could live without the nightmares.” “It gives me a very ultrarealistic difference between life and death. It shows me what life is now, and I would never give that up, never, never, never.”

That was an excerpt from the book that I want to talk to you about today, which is Unstoppable: Siggi Wilzig's Astonishing Journey from Auschwitz Survivor and Penniless Immigrant to Wall Street Legend and it's written by Joshua M. Greene. This story is unbelievable. We do learn what Siggi had to go through and endure and then what he's able to accomplish after the fact. I'm going to jump right into the book. The book starts when he's 21 years old. The year is 1947. He's arriving for the first time in America, and he's about to be reunited with one of his sisters. As they're pulling into a port in New York City, it says “21-year-old Siggi had been nauseous, vomiting and losing weight for most of the 2-week ocean journey. Hearing the cheers, he climbed weakly to the top deck and took a deep breath. The fresh air was a relief after the bad smells of so many people crammed together on the deck below. Nearly all Jews deported to Auschwitz died within 4 months of arrival, but here he was alive and in America after having spent nearly 2 years in that concentration camp.” So he's about to meet his sister, Jenny, who escaped about a decade before the time that Siggi arrives in America. And so I want to tell you a little bit about how -- why Siggi was -- actually helped save her life as just a young kid. So the family was being persecuted in the small town in Germany. They have to flee that town. They wind up in Berlin in 1936. You could not have had worse timing. And so as a little boy, he's realizing, hey, there's a lot of people fleeing. And he says, by listening in on the conversations in cafes he learned that some people were managing to escape Europe by securing exit visas. Siggi visited a dozen counsels looking for back entrances and open windows in his mission to steal the necessary documents. And so this has taken place 11 years before he's going to meet the sister that he's about to steal these documents so she can escape in New York. So it says “Siggi risked his life scaling embassy walls breaking into offices and gathering up rubber stamps.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“With the stolen tools, he forged 3 visas. And so at first, he offers these visas to his parent -- two of these visas to his parents. His mother says, “No, I'm not going anywhere. I was born here and I will die here.” She didn't know how prophetic that statement was because in, let's see, 7 years from now, they're going to be sent to Auschwitz. She's killed immediately. And then a few weeks later, his father is beaten to death. And so he dies in Auschwitz as well. So he says “She declined. I was born here, and I will die here.” So Siggi gave her Visa to his older brother, Joe, who had already been a prisoner in a concentration camp. So this is well before they get sent to Auschwitz but managed to get release. Siggi figured Joe was already a marked man and needed to get out of Germany quickly. His sister, Jenny, was pregnant, and Siggi insisted that she and her husband accept the 2 remaining visas. So those are the 3 visas they were able to escape. So as Jenny and Joe left Germany, they first traveled to -- they left Germany, were able to immigrate to Shanghai in China. Then from Shanghai, they made their way to the Dominican Republic and then from Dominican Republic, they were able to get into America. And so it was very common during this time, they hadn't had any way of speaking. Siggi had no idea like what was going on in Jenny's life. They wind up meeting on the docks in New York City. So the book starts with him as a 21-year-old landing in America, flat broke, he's got like $200 in his pocket. And then from there, he builds this -- what's going to wind up being a multiple hundred-million-dollar business empire. But it's -- that's the first chapter. That's where the first chapter ends. And then it goes back in time, and he talks about his time at Auschwitz and everything he has to go through to get back to this point. So he's wound up meeting Jenny -- before I get to Auschwitz, though, I want to fill you in because this was -- just gives you an understanding of just how insane and brutal the experiences that this guy had to go through. So he's meeting -- remember when he gave her the Visa, she's pregnant, they escape. He hasn't a seen her since then. So it says Jenny told Siggi, the tragic news that her 5-year-old daughter, the one she was pregnant with had died of smallpox in Shanghai before the journey to Dominican Republic.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Siggi remembered watching hundreds of children die, forced into gas chambers. Their dead bodies later thrown into the crematorium fires and made a mental inventory of his family. He was alive, Jenny and her husband were alive, their brothers Joe and Irwin had survived. Everyone else was gone. He would calculate that 59 members of his family had perished. So through there's this Jewish refugee charity organization in America at the time, providing all these refugees like a tiny little apartment. And so it says the arrivals were escorted into the room, Siggi being one of these people for many. It was the first time in years that they held a key to their own quarters. “What now,” he wondered. He had nothing, no resources and no credentials. He spoke with a thick German accent, had only a grade school education and years of torture and starvation were still fresh in his mind. Yet, here he was, still breathing, staring out the window at the snow-covered New York Streets, the $200 in his pocket would soon disappear if he didn't find work. It was clear, and so this is what Siggi is realizing, it was clear that Americans were alive in every sense of the word -- world -- word rather, excuse me, moving purposefully towards some vision of tomorrow. He liked that. he would do that too, grasp opportunities and not allow the darkness of the past to rob him of a bright future. His job was to grab whatever scraps remain from the rubble of his life and cobble them back together into an edifice of a yet-to-be-determined size and shape. Okay. So now we go back in time. We go to early 1930s, Germany, what it was like to be Jewish at this point. We're going to see that even from the age of 14, he was working over 70 hours a week in forced labor. This is before he's sent to Auschwitz. And it says, by 1936, Jewish children are no longer allowed to attend school. And Siggi's schooling came to an abrupt end. Jewish businesses were taken over and Jewish men were sent to work in forced labor factories. So by the time he's 16, he's already been working in some of these factories for quite a while.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It says in 1943, 16-year-old Siggi was in the middle of his night shift at a lamp factory when an officer walked in and arrested him. For the past 2 years, he's been working 12-hour shifts, 6 days a week. And so this scene that's happening now where he's being arrested, his entire family and everybody lives in their building and their neighborhood are pulled out. A few weeks ago, I read the biography of Steven Spielberg and Spielberg's foundation, he started a foundation to document when he was doing a movie Schindler's List. He was -- started a foundation to document all of like the holocaust survivors, memories. And so Spielberg is actually in this book at the end because that foundation, interviews and documents everything that's Siggi -- right before Siggi dies because Siggi die -- gets diagnosed with Stage IV blood cancer. And so before he dies, he went on spending 10 or 20 hours just interviewing with Steven Spielberg's foundation and just reliving all of the memories and everything he had. But the reason I bring that up to is because when I read his biography, Spielberg's biography a few weeks ago, I also rewatch Schindler's List and there's a scene in that movie, which is almost exactly what this scene -- where I’m at in the book is. So it says they pull everybody out of the building, saying, hey, grab your stuff, they're not telling them where you're going, bring all your supplies. And so you see that when they get to Auschwitz. In the movie, they have like all the boots go in a big pile, all of the suitcases go in a big pile, like the Nazis are taking all the jewelry and robbing them. And so it says, in one of the crowds are waiting deportation, Siggi saw his father and his mother standing with his older brother, his older sister, her husband and their 7-year-old son, Siggi's other brothers were also there. These are the ones that get murdered. Everyone held suit cases and bags of food. In the distance, he saw a girl, a little girl around his age, a little younger and her brother. And instantly saw a girl in the dark – in a dark green overcoat looking alone and lost. He hurried over to the girl in the dark green coat. She came from a poor family like his, and all she wanted was to hold his hand.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“I don't care what happens to me now,” the girl whispered to him. She -- and this is what he's saying. This is what Siggi says about that. She didn't know where her family was. She had no one, and she knew I wouldn't leave her. So in Schindler's List there's a girl in the red coat, that's famous because it's all black and white, and then you see her walk as the scenes occurring, and she's in a red coat, in Siggi's scene she's in a green coat. So there's – they’re ushered on to trains real quick, and he says, unless you were there, you can't imagine how horrifying a nightmare it was. So the train stops, they get out, Siggi overheard other prisoners say the name of this place, Auschwitz. So everybody is separated, he doesn't know where his mom and dad are. He does not know where his siblings are, so a guard comes up to him -- a guard came up to him. How old are you, he snapped, 18, Siggi lied, what profession, master toolmaker, he lied again. The guard pushed Siggi onto a line of prisoners on the left, then pushed the girl on the green coat to a line on the right. Siggi did not know that the line on the right was for prisoners selected to be killed, that almost all children under 18 who were sent to the right along with the younger children, the elderly and the sick. Nor did he know that anyone without useful skills was also sent to the right to be killed. Where -- and this is so -- there's going to be a couple of paragraphs like this one in the book, where he's talked -- like I just said the opening like the survivor's guilt, like 59 members of my family perished, why was I not one of them. And so he says, where did the impulse come from the lie. Claiming he was 18 and a master toolmaker. True, he did have some toolmaking training in trade school, but he never completed his schooling and never worked a day in his life as a toolmaker. The mystery of that impulse, which surely saved him from the gas chamber would plague him for the rest of his life. And then there's just so many paragraphs like this one. I mean it's just like very similar to -- again, the parallel because it's fresh on my mind, just rewatching it is – of Schindler's List.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so this is very interesting because right after it talks about undoubtedly poor treatment of people around him. It talks about his complicated relationship with his religion and with God. And the fact that from -- there's no getting over what he went through, and so it tormented him until the day he died. And so he winds up having like a -- almost like he uses Rabbis like a therapist, okay? So it says, “Rabbi Katz served as Siggi’s therapist and confidant, the one person with whom Siggi could discuss his nightmares and flashback.” So he would wake up in the middle of night, screaming. He’d have nightmares, he'd be drenched in sweat, like just -- I just can't even imagine. I know I'm repeating myself and that's not very descriptive, but it's just -- I just have no words for this. So it says the Rabbi and Siggi would speak for hours about the meaning of life, the role of evil, and whatever business issues were on his mind. Siggi and Rabbi Katz also shared an existential dilemma, namely, how to reconcile a benevolent god with the murder of more than 1 million children in the holocaust. “How come you never go to the synagogue,” Siggi's young son once asked. “I have a mixed relationship with God,” he replied. “I go to synagogue on the Jewish holidays and give thanks to the Almighty. Without the will of the Almighty, there's no way a shorty like me would have survived the holocaust.” “But I don't go to synagogue every week. I have a hard time being thankful for the murder of 1.5 million Jewish children, or the murder of my innocent 7-year-old nephew and 2-year-old niece.” So what he's referencing there is that line when they separated them right when he got to Auschwitz. He's put in the left line. The girl in the green coat and some of those other family members are put in the right. In his right line was his sister, her husband, and their 7-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter, and they were killed that day. They were gassed and killed that day.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It says Siggi again scanned the line to the right and caught a glimpse of the girl in the dark green over coat. As if seeing her for the first time he thought, she looked so young, so innocent, he watched snowfall in the loading platform as guards marched her off with the others. A moment later, she was gone. And then we have this testimony he's giving later in life where he says, “as a Jew growing up in Germany in those years,” Siggi said, “you expected to be beaten and mistreated. But a gas chamber or crematorium, now that you didn't expect, the stench and the smoke from the chimneys and what they did to the children, what they did to the children, I can still hear the screaming of children who were ripped away from their parents.” “The memories don't stop to this day. I argue with the almighty that if cries of children,” he's saying this 50 years after it happened. Wait till I get to some of the memories he has at the end of the book when he's dying in the hospital, it's just -- I don't know if I’ve ever read a book like this. “The memories don't stop to this day. I argue with the almighty that if the cries of children will leave my ears, I would go more often to the synagogue, flame shooting up from the crematorium, the horrible smell, the horrible smell. It was unbelievable.” So in addition to reading this book, I was also watching documentaries on the Third Reich and concentration camps. And I was on the phone on the with a friend right before I sat down to talk to you, and I said I was – that -- the impact of this book had on me. I woke up knowing I was going to record today. And I just have -- I told a friend of mine, I have nothing to complain about. Like I'm healthy. I have a roof over my head. I have air conditioning, heating, cooling, I have an espresso machine that makes espresso anytime I want it, I have a food full of -- or excuse me, refrigerator full of food, I have clothing, like you just read, you expose yourself to these stories and you just -- it helps put things into perspective of how good you have it and how bad and drastic and tragic life can get at certain points of history in certain places on the planet.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It's just -- it's unbelievable. So I want to go into like his mindset there's a line in a song that I love, and I took a screenshot of the lyric page and keep it on my phone. It says, “the point I'm making is the mind is a powerful place and what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way.” And so something that saves Siggi is effective, like he's engaged in psychological warfare and he compares and contrast like his mindset like he’s like, "I can't allow myself to think that I won't survive. I won't give up no matter how bad I want to, I'm going to survive, I'm going to get out of this place." And so part of that is the fact that Siggi, from a young age, he has an extreme amount of self-confidence and this helps them a lot in his business life later on, where he takes over an oil company and had -- knew nothing about oil companies. He takes over a bank, he knew nothing about a bank. He just assumed, "hey, I can learn, I can figure these things out." And so what he realizes is like, "Hey, I'm smarter than these guards." And so the only asset I have. They have guns and they have clubs and they can beat me and they can throw me in a gas chamber like, I've got to use my mind. And so he says, the guards were sadist and they look for any reason to kill. The Nazis opened the prisons of Germany and brought hardened criminals into the camps and made them masters over kids like me. Remember, he's 16 at this time. He says, because I get out with the guards, I always felt superior to them. They were -- how crazy -- like what an extreme mindset you have to have. They've taken everything from you. They've separated you from your family. I don't know at this point -- he doesn't know his mom's dead because his mom gets killed the first day. He's going to find that out after. But they're taking your family, taking all your possessions. They've shaved your head, they take away your clothes, they make you forced labor and you're like, “I'm superior to you.” So it's just “I always felt superior to them, I hated them. I hated their brutality, their inhuman behavior. I felt stronger, more intelligent, and I had confidence in myself from childhood. So even though they had guns and did all the killing, I felt superior.” This is what I mean about the mind is a powerful place and what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“It was obviously a touch of arrogance and some of it was justified and some of it not justified, but even in the totally hopeless condition, I looked down on all of them.” And then there's some just background that the author gives us, between 1.1 million and 1.3 million people were murdered in Auschwitz. So he's constantly going up to the guard saying, "Hey, I have this skill." He lies about his age, he says, "Oh yes, you need somebody to make tools, I can make tools." You need -- anything that they said they needed, he'd say, "Yes, I can -- I know how to do that." So they need help in a hospital. I mean that's like a – and he makes a point, it's not a hospital that you think, like they're barely people -- keeping people alive. So he lies his way into a job at a hospital by saying that he has experience as a nurse. The reason he does that is because it's in the mid of the winter, this job is inside and so it saves him from laboring in the snow and a lot of people freezing to death and dying. And it's because of this, he's going to be reunited temporarily and he's actually going to see his father die. So it says the first day in the hospital, the Kapos made me load Jewish patients onto a truck. I still have a picture in my mind of Jewish patients cursing me for not lying to the guards, for not telling them that this one is healthy and that one is healthy. The prisoner thought that a male nurse like me had power to save them. I had no such power. I just loaded them onto a truck. I knew where they were going, but I couldn't bear the idea that I was sending them to their death. So I told myself the truck was taking them to recover at some other hospital or maybe some other camp. 3 hours later, the truck came back with their clothing. They were all dead. And then this is just -- this is -- I hate to use that word again, but this is just unbelievable, what I'm about to read you. One day, a doctor took Siggi to an area of the infirmary where he saw patients on the verge of death. Siggi looked around and there on one of the lower bunks was his father. He was badly beaten to a point that he wept and he says -- Siggi wept as he recalled the moment -- this moment then continued. “I knew that he wouldn't make it. My father's last words were son, who's going to take care of you.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“Don't worry, I have friends,” Siggi reassured him. The death sergeant came the next day with prisoners carrying a big vat of potatoes. Imagine that you're starving to death, and here you see potatoes like your grandmother used to make, you would give your right arm for it. The guard stood there and ordered me to feed it to the prisoners and we gave these dying people 10 to 15 large spoons of these raw potatoes. Siggi walked around the room, laying out portions to the sick prisoners including his father. One older prisoner shoved the ladle away. That older prisoner said to me, “what are you an idiot?” “I'm not an idiot.” I told him. And he says to me, "Yes, yes, you are. You don't know what that -- what -- you don't know what's what, come back tomorrow, and you'll see. And the next morning, 80% of them were dead with their stomachs bloated. They had been bleeding all night from it. And there was my father, dead, the potatoes were poisoned. Poisoned potatoes. I think I helped kill my father.” Siggi covered his father with a blanket and walked away before prisoners arrived to cart the bodies to the crematorium. I wanted to remember him the way he looked in life, not the way he looked in a pile of corpses. They had been in Auschwitz, fewer than 40 days. And unfortunately, it gets even worse. A few weeks later, word reached Siggi, that his mother had been sent to the gas chamber that day she left. And so this is an example of what I mentioned earlier, he just refused to believe that he was doomed, the older prisoners are just saying, "Hey, give up, it's useless, we're all going to die. Just go and electrocute yourself on the fence,” they told him, “you won't survive, better run now and grab the electric wire.” “I couldn't take such talk about not coming out alive” Siggi said, “I didn't want to hear it. Whenever my mind told me I was not going to survive, the almighty told me to keep going. So I stayed away from others.” In the hospital, Siggi had met a prisoner doctor, whom he described as a bit of a philosopher. Siggi told the doctor -- so he's got a -- he talks about like choices inside Auschwitz pose like a dilemma for prisoners because you didn't know if the information was dependable or not, like, oh, take that job, don't take the other job, stay away from that Kapo, don't go next to this Kapo.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The right – the "right choice" could wind up being fatal. And so he's asking the doctor like, what should I do? The SS are trying to recruit me because they need carpenters, but he didn't know if it was like a trick. And so he says, I told the doctor about the carpenter training in the main camp and asked what he thought. I can't tell you what to do, the doctor said. It could be just as bad over there or worse. And the reason I'm bringing this to your attention is because what the doctor says here, this is -- he takes his advice not only now, but he takes his advice for the rest of his life. You're a smart young fellow, the doctor said, follow your instincts. That was advice Siggi would remember for the rest of his life. So he survives almost 2 years. This is now 1945. There's actually Stalin's forces, the Russian forces are actually coming into where Auschwitz is. And so they're actually having to get all the prisoners and make them do what is -- what will be known after the fact as a death march. And so really the reason I'm going to read this section to you is because this is an illustration that Siggi constantly had to make life-and-death decisions under a great amount of uncertainty. And so him and he's got a small group of friends or this guy Lothar, which is going to move to America, too. He’s going to wind up surviving. He changed his name to Larry. So Larry winds up saving his life, so they wound up being like really good friends for the rest of their life. But it says the night before the death marches from Auschwitz began, and when the other prisoners were asleep, Siggi and Lothar and 4 other men crept out and hid in the mud under the barracks, huddled together in their blankets, watching fires burn in the distance and debated what to do. Rumor had it that the Germans were going to blow up the camp and leave no evidence of their crimes. One man said that "healthy prisoners," those who could still walk would be marched out at dawn. Another man said it was impossible to stay hidden under the barracks. Who knew how long they could survive in the bitter cold. Better, they all agreed to take the chances on the march rather than freeze to death hiding. They crawled back inside the barracks and waited for morning.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so that winds up being the right choice. They were unsure, but the healthy prisoners, the ones that could walk, were forced to march. Now here's the problem. This is January. It's freezing cold. They've been – I was about to say living. They've been, I guess, existing on less than 700 calories a day. So you're going to have -- it says, they go from nearly 6,000 people start the march and 5 days later, they get to this other camp. It's -- I can't pronounce it's like Mauthausen and only 1,600. So 1,600 people survive out of 6,000. Siggi and Larry being one of them. But this is where he winds up being separated from his best friend. Now, remember this part in a few minutes because it's unbelievable what happens to Larry. And so I'll get there in a minute. So it says Siggi, Larry and some other survivors of the death march collapsed on the barracks floor. Larry, Siggi said, in a weak voice. When they ask you what you can do, say -- and he's almost dead. Siggi had to wind up like almost carrying him on this march. And the reason he did this and he was pissed off at the other people that were supposed to help because the Larry had saved a bunch of people's lives. And so people offered him, "Hey, keep going” -- they passed him in the death march, and they told Larry, like, "Hey, keep it up, you can do” -- they offered words of encouragement, but they wouldn't actually help carry him. And Siggi actually wind up help him, carry him he's like, "I have this -- He saved my life. I have this obligation to do the same for him." So it says -- and so his friend is extremely weak and says, “when they ask you what you can do, say you're a metalworker or tool maker. Anything they can use for the war effort. Don't forget.” “Yes, yes,” Larry mumbled through a haze of fever, hunger and exhaustion. “I'll tell them that.” “Over and over and over again, I told him to say that.” Siggi explained, now he is fast forwarding because when he gets to America, he actually -- one of the first stops. He goes and visits Larry's parents. And so he's telling them the story in the book. And so he's saying, over and over again, I told him to say that. Siggi explained to his parents in frustration years later. If you say you're a metal worker, they're not going to kill you.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He says, "Yes, yes, I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it." And then doesn't say it. He doesn't say it. The Germans shipped him to one of the worst subcamps. That is how 18-year-old Siggi lost track of his best friend with no way of knowing if either of them would survive. And if they did, whether or not they would ever find each other again. So they're at this other camp, I think they're in Austria, if I'm not mistaken. And this is like 2 months later and everybody around them is still dying, and this is just -- this gives you an idea of what he had to survive -- what he had to experience. He was shoved into a barrack with four other men. They all collapsed from exhaustion and in the morning, Siggi woke to find that the other man had died in his sleep. The second night another died, then another, until he was the only one left alive in his bunk. Now look what he has to do here. He arranged the dead bodies next to him as though they were asleep so that when rations were handed out there, when rations were handed out, there would be more stale bread for him to eat, the smell of dead bodies filled the room. And then it is amazing how everything changed overnight. And it's not because the Nazis suddenly said, "Hey, well, we realized the error of our ways." They're constantly getting pressure. And so now the allies, this is American soldiers, have actually -- are penetrating the camp. And so what I just -- the story I just told you, Siggi wakes up the next morning and the Germans are all gone. It's just the prisoners. And so it says the next morning, Siggi solely raised himself up and peeked out of the barrack window, the Germans were gone. And then in the distance on the Hill side was a soldier in a uniform unlike any that he had never seen before. As Siggi watched American tanks and armored cars crash to the gates, prisoners emerge slowly from the barracks shuffling slowly forward and Siggi stumbled along with them. On the day of his liberation, 19-year-old Siggi was skin and bones and weighed less than 90 pounds. He was nearly dead from exhaustion, malnutrition and pneumonia.

And so this is what I just mentioned earlier, what a story. So the U.S. Army, they evacuate the survivors from the camp that Siggi's in, they send them to a Red Cross Hospital in Austria, and he's reunited with his best friend. It gets even crazier. His best friends’ parents has escaped, I don't think they ever explained how they separated from their son but their family is in America whereas their son is lost somewhere in Europe during the war, right? So Siggi and Larry were reunited. Fate had assigned them to the same hospital. Larry showed Siggi a newspaper clipping that featured a photo of himself on the day he was liberated. One of the first American soldiers to enter the camp had taken a photo of Larry. When the soldier returned home, he sold -- this is so crazy, just imagine being in his parents' shoes with what I'm about to read you. When the soldier returned home, he sold the photo to the New York Post and the newspaper ran it on the front page. That's how Larry's parents learn their son has survived the holocaust by seeing his photo on the front page of the newspaper. Can you believe that? Oh, my goodness. Okay. So as I said, the story gets even crazier. The very next paragraph. So -- oh, my goodness, okay, have you ever seen the movie Inglourious Basterds, Brad Pitt, directed by Quentin Tarantino? It's based on true events, obviously, a fictionalized account of true events. But it's these soldiers, these Jewish shoulders have volunteered to go hunt Nazis. Siggi does something very similar to this. It's not exactly the same because he was -- he's recruited because he speaks all kinds of languages. I think he knows German, Polish, and Russian, if I'm not mistaken, I might be wrong about that. And it's not like he's completely fluent as he is in German, but he knows enough. So there is this thing called the U.S. Army Counterintelligence Corps, okay? And so they're going to hire survivors of the concentration camps to go hunt Nazis and Siggi volunteers.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And this is how he gets -- he ends up serving -- it's called the CIC, the Counterintelligence Corps. It's a part of the U.S. Army, okay? He winds up serving them for two years, they get him the -- like past immigration and give him a free ticket to get on a boat and get -- that's how he gets to New York. That's how the story starts where he lands in New York and he is meeting his sister Jenny. It's because of what he does here. And so it says once that you regain sufficient strength, they went to work for the U.S. Army Counterintelligence Corps. So Siggi talked about that. I got a permission to form an armed backup team. Siggi's team was given a jeep and sent out the door. “Let's go hunt some Nazis,” Siggi told his crew. This gave him the chance to capture some of their former Nazi oppressors. And so they wind up going into all these old small towns in Austria and everywhere else. They're just hunting for a lot of Nazis like fled to other parts of Europe, some went to Switzerland, some went to South America, some wind up staying there. So he winds up helping catch. So Joseph Goebbels is like this well-known -- I talked about him a lot on the Churchill podcast I did. And so he was like the Minister of Propaganda for the Nazi party. Well, his brother, they caught him, but they couldn't find -- I know, I think Joseph killed himself if I am not mistaken. He had a brother named Hans they were hunting. Siggi's crew -- these Jewish Nazi hunters wind up staking out his house and finding him, the team rushed up, handcuffed him, and then drove them to CIC headquarters for questioning. And so he winds up -- there's a picture of Hans Goebbels, which is Joseph's brother, being interrogated by the CIC. And then I think you he -- if I am not mistaken, he stands trial for war crimes. They sentenced them life imprisonment, and I think he dies of -- I can't remember if he -- anyways, it doesn't matter. The point being is that Siggi's unbelievable story gets even more unbelievable the fact that they've catch Joseph Goebbels's brother and wind up turning them over to the Americans. And so I want to get to his -- like what he does when he gets to America. I want to wrap this whole section up in November 1947.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

As a thank you note – as a thank you from the CIC for nearly two years of service, 21-year-old Siggi received free passage to New York. On December 12, he arrived in America, looking for work and a new life. Okay. So now we go back to where the story began. 21 years old, no education, thick accent, $200 in his pocket, no skills really to speak of and a mind tormented by just witnessing the darkest period of maybe human history. And so he's going to try to take any job -- I'm going to -- there's a lot going on in these sections. I'm really going to give you like the top highlights, obviously. I really think you should -- I highly recommend reading the book. I think there's a lot of value in actually reading the entire book. But he starts off, very first job. He's hired -- the reason I'm going to read all this to you, or at least the highlights to you is the fact that this isn't something we see over and over again. It's just like you don't know what the future is going -- what the future holds. You can only connect the dots looking backwards to quote Steve Jobs. So what he was -- Siggi has to do is just say, okay, let me take the first opportunity. His first opportunity is shoveling snow for $2 a day. Remember, he dies with a net worth of hundreds of millions of dollars, okay? But he shovel snow, okay, now I'm making $2 a day. That's $14 a week. How can I do a little better than that? So he takes that first opportunity. Saves a little bit of money, gets a second job. His second job, he's working -- remember this point in American history, so a huge industrial base. There's sweatshops all over Manhattan, making all kinds of different products. And so Siggi's just going to take jobs in places that are -- they wind up being very bad for your health. But he's doing whatever he can to try to make money just get to the next step, the next opportunity. So it says the second job was working at sweatshop in downtown Manhattan that manufactured leather goods. So now he's making -- he goes from making $14 a week to now he's making $28.50 a week. His sister is working for a bow tie manufacturer at a bow tie factory. He's like, "Hey, can you give me a job there." Hoping to earn a better living, he convinced her to introduce him to her boss at the bow tie factory. “How much are you earning,” Mrs. Freeman asked. “$36 a week,” Siggi answered, a 20% exaggeration, “And I won't work less for that -- work less than that.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So she goes, "Okay, I'll pay you $36 a week,” so he goes from $14 a week to $28.50 a week. Now he's making $36 a week. And now he's working in a bow tie sweatshop. So then his brother is actually working for a company that manufactures neckties. And so he gets a job there. He said, okay, I can make more money if I sell instead of working in a sweatshop. I will become a salesman. And that's really the way you think Siggi is. His greatest skill in the life is the fact that he was a master salesman. He was a very gifted speaker. We'll go into more details like how he applies that to actually take over oil and banking companies. So he says, "Okay, I'm going to work as a necktie salesman." Why? Because every sale earns him a commission. His friend that saved his life in the concentration camp and the one that then Siggi saves his life on that death march, Larry, he's also there, so he convinces the necktie company to hire Larry as well. They work there for a little bit, then they hear about this other company called National Picture. So everything I'm telling you is taking place over a -- there's a lot more detail. I'm just trying to give you -- to get to the point where he actually starts -- because the subtitle of the book is he became a Wall Street legend. So I got to get to the point where he starts studying the stock market, and that's how he's going to overtake these companies. So then they find National Pictures. They sell like door-to-door stuff. So he starts selling stuff door-to-door, sells stuff like blankets. They have these like lights that you set on top of your TV, like just like little trinkets that -- random things that people might want. So he does that for a while. He saves up money. Then he's going to start his own company. And this is where he actually winds up meeting his wife. And so it says she learned that her boo was entrepreneurial and had recently started a business with another refugee, manufacturing change purses, which they sold to pocketbook and handbag factories. She assumed her parents would be impressed by such an ambitious young man. Her parents were shocked. So he -- no education, not a lot of money. I should tell you, he's 27 years old at this point in the story. So he's been in America for 6 years.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

His wife comes from a extremely wealthy like upper class Jewish family. And so I've written by myself on these pages, he can't catch a break and we're going to see why. She assumed her parents would be impressed by such an ambitious young man. Her parents were shocked. They thought of their daughter dating a refugee, a man with no money or education was intolerable. So they wind up having to elope. Her parents don't know that. 3 weeks later, Siggi showed up at their house to attend the sweet 16 party of Naomi, that's his wife's younger sister. He rang the bell when Naomi's mother, opened the door and saw him. This is what I mean about she -- he can't catch a break. She lunged at him, she lunged at Siggi and smacked him in the face. “Get out,” she yelled, “You're not welcome here.” One of her guests, Rabbi Greenstein, grabbed her arm. “What are you doing?” he said. “This man is a holocaust survivor. You should welcome him.” “I don't care,” Naomi's mother screamed. “Get him out of my house.” And so the reason I bring that to your attention, I think it's actually really important because especially right after I just finished re-reading Ed Thorp biography -- autobiography and I told you, I think he's -- out of anybody else who we studied on the podcast, he's the closest I feel about to like mastering life and really like how to -- he was successful in every area of his life. And something Ed Thorp had, where he was very supportive, he's like, listen, me and my wife decided we're going to spend -- like we're going to give our kids all the education they can possibly want. And teach them how to think for themselves. And then whatever life they choose for themselves, we're going to support them. And I think Ed did that because he realized, hey, the path in my life where I was able to choose for myself, like the ones I like -- what I learned on my own, what I wanted to pursue on my own, those are the things I found most satisfying and I was the best at as far -- and somebody said, "Hey, no, don't do that job that you really want to do, take this other job,” because other people might think it's more prestigious or hey, don't study the subject you're genuinely interested in study this subject because other people might think that it's better, you might make more money in the future."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He realized like those were dead-end paths and that you would never truly excel at something that you weren't -- it wasn't like self-directed or self-driven. So what's interesting to me is the prejudice that his wife's parents had for him saying, "Hey, you're a refugee, you're not good enough for my daughter." He winds up doing the same thing when his kids are growing and they want to date other people, like his daughter wants to date this other person, she actually loves. And he's like, no, that guy is not good enough for you. Like basically, he makes that same mistake. And so his -- Siggi's story is extremely inspiring, don't get me wrong. But he's also flawed. There's a lot of things he does where I think like we can learn like, okay, let's not do that. And I don't want to sit here and like criticize somebody that went through what he went through. I can't -- like I can't even begin to imagine what that was like. But I just want to -- I think it's important, it's like, "Hey, I went to this terrible experience. I didn't like the fact that I was uneducated, but I'm ambitious. I'm working hard. I will provide a great life for my family, your daughter, who I want to marry me" right? Like why didn't you learn not to do that when that was done to you. He would only want his daughters and his sons to marry like people -- they had to be -- obviously, they had to be Jewish. That was obviously very important to him -- yells if you fall in love with the gentile like they should have died in Auschwitz like he's an extreme character. There's a lot of stuff in the book like that, right. But his point is like, no, they have to be Ivy League educated. It was like, but you weren't Ivy League educated, like isn't it more important that they're intelligent and like, okay, what if they -- you weren't -- it sounds like you weren't smart enough to get to the Ivy League, but you were in Auschwitz when other people were college age, like I just am surprised he didn't make that connection, I guess, is my point. So eventually, his in-laws do come around, they realize, okay, he's very motivated. He works extremely hard. He's a workaholic, he doesn't really have -- like that's it. If he's awake, he's working. He's got demons -- he just -- that's what his focus is on, and his entire life is dedicated to that.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so he winds up working his in-laws on like cemeteries and like they manufacture what is it like headstones, bronze and headstones. So he winds up running part of their business. The reason I'm bringing that to your attention is because in his spare time, as he's running this business, he's making a little bit of money, he starts studying the stock market. And this is going to lead him to the career that like where he built his business empire is by doing this. So it says, in his spare time, he studied the stock market. And with the money earned from selling bronze plaques and granite headstones, he purchased modest amounts of stocks. One of his investments was in Wilshire Oil Company. It was a company in Texas. Wilshire seemed like a safe bet. It was a small company, and its stock was affordable. And then this also gives you something an insight into how he ran his businesses later on. He does not believe in diversification, and he was obsessed with accumulating stock. So it says, when Naomi found out her husband was purchasing shares of Wilshire on a regular basis, she chided him. “More stock? We can barely pay the bills and you're buying more stock.” Siggi made excuses, but he didn't stop buying. And this winds up being the turning point in his life because he buys the stock. He winds up going -- they're really entrenched in the Jewish community in New Jersey at the time. And so they go to just like farewell dinner, and he's going to meet this guy, this older entrepreneur named Sol Diamond. And meeting Sol Diamond changes Siggi's life forever. So it says, “among the guests was a businessman named Sol Diamond, a 70-year-old man who was one of New York's most prominent entrepreneurs. Diamond had been a member of the New York Stock Exchange. And after retiring, he parlayed his familiarity with the market to become a major shareholder in mining companies and other businesses. He was discrete about his business success.” “He refrained from bragging, dressed without ostentation, and drove a 20-year-old Cadillac. ‘It still runs. Why would I change it?’ His associates described him as a low-key multimillionaire who didn't try to get on TV or radio or in the papers. He just accumulated stocks.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So they wind up meeting, they wind up talking. They discovered they both own stock in Wilshire Oil Company of Texas. Diamond said he was -- so now Diamond is telling Siggi this, he's saying he's concerned over Wilshire’s failure to realize its potential. The company has a number of deals cooking that could lead to substantial increase in revenues provided that the right person was at the helm. The company needed fresh energy and a charismatic leader. He could lead the takeover himself, Diamond said, but he was approaching 80. Might Siggi consider leading the charge. And so Diamond puts this idea in Siggi's mind, Siggi is, let's see, 40 years younger than Diamond. He's like, why don't we accumulate stock and then let's do a takeover, and then let's pursue -- be more aggressive in pursuing the opportunities that the current ownership is letting lag. That is essentially the idea that Diamond gives to Siggi that Siggi runs with. And so this is going to be the beginning of them plotting to take over this oil company. Siggi was excited about the offer. His options and business so far had only been sales, which limited his income. Heading up an oil company would put them in the big leagues where serious money could be made. He knew nothing -- and this is the story of his life. He knew nothing about natural resources, business finance or how to take over a company, but he had no hesitation accepting Sol Diamond's offer. In Siggi memory, he's like, "Oh, I'm a master toolmaker. I'm a nurse. I'm” -- the same thing. He just like, well, I'll just figure it out. I'm going to -- it doesn't matter, I don't know how to do it now. I can learn how to do it. In Siggi, Diamond saw a real go-getter who would hike to the ends of the earth if need be. Sol Diamond said he would back Siggi financially if Siggi would take up the task of overturning the man who was then President of Wilshire. Siggi welcomed the challenge and the opportunity to show the world that he knew more about business than people gave him credit for. Meanwhile, with as much money as their middle-class income would allow Siggi continued to purchase shares in Wilshire. “I didn't see how this was going to change our life,” his wife said, remembering other stocks, her husband had brought her and other career moves that he had made, but that's how it turned out.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so that's another point where she makes like yes, but you said this about other stocks. Yes, you said this about other business opportunities. He had way more jobs than I listed off to you. And I think that's the great thing, too, where he just -- he had this perseverance. Like, okay, I went down -- I took a risk, it was a dead end. I fell down. I'll get back up, dust myself off, try again. I'm going to go after another opportunity and just go and just -- this guy is relentless over and over again. And so I don't want to mislead you. Like this is a -- this takes years for him to accomplish what's happening here with the oil company. And part of this is the fact that he was just a gifted salesman. And so he was already part of this community. He went to every -- like he did this on like a grassroots individual-by-individual basis. That's also part of the reason why it took so long. To take control of Wilshire Oil Company, Siggi needed to purchase large amounts of company stock. For years, he aggressively solicited family, friends, and acquaintances, enrolling everyone he could to purchase shares of Wilshire and join his investor group. And so this is what I was referencing earlier he is just a master salesperson. Siggi laid out his proposal, if they joined him in purchasing Wilshire stock, eventually they could take control of the company, run it tight -- or run it right, excuse me, and generate substantial earnings for shareholders. The way Siggi explained it, the plan made perfect sense. That was his gift, an ability to convince anyone of anything. People were mesmerized by him. You couldn't review -- refuse Siggi. He attracted people like bees to honey. Everybody was glued to his words and they swallowed everything he served up. “I ended up buying some stock at $7 a share, and so did my father, my son in law, his brother, and -- also invested heavily, and we all made a profit. We were convinced by Siggi's salesmanship. Otherwise, we wouldn't have bought the stock. Who had ever heard of the Wilshire Oil Company of Texas.” By the winter of 1964, that means Siggi would be 38 years old, Siggi and his small group of investors had finally acquired enough stock that he was now in position to address the Wilshire Board in person and assess their response to its takeover bid.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so it took years to work themselves into a position to get to the position he's at right now, and then it goes extremely fast from here. Really quick, I just want to pull out one paragraph from this meeting he’s going to have with the Wilshire Board because this really gives you a look into how he views himself. So it says, "Gentlemen, you're looking at a man who had the fox-like instincts to survive history's darkest hour, a man who has no fear of adversity and who cannot be intimidated by overwhelming odds. The almighty has given me a second chance of life, along with the skills to make great fortunes." So they own such a large percentage, they get I think two seats on the board. He winds up being able to influence management. He's eventually going to be elected CEO of this company. This happens all within a year. Siggi's – I’m fast forwarding a little bit. Siggi's plans were riskier, but the alternative he concluded was to allow Wilshire to continue sinking. “Let him run with it,” McDonald, who is running the company told the Board, run with it Siggi did. He would implement new projects and increase the number of wells. He made every attempt to look like an operator. The first year, Siggi moved forward with the development of 11 exploratory wells. And then he winds up benefiting from this unfortunately the death of the CEO of the company. And really, the way to think about this is he's just extreme -- way more risk-on than the previous management of the company was. Wilshire's President died suddenly of a heart attack. The Board elected Siggi as Wilshire's new President and CEO. It was a remarkably fast rise for Siggi, one that had begun just 3 years after meeting Sol Diamond and only 1 year after Siggi's first meeting with the Wilshire Board. And so now he finds himself as the President and CEO of an oil company, an oil company that used to be owned by Canadians that is in Texas that he's running from New Jersey. His message to stockholders was positive and exciting. So now he's essentially -- like once he becomes the CEO, he's -- instead of selling them to buy the stock, he's selling them on the dream, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The dream of what this company -- not what the company is now, but what it will soon become. His message to stockholders was positive and exciting. The engineers are optimistic about Wilshire's future. The company had great potential. And while not yet profitable, Wilshire owned leases on multiple properties ripe for development. New technologies are coming online, opportunities in the oil industry abounded. And now with the right people at the helm, the future would be prosperous. This is all what Siggi is telling them, right? Stockholders picked up on a not-too-subtle subtext. The old Board members had dragged the company down, men in their senior years who lack the drive and fresh vision to turn potentials into reality. “Their average age was between 80 and dead,” Siggi once commented. And this is such a great like a great line. Like a racehorse pointing his nose at a gap in the field and bursting through to take the lead, Siggi grabbed the moment and ran. So this is another example of what I meant like, okay, I'm going to grab the first opportunity that shoveling snow. Then I'm going to make bow ties. Then I'm going to sell -- then I am going to be door to door salesmen. I'm just going to do every single thing, I'm going to get to the next opportunity once I get to that opportunity, I’m going to look around where is the next place of advancement. So they're doing well. They're starting to -- some of these wells are working out, but he said this is taking too slow. He's like, we need cash. We need a lot more cash because the more cash we can get, the more wells we can drill, the more wells we can drill, the more money we're going to make. And so this is where he gets the idea. He's like, we need to buy a bank, like the audacity of this guy is just amazing. In Siggi's mind, it was not enough. Although these gains are very gratifying. I'm fast forwarding, let's see, 4 -- I think 4 years in the story. Your management is not satisfied since the growth potential of the company has not yet been realized. Siggi's energy and ambitious -- ambition knew no bounds. If Wilshire was going to keep growing, the company would need a steady stream of cash. Why not buy a bank? Banks have lots of cash.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so this idea of getting a bank, he's going to wind up taking over this small -- at the time, a small bank. I think they have like $100 million of assets by the time he dies, when he -- right before he dies, he runs the bank up until he dies. They're going to have like $4 billion of assets. So it's called the Trust Company of New Jersey, and then it's referred in the books by its initials, TCNJ. There is a lot of detail in the book. But I -- really, this one page that I am on is going to tell you, just like half page right here is going to tell you why he wanted to own a bank. This is also going to get them in trouble later. I forgot to tell you, like I said his story is unbelievable. In addition to surviving Auschwitz and coming to the country with no money, dying with hundreds of millions of dollars of net worth, taking over a public traded oil company, taking over a bank, he's also the first person in American history to wind up suing the Federal Reserve. So there's just insane -- and the reason they wind up suing them is because what he's about to do here or they try to get him to divest the oil company from the bank later on. But this is really why like the idea that builds his -- the reason I want to bring this to your attention because this is the idea that Siggi uses that builds his business empire. And so this is why he wants to own a bank. So he says, “the more Siggi learned about the nation's complex tax codes, the more he saw one great benefit in Wilshire taking over the bank. If Wilshire acquired 80% or more of the bank's stock, they could file a consolidated tax return. At that point, the bank would have the right to upstream to Wilshire's tax money otherwise due to the government.” So what does that mean? Instead of writing a check to the IRS for taxes owed on the bank's earnings, TCNJ could legitimately write a check for that amount to Wilshire. So Wilshire is the parent company. The oil company owns the bank, okay? This upstreaming of tax money was perfectly legal and would provide Wilshire with abundant cash to finance its growth.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So that's why he's doing it. He wants the profits of the bank, going to drill more wells and develop the oil companies' earnings, right? The bank would become what Siggi efficiently called his cash cow, supplying Wilshire with large steady streams of development money for opening new wells Okay, I just said that. The arrangement would be potentially -- a potential gold mine. To drill new wells and expand other oil companies had to constantly raise money from outside investors in complex limited partnership agreements. The process was time-consuming and risky. By receiving funding from their own subsidiary, Wilshire could effectively avoid such risks, and this is also one of the main points. There was also a profit motive. No outside investors meant not having to share profits. So he does the exact same thing he did with the oil company. So it's accumulating once you're getting 20% and then 25%, then just buying up, he does tender offers. I think this takes like 2.5 years, I want to say, and here's the punch line, and I just wrote this guy is unstoppable at age 44, Siggi was now the youngest Chairman and CEO of any major bank in the state. Now what's interesting to me is from the rest of the book, and we're about halfway through the book at this point in the story. He's going to live another, let's say, 30 -- something like -- maybe 30 years or something like that. Almost all of the book is about the bank. You very rarely hear about -- he considers himself a banker. And because like he winds up growing this bank. It's in New Jersey. Winds up growing in to be one of the biggest banks in the state of New Jersey. And so this is what the most -- the vast majority of the book is about from here on in. This is an example. And so he would do things. The reason I bring that to your attention is because he would do things -- there's a great essay by Paul Graham that says, do things that don't scale. And it talks about like how when you're a small company, if there's a counterintuitive idea, it’s like you should do things that don't scale. And those -- by doing things that don't scale help you turn into a large company.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so I -- like obviously, Siggi had never read that essay, but he understood that intuitively. And so his whole modus operandi is doing things that don't scale. Just like, hey, I took control of an oil company, and I did that by going door-to-door every friend, every family member, every friend they had, any family member they had and literally going one by one, maybe groups of a handful of people at a time, buy the stock, buy the stock, buy the stock. This is what he does, and he constantly recruits every single person. If you're in an elevator with Siggi, he's like where do you bank and he's going to convert you into a customer. And then he's -- I mean, this guy is insane. There are some things that are like over the line, like the way he talks to people and yells at them is not the nicest person as you could imagine. You'll be sitting in his office. He'll ask you to see your wallet and you're like why do you want to see my wallet, and then he'll go through your wallet and if he notices other ATMs, cards for other banks, he'll cut up the ATM cards right in front of you, say, you're not like -- he'll start crying, saying you're disloyal to him. How dare you? How could you possibly bank with somebody else after everything I've done for you? Like the larger point is that he's got some good ideas in this sense that he does things that don't scale because those things allow him to grow into like a larger bank. It's going to -- by spoiling your customers, which I'll get to in a minute, they bring you more customers. So this is just a note I left myself is like, “we need more of this. What he's about to do here,” which again, from a financial aspect, doesn't make sense. But if somebody did this for you, if a business did this for you, you're going to tell other people. Almost everybody that needs banking services, what they did for you. So he winds up walking in, at this point, he's running the bank, he's on, like he is in the bank all the time. He's traveling around to every single branch, like he's still doing like teller work, like he is -- he never loses the connection to the customer. Another smart thing he does. So it says, he walks in and sees this like women like crying and one of his employees is trying to help her. So he steps in. So as the woman pointed to a number at the bottom of the page.

“I don't have enough money to buy Christmas presents for my family.” She explained in broken English. “I read in the paper that if I join your Christmas club program and save $5 each week, then at the end of the year, I'll have $400. But they say, I only have $260, now I don't know what to do.” She buried her hand in her -- her head in her hands. The manager studied the woman's passbook. You had -- this is what I mean, like the manager is acting logical, but that's not the right move in the situation. It was not like a pure financial transaction here where most businesses think that way, right? The manager studied the women's passbook, “you had to start the contributions in January in order to make the $400 he said, you started in June. All your interest was credited. I'm sorry, but the number is accurate.” Siggi stepped in and moved the manager aside firmly. There's so many stories like this in the book. "Madam, how do you do? I'm Mr. Wilzig. I'm the bank President." Siggi took the passbook and pretended to study the numbers carefully before handing it back to her. “It was our mistake, madam. We miscalculated the interest. The real number is $400. You can buy all your presents, don't be upset.” The woman embraced him. And so this is Siggi's point. TCNJ was not the only bank in town. Customers had options. It would not do to penalize someone because she had not understood the rules. Why give her a reason to switch to another bank. He wanted his customers to be happy. And so before I go back to doing more things, they don't scale and just trying to really spoil your customers and how you keep doing that, your -- word of mouth is going to spread over a long period of time, like this guy owned a bank for multiple decades. It took a long time to grow from -- I think $180 million to $4 billion, if I'm not mistaken. But I have to bring this point out because he's also just like this crazy entertainer. And he's like, he was very -- it's interesting. He had almost like a dual personality in the sense like he was -- he wanted to be respected and admired by other people, but he also didn't care what other people thought.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so like he would just bust down to singing and like dancing in the middle of like public places and really just happy to be alive, if you think about like why wouldn't you be -- when he saw like how precarious life really is. So he says, “he had a beautiful voice and sounded like a professional singer, but he'd sing at the oddest times. He would sing in restaurants, in public places.” “He would dance in aisles. He would be oblivious to everyone around him. The whole world was his stage. Often, he seemed more like an entertainer than a banker. People would ask us,” now this is his children, “’Does your father own the restaurant?’ We’d tell them, no. He's just happy to be alive.” People thought he was nuts and would laugh at him, but he didn't care. We were proud to have a father who could have that much fun and not care about what people around him thought. And just that idea, he's just happy to be alive. No, he doesn't own the restaurant. He's just happy to be alive. And it's funny because he winds up meeting some of its best friends because they move in next door and Siggi had the habit of singing in the shower. And one day, the guy that just moved in, like after several days of hearing this relentless singing, opened the window to the house, he's like “will you shut up,” and then Siggi pops out, and they wind up becoming friends from that. I'm going to go to -- actually no, one more thing before I get to spoiling customers. So when he hires people he's like, "Listen, you don't have to -- he wants you to -- he's like, you're not going to walk as fast as me, talk as fast as I do or think or work as fast as I do, but you have to do all those faster than you think is possible.” So he was really into walking fast, talking fast, and working fast. Some of this is like he saved time because he just wouldn't say goodbye. He'd just like -- you'd be in the room with him. He'd say what he needed done. And like there's no, okay, we're wrapped up. It was like, no, he just left and he did the same thing on the phone. “Abrupt departures, whether from a room or from a phone call, were classic Siggi.” “He had no time for lengthy courtesies and hung up on everybody without saying goodbye. Very often, people would keep talking into a void. And only after hearing the disconnected dial tone, did they realize that he had hung up a long time ago.” And so in the book, there's a lot of examples of him having conversations with customers.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Like I said, he's just constantly -- like, this is the President of the bank, and he's still meeting with people. He ends getting in trouble with the FDIC, gets in trouble with the Fed, gets in trouble with all these other people later on. Like never like -- I don't think he's ever fined. I don't think he goes to jail -- he doesn't go to jail for sure, anything like that. But he's just like in a heavily regulated -- the most regulated business on the planet, which he talks about later, “maybe I shouldn't have entered the most regulated business on the planet.” And he just doesn't -- he doesn't think rules apply to him. He doesn't like people telling him what to do. But the point is, he's like -- he does things that you just wouldn't expect from somebody running this giant bank. And so he's constantly recruiting customers on a one-by-one basis. And so I just want to pull out this exchange that he's having with the customer because I really think that it illustrates like this concept of doing things that don't scale and that if you spoil your customers, if you do what's best for the customers, it's just going to bring you more customers. So as the customer is amazed by Siggi's great rates and couldn't figure out how his bank ever made money. Siggi, he asked, "How can you afford to give me such special treatment?" Siggi answer candidly. “I know that you're going to play golf this weekend at your Country Club with all your friends. When someone says he doesn't like the rates at this bank or tells you his banks turned him down for a loan. Do you know what you're going to say? You're going to say, ‘you must immediately call my friend Siggi, the Chairman of the Board of my bank. He always approves my loans.’ And do you know what your friend is going to reply? ‘The Chairman of the Board of your bank personally approves your loans. What's his number?’ That's why I give you such special treatments that Siggi said, because you will be my goodwill ambassador to all your friends. You will be referring at least one new customer to me each month. And that's how I'm going to make up for the losses I take with you.” Siggi went through this scenario with major customers 3 or 4 times a day, almost every day for years on end. And then his son, who also worked in the bank brings us like -- wraps this up for us. “My father’s strategy was spoiling certain customers in order to create a constant stream of customer referrals from them.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then Siggi also has a really interesting -- I think this is a useful framework. So he has this idea of like differentiating between the employees that you have and realizing they're either a workhorse or a racehorse. And so this is what he means by that. “When evaluating the job performance of his employees, he differentiated between workhorses and racehorses.” “A workhorse was someone who did the minimum, followed the same routine day in and day out, and rarely came up with a great idea.” So that's the workhorse, okay? “A racehorse was someone with potential, an individual who showed initiative, ambition, and the ability to go beyond the call of duty. Of course, you need workhorses in any business,” he explained. “All businesses need people to do the basics, but there's no point spending precious time trying to turn a workhorse into a racehorse.” And so something the book mentions over and over again is that he had one of the largest egos that you could ever find in a human being. He talks about like, "Oh, you can't” -- like he tell his kids later on that, “You can't marry that person because you are the daughter of a genius” -- sorry, “You're the son of a genius.” And so everybody -- like he would yell at people and insult people and he'd call -- his favorite insult was a shmuck. He's like, "Oh, this person is a shmuck, this person -- like that person's a shmuck,” everything else. He was really relentless with the pressure he put on those around him. Like this is a very hard dude, as you can imagine, going -- everything he had experienced, right? And so he put -- relentless with the pressure he put around on people, on those around -- his family members, obviously, people he worked with, but he also could be pretty funny. So this is an example that sometimes they're talking about like he’s kind of a little disrespectful to people at times. But it says, “Sometimes his putdowns were amusing.” “I don't know how so and so could have made this ridiculous investment” he said. “If he's such a great businessman, how could he let himself be suckered into buying something so worthless. Goes to show you, even smart chickens s* on their own feathers,” he would conclude, quoting an old Yiddish saying. I've never heard of that, and that made me laugh. Even smart chickens s* on their own feathers. That sounds like something that Charlie Munger would say, so that's why I started laughing at him. Those who knew him best understood that the humor did little to erase the nightmares of his past.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So there's an entire chapter called Government Schmucks and this is where he starts fighting. He's going to wind up suing the Federal Reserve. And this is like the downside. The good side of having a giant ego is the fact that, hey, I don't know. I'm not tool maker, I can figure how to be a tool maker. I'm not a nurse. I will figure how to make a nurse -- be a nurse, right? I'm doing that for literal life and death. Once I get to America, like I'm learning on the job, I don't know how to -- I don't know much about stocks. I can teach myself about stocks. I don't know how to run an oil company, I can teach -- so it's like that's the good side of having the supreme self-confidence is ego. I always think of -- I look for any excuse to regurgitate this quote from Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari. I've told you, I don't know, a dozen -- probably a dozen times on past podcasts about this because I think he's dead on. And what Nolan realized is not only that, like he was one of the first -- when Nolan was founding technology companies, it was very rare for the founder to actually run the technology company, right? At that time, they would start the company and then they would bring in older management. And so Nolan Bushnell was one of the -- he laid the foundation for a lot of these technology company founders and CEOs to actually maintain control of their company, right? He was doing that in the 80s. And so he noticed something about his own life, but also Steve Jobs, who was -- he worked for Nolan. He was like 10 years younger than Nolan. And so he says, perhaps everyone has creative potential, but only the arrogant are self-confident enough to press their creative ideas on others. Steve believed he was always right and was willing to push harder and longer than other people who might have had equally good ideas, but who caved under pressure. So the reason I bring that up is because that's counterintuitive. Most people say, "Hey, don't be arrogant, don't -- be humble whatever the case is." And no one's saying, no, if you're humble, like you're going to lose. And so you see that with Siggi. He says right here. Siggi had a deep-rooted hatred of authority. He could not tolerate anyone telling him what to do. The animosity was very deep-seated and very obvious. So that's beneficial when he's building his career.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It also gets him into trouble with the Federal Reserve. He winds up then to sue them with the FDIC, with the SEC, with all these other regulators because he did not -- he would not listen to other people. He thought he knew better. He literally calls -- the reason the chapter I'm in is called Government Schmucks it's because they would tell him -- they would give him an order to do things, he’s like, “I'm not doing this,” and it's like you'd have to hire attorneys, and they'd have these huge fights and he was convinced that he knew better. And in some cases, he was right. If they try to get them to divest his real estate because the real estate on the books and on this bank were -- like there was a recession and they went -- the value dropped. And so the regulators like you have to sell this, get it off your books. He's like, “you idiot. This real estate is 5 miles from New York City, real estate is cyclical. I'm not selling.” They have this huge fight. Somehow, he avoids having to sell it and then he went on coming back and doubling what he made on the real estate. So he's actually right in that example. So this is -- there's a very complicated story in the book. This paragraph is really going to tell you like, what his fight with the Federal Reserve was all about. And don't worry about the name of these acts and these laws because the book talks about the laws change constantly, they're renamed or updated. But at this point, the Fed is saying, "Hey, an oil company cannot have ownership of a bank, you have to divest, you have to separate your 2 holdings", right? And he didn't want to do that. So it says the Fed officer cited the Bank Holding Company Act, the BHC Act, which stipulated that a nonbanking company could not own or operate a commercial bank. The assumption behind the BHC Act. They said was that an oil man, like Siggi knew nothing about banking and that his risky oil drilling jeopardized the bank customers' money. “Siggi,” the federal office said, “you have been -- we have notified nearly 400 parent companies across the U.S. that they must get rid of their banking subsidiaries. Your company is the only holdout.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so another thing about Siggi is the fact that he's highly leveraged and yet all of his wealth is concentrated in his company. He also has constant stress and health problems. He's a constant workaholic. He's constantly worried about his business. So there's just some -- this gives you an idea of like how he thought about asset allocation. And then even when he's about to have quadruple bypass surgery, listen to what he says to his daughter. His daughter has to come in. There's some complicated way to get around these regulations, his daughter ones up running one of the companies, but she's really like -- he still has control like he steps aside, but he's still in control. So there's a bunch of that in the book as well. “As a further consequence of the constant buying of stock, Siggi was forever cash poor. Whatever wages, bonuses or cash dividends he earned, he used to pay down his margin loans or else buy more stock in his two companies.” He had -- he was this high and mighty CEO of a bank, collecting a huge salary and huge bonuses every year, and no one suspected he was often desperate for cash. That's where some of his migraine headaches came from. His fortune was tied up in those stocks. He had heart problems and was about to undergo -- now this is his daughter telling us the story. “He had heart problems, he was about to undergo a quintuple bypass operation. On the gurney, he called me close to him, and I was expecting him to say something like ‘Sherry, I love you. Thanks for staying with me.’ Instead, he motioned for me to bend down so he could whisper in my ear and said, ‘Sherry, I want you to buy 300 shares of trust company stock, but you have to do it today, quick before 4:00 when the market closes.’” And so eventually, the FDIC, the Fed, the SEC, he does have to make some structural changes to his business and says, he fumed over having been forced to make so many changes. But these were the rules of banking, and he had no choice but to comply. I don't think there was ever a time that my father truly enjoyed banking for banking's sake. He loved making himself and others happy and rich and banking was almost necessary evil for doing that. Sometimes he would say, "I should have my head examined for picking the most regulated business in the world, state regulations, federal regulations, SEC regulations. What could be more stressful?"

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He hated taking orders from anyone. And so I mentioned earlier, it's just really hard on everybody around him, including his kids. And so then he answers the question. It's like, “why are you such a hard-a** to your children,” and he's just got a great line here. “Father,” his son asked him, "Why do you bust my chops mercilessly over every single decision at the bank?" “Because I'm not going to be around forever,” Siggi replied. “And if you can tolerate me over and over, then you'll be able to stand up to anyone after I'm gone.” And this is the great line that he ends the advice to his son. This is fantastic. "Never give up. Only death is permanent. Everything else can be fixed." And this is his record right before he finds out that he's dying. Siggi had grown his bank from $180 million in assets to more than $4 billion by the year 2000, all without mergers or acquisitions. And so he did not take care of his health. He worked all the time. Wouldn't go to the doctor. And so he's wind up staying at -- staying in a friend’s house or going to take a trip the next day and it says -- these are the people that he met when he was singing. It says, “during the night, they heard Siggi throwing up. They ran upstairs and found the bathroom covered with blood and Siggi sprawled on the floor.” They put him in their car and raced him to the hospital, where x-rays and blood work revealed that stage -- that he had Stage IV advanced multiple myeloma, which is an incurable blood cancer that had ravaged Siggi's body. And so he's very close to dying. He's in the hospital and he has a saying that he said throughout his life. That he's like, "I'm still in Auschwitz. I'm still in Auschwitz." It's like basically saying like, you can never outrun these memories. And so he's going to want to -- let me just read this to you, and you'll see like the – unfortunately winds up being literal.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The doctor studied his declining numbers in recommended Decadron, which attacks cancer with greater potency than any other steroid, although the drug could bring on serious side effects, amnesia, confusion, dizziness, nausea, insomnia, and hallucinations. And so Siggi's friend, the one that discovered him throwing up and took him to the hospital is a doctor. So Siggi's doctor friend, Jerry Quint warned that resorting to Decadron carried risks. “I get calls from the police,” he told them. “They find patients on Decadron walking down highways naked. It makes you insane.” Siggi had no choice. He was deteriorating and gave doctors permission to begin the aggressive treatment. At times, under the drug's influence, Siggi imagined he was not in a New York City Hospital but in a concentration camp. He found a pencil and drew maps of the hallways, nursing stations, and laundry shoots. He memorized routes and noted obstacles between his hospital room and the outside world. Remember, it's not a hospital from the time he's in a concentration camp. And he showed the drawings to Sherry, his daughter, who was always by his side, and whispered that this is how he planned to escape. The memories of Auschwitz were so vivid that he sensed the SS were lurking in closets and peering around the edges of corridors. When doctors wanted to put them inside an MRI scanner, he refused saying it looked like a crematorium. So he winds up getting a release from the hospital, he's not doing really well, and he winds up being able to survive. He wanted to make it to his son's birthday. And so his son comes to visit Siggi at his apartment, at his condo. And he says, when he arrived at his father's apartment, he found him sitting on the dining room table. Siggi pointed with glee at the cake and candles and colored sugar words and snow-white frosting. “Happy Birthday,” Siggi called out weakly. His thin arms raised in delight. The nurse lit the candles and with whatever strength he could muster, Siggi saying in a slow trembling voice. “Happy Birthday, Happy birthday to you, Ivan, my dear, Happy Birthday to you,” gesturing as best as he could.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He ended the song and pointed for his son to blow out the candles, which he did. Siggi was rushed to the hospital the next morning. He died that night. Less than a year after his death, his state was worth hundreds of millions of dollars, “not bad,” as Siggi once said, “for a short bowlegged Jew with flat feet who never graduated kindergarten and started with only $240 in his pocket.” And that is where I'll leave it. There's so much more in the book, highly recommended. It was a fantastic -- it was a fascinating story, something that's very entertaining and you learn at the same time.

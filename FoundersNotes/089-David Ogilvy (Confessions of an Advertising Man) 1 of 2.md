And if it's easy, there's going to be hundreds and hundreds of competitors naturally, because humans don't like doing hard things. The amount of people that like doing hard things is a tiny, tiny percentage of the overall population. It's probably a high percentage of population of people to listen to this. But in general, you can like -- and that's the weird thing being exposed these ideas all the time, like you become normal, I think like these excessive traits are normal? Are these uncommon traits are normal? Be a better way to put that. But when you -- I'm reminded that when you get on the general population, like, "Oh, like no one thinks about this". And just having that mind frame is such a huge advantage. So I don't know, I love that point. Okay. So the book is short. I'm going to close here. He's got the last chapter. I've told you before, I'm a sucker for aphorism. So I'm going to just read the aphorisms that he has in this book, some of them in his last chapter, some of them you heard before, and I'm not going to elaborate on all of them. I want you to just -- they can sit in your mind and you can take them wherever you want to go. First one, "I believe in the Scottish proverb, 'Hard work never killed a man. Men die of boredom, psychological conflict, and disease. They do not die of hard work.'" The second one, "Big ideas are usually simple ideas."

"My mother was a beautiful and eccentric Irishwoman. She disinherited me on the ground that I was likely to acquire more money than was good for me without any help from her. I could not disagree. At the age of nine, I was sent to board at an aristocratic school in Eastbourne. The headmaster wrote of me, he has a distinctly original mind, inclined to argue with his teachers and to try and convince them that he is right and the books are wrong; but this perhaps is further proof of his originality. At the age of 13, I went to a Scottish school whose Spartan disciplines had been established by my great uncle. I went to college at Oxford, but I was too preoccupied to do any work, and was duly expelled. That was in 1931, the bottom of the depression. For the next 17 years, while my friends were establishing themselves as doctors, lawyers, civil servants, and politicians, I adventured about the world, uncertain of purpose. I was a chef in Paris, a door-to-door salesman, a social worker in the Edinburgh slums, an associate of Dr. Gallup in research for the motion picture industry, an assistant in British Security Coordination, and a farmer in Pennsylvania. I had expected to become Prime Minister when I grew up. Instead, I finally became an advertising agent on Madison Avenue; the revenues of my 19 clients are now greater than the revenue of her Majesty's Government. My father used to say of a product that it was 'very well spoken of in the advertisements.' I spend my life speaking well of products in advertisements. By writing this book in the old-fashioned first-person singular, I have committed an offense against a convention of contemporary American manners. But I think it artificial to write we when I'm confessing my sins and describing my adventures."

That is an excerpt from the book that I read this week and the one I'm going to talk to you about today, which is Confessions of an Advertising Man by David Ogilvy. And before I jump into the rest of the book, I just want to let you know why I chose to do -- to cover this book this week. I had previously done, if you've listened to all the episodes I have done so far, you already know this, but on Founders podcasts #82, I went over what I learned from David's book, Ogilvy on Advertising, which is less biographical and more like explicit advice on how to improve your company's advertising. So if that subject interest you and you have not listened to that, I'd highly recommend listening to Founders #82. He does a little bit of that in this book as well, but this is more of like a narrative as opposed to the way that he organized the other book. They're also written about 2 decades apart. If I'm not mistaken, he wrote Ogilvy and Advertising like in the '80s, and the book I have on my hand was first published in 1963. But -- so I was obviously familiar with David Ogilvy. But the reason I'm doing it today is because the last, last week, I did probably the hardest podcasts I've ever done, which is I read 54 years of Warren Buffett shareholder letters. And it's easily the longest book that I've ever read for this podcast and the long podcast. It's like over 3 hours long. But in several shareholder notes -- so first of all, Warren Buffett calls David Ogilvy in the shareholder letters a genius. And in the shareholder letters, you also see some of the Berkshire would publish like which -- like stocks they own. And I noticed not only did he call David a genius, but he also owned stock in David's advertising agency, which is Ogilvy & Mather. So once I read that, I was like, okay, well, if Warren Buffett, who everybody else looks up to is learning from and admiring the talents of David Ogilvy, then I should read this book right away and see what we can all learn from them. So that's how you're hearing this now. So let me go ahead and jump into the book. I want to start at the beginning. He writes this like updated foreword. This is him writing in 1988, and he adds this extra chapter on the book. It's called The Story Behind this Book. And he's got some interesting insights.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And you're going to see his personality right away. So he says, "Fourteen years before writing these Confessions, I had gone to New York and started an advertising agency. Americans thought I was crazy. What could Scotsman know about advertising?" And this next sentence gives you an idea of the personality he has, and I would describe it as he definitely has an abundance of confidence. He says, "My agency was an immediate and meteoric success." He says, "I wrote this book during my summer vacation in 1962. I thought it would sell about 4,000 copies. To my surprise, it was a runaway bestseller and so far, has sold about 1 million copies. Why did I write it? First, to attract new clients to my advertising agency; second, to condition the market for a public offering of our shares; and third, to make myself better known in the business world. It achieved all three of these purposes." And it continues, "he says my colleagues at Ogilvy & Mather have largely followed my precepts, and they have sold a lot of products for a lot of manufacturers with the result that our agency is now 60x as big when I wrote this book," that's crazy. So on the very next page, I left a note for myself, and the note says, "he is very, very, very good at one thing." So he says, "if you detect a slight stench of conceit in this book, I would have you know that my conceit is selective. I am a miserable duffer in everything except advertising. I cannot read a balance sheet, work a computer, ski, sail, play golf, or paint. But when it comes to advertising, Advertising Age," this is the publication, "says that I'm the creative King of advertising. When Fortune Magazine published an article about me and titled it, 'Is David Ogilvy a Genius?' I asked my lawyer to sue the editor for the question mark." So it's interesting what came into my mind when I read that paragraph and then obviously reading the entire book, you get an understanding of how David thinks. And I kind of tied it into like, well, like let me start with one thing like I'm pretty skeptical of the notion of institutionalized learning. I feel like in my own life, like the things that I was generally interested in, the ones I sought out myself and wanted to learn about whether reading books, listening to lectures, taking class, whatever it is, those are the things that I remember and use in life. And anything that was like forced fed or forced to do that I was not interested in, like went in 1 year and not the other. So then I think about this as like, well, my experience is surely not unique, right? I'm sure a lot of people have the same experience and I say, "What would you tell your child? Like if they're asking, "Hey, what is the advice you have to help me become more successful in life." And I think this is it. Now you should have a broad understanding of the world around you and be -- and learn about a bunch of different things. But I think when it comes to your craft, the surest way to be successful is to be very, very, very good at one thing. David Ogilvy, when he was alive, was arguably the best person in the world at advertising. And as a result, that made him successful and gave them this set of unique experiences.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But like you saw, when I opened the podcast, he had to go through a lot of experimentation to figure out what that one thing is, like he said in the beginning of the book, like he was a chef, he was a door-to-door salesman, he was a social worker, he was a researcher, and then a farmer in Pennsylvania. He is actually, I think, like where the large Amish population is in Pennsylvania. So I don't know why that popped into my mind when I read that, but it did. So I thought I'd share it with you. All right. So I want to continue with the section that he's talking about, which is the story behind the book, and he's kind of reflecting 20-something years, 25 years after it's published. And he talks about -- this is also something I noticed in the Warren Buffett shareholder letters, like David has these concepts that he's learned through trial and error, research, and experience, and he kind of repeats them over and over and over again. And Warren does the same thing. Like he has, in 54 years, it's not like every single shareholder letter, he's introducing a new idea. What he's doing, he gives you a set of ideas, maybe there's five, maybe there's six, whatever the number is. And then he gives you different examples of how he uses the principles that he feels and the philosophies he has in business and how it -- like how he applies it to what he's actually doing. David does the same thing. And so he talks about, "Hey, like in my day, there was no such thing as corporate culture. No one talked about it. We just -- you just created it. You didn't know what you were doing." And so now he's talking about like the ideas and they're called Ogilvy-isms. He repeats them over and over again. So he says, "through maddening repetition, some of my ideas have been woven into our culture. Here are some of them." So I just picked out a few that I found interesting. Here's one, "We sell or else." And so he means there is like too much of the advertising world is they chase things that are not important. So he says, "What is advertising?" In his definition, it's salesmanship at scale, right? He doesn't write ads to win awards. He doesn't write ads, so other people can think how clever that ad is. He talks about, in fact, if your ad is noticed for being clever, it's probably not beneficial because your main goal should be to sell. He's like, "I write ads to sell the products of my customers". That's it. So we sell or else. That's the first thing he repeats over and over again. He says, "You cannot bore people into buying your product, you can only interest them in buying it."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This one I love so much, "We prefer the discipline of knowledge to the anarchy of ignorance. We pursue knowledge the way a pig pursues truffles. A blind pig can sometimes find truffles, but it helps to know that they grow in oak forests." So one thing he credits the immediate success he had into advertising was, he says he's the only person running one of the largest advertising agencies in America that spent time as a researcher first. So he referenced it earlier. He says, "I worked with Dr. Gallup, you might recognize that name because think about all the polls that are referenced, and all the intelligence gathered by the Gallup organization." So understanding the experience he had and how he applied what he learned -- basically, he says, "Listen, there's nobody else to study consumer behavior like me. And so I actually know why people buy products and then I orchestrate my advertisements around the traits that make people buy products." So knowing that, it makes perfect sense where he says, "Listen, I prefer the discipline of knowledge to the anarchy of ignorance." He says, "Unless your campaign contains a big idea, it will pass like a ship in the night." He says, "I doubt if more than one campaign in 100 contains a big idea. I'm supposed to be one of the more fertile inventors of big ideas. But in my long career, I've had -- I've not had more than 20." And this is another thing he repeats all the time, and I'll talk more about this in a little bit. He says, "Search all the parks in your cities. You'll find no statues of committees." So he's not -- he hates committees. He really very much believes in the power of an individual. A few pages later, he's just going -- talking about like what he sees, the evolution in the advertising agency, but a lot of the insights he has, again, can be applied to many things. He says, "Clients who haggle over their agency's compensation are looking through the wrong end of the telescope. Instead of trying to shave a few measly cents off the agency's 15%, they should concentrate on getting more sales results from the 85% they spend on time and space," meaning all the ad buys they're doing. "That is where the leverage is. No manufacturer ever got rich by underpaying his agency, pay peanuts and you get monkeys." And that paragraph could have easily been written by Warren Buffett who talks about that a lot in the shareholder letters. I see why he admires -- why Buffett admires Ogilvy, now reading both like reading like the result of their writing.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

They have a lot of the same ideas where Buffett says he credits like Charlie Munger with pushing them in the direction of not focusing solely on price, but really focusing on the value that you get. This is Ogilvy telling us the study experience. He says, "Advertising agencies will waste their clients' money repeating the same mistakes. During a 10-hour train ride, I read all the ads in three magazines. Most of them violated elementary principles, which were discovered in years gone by. The copywriters and art directors who created them are ignorant amateurs. What is the reason for their failure to study experience? Are they afraid that knowledge would impose some discipline on them or expose their incompetence?" So now he explicitly lists like some of the most valuable lessons that he's learned. I just picked out a few that I thought were interesting. "The temptation to entertain instead of selling is contagious." It goes back to that point; he's going to reiterate that point in a bunch of different ways. He's going to take the same idea and dress it up in different language, but it's the same thing over and over again. Your ad sells. That is your primary goal, focus on that, stop trying to entertain people. He says that doesn't mean be boring, though. "The difference between one advertisement and another, when measured in terms of sales, can be as much as 19:1." Okay, so that is -- he also references that in Ogilvy on Advertising. So I really do believe if you're selling any kind of product, you should pick up the Ogilvy on Advertising book. It's not like the book I have in my hand looks like a normal book, right? I mean, he's -- Ogilvy is a fantastic writer who gets right to the point. So this is like a real short concise 180 pages with like no fluff in there. But Ogilvy on Advertising is like this big, beautiful example with a lot of pictures. It's almost like a course on advertising in Book form. And in it, he explicitly tells you like what to do based on his own experience, which he gained through research and through years and years of trying to solve the people's products. And the reason I bring that up is because he talks about this a lot. And that's insane. Think about what he's saying, "If you study advertising, you get really good at it. You could be doing the same act, but the difference in the outcome," so the same input, right? But the output is completely different in the sense that one ad can sell 19x as much as another ad. So he says, "It pays to study," this is also applicable to other things. "It pays to study the product before writing your advertisements," and he's going to talk more about that later. He takes us to an extreme. And I think it's a good idea. "The key to success is to promise the consumer a benefit," something he hammers in Ogilvy on Advertising as well, like "better flavor, wider wash, more miles per gallon, a better complexion." This is something I find that a lot of people overlook where like, my belief is a lot of our behavior is biological. I'm not doubting that there's influences on different cultures, but humans are basically the same everywhere.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so he arrives at the same point, the advertising equivalent. What works in one country almost always works in other countries. So my point being is like we're all way more similar than we are different. "Most campaigns are too complicated. They reflect a long list of objectives and try to reconcile the divergent views of too many executives. By attempting to cover too many things, they achieve nothing. Their advertisements look like the minutes of a committee." There he goes again. He really, really cannot stand committees. You could tell he kind of ran his businesses, much as like an individual at scale, like a leverage of his -- like he institutionalized his thoughts and that gave his experience leverage and he's able to scale up to whatever, 60x the size of the business that it was when he's writing these words. "Good campaigns can run for many years without losing their selling power. My eyepatch campaign for Hathaway shirts ran for 21 years. My campaign for Dove soap has been running for 31 years, and Dove is now the best seller." So he's just saying, "Listen," and he chastises other people, he says, "People get bored running the same ads, but why would you stop running an ad if it's still working." And it just echoes a main theme of this podcast, like why would you study history because human nature is constant. Okay. So let me jump, now we're back into the book. So every chapter has like an explicit, like how to -- so to say, how to manage an advertising agency, how to make good campaigns, how to write potent copy, how to build great campaigns, et cetera, et cetera. But in what he does is he kind of like weaves a narrative, so he tells the stories. He has an idea to tell a story why that -- like give an example of why it's important. So it's not like a dry book at all. I got to the end of the book. So the other day, I saw this video, I'm a huge fan of stand-up comedy.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I was listening to like -- I saw this video where the comedian Kevin Hart is talking about him and Chris Rock were doing, like they're just like practicing at the stand-up club one night. And so they -- him and Chris have a good relationship. So when each watch each other's stand-up sets and then give each other advice and they write it down and they talk about it so they can kind of like share ideas. And they said, Dave Chappelle walked in, and he went up and he said, Kevin Hart and Chris Rock were sitting in the back while Dave Chappelle was doing a stand-up, and this is probably 10 years ago or something like that. And 20 minutes into Dave's set, Kevin is like, me and Chris looked at each other, then we looked at the notes we've just given each other, and we crumbled them up and throw it in the trash. He's basically saying that Dave Chappelle was so good at comedy that it just made what they were doing look so bad. I felt that way when I finished this book because I was like maybe one day like I want to write a book about like the stuff I've learned from reading on his biographies and I was just like, I will never be able to write like this guy. He's just so good at it. All right. So that was a tangent. Let me jump into this and let's start actually focusing on what we're doing here. Okay. “So the lessons you learned can be applied to other fields. These are my notes," what he learned from the hedge chef. So he was -- like he said, this is what he learned when he was a chef in Paris. So he starts off, "Managing an advertising agency is like managing any other creative organization, a research laboratory, a magazine, an architect's office and a great kitchen. 30 years ago, I was chef at the Hotel of Majestic in Paris. There were 37 chefs in our brigade. From morning to night, we sweated and shouted and cursed and cooked. Every man was inspired by one ambition, to cook better than any chef that it ever cooked before. I've always believed that if I could understand," and he's talking about the head chef, his name was Monsieur Pitard. I don't know how you pronounce it, but I'm never going to try to say that Monsieur word again. So let's just call this guy P. "I've always believed that if you got to understand how Monsieur Pitard, the head chef, inspired such a white-hot morale, I could apply the same kind of leadership to the management of my advertising agencies," and now he's going to go into some of the stuff he observed. He says, "Mr. Monsieur Pitard," I'm going to call Mr. P that's actually better. "Mr. Monsieur Pitard praised very seldom, but when he did, we were exalted to the skies. Today, I praise my staff as rarely as Mr. Monsieur Pitard praised his chefs in hope that they too will appreciate a more than a steady gush of appreciation.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Mr. Monsieur Pitard did not tolerate incompetence. He knew that it is demoralizing for professionals to work alongside incompetent amateurs." So one of David's most famous quotes and something that's also quoted in the Warren Buffett shareholder letters. So he says, "If each of us hires people who are smaller than we are, we should become a company of dwarfs. But if each of us hires people who are bigger than we are, we should become a company of giants." And that's kind of the lesson he's teaching us here that he observed from this chef in Paris, who had unbelievably high standards. He said, "Mr. Monsieur Pitard taught me exorbitant standards of service. For example, he once heard me tell a waiter that we were fresh out of," it's a French dish, I'm not going to try to pronounce, "and almost fired me for it. In a great kitchen, he said, one must always honor what one has promised on the menu." So David tells us -- this ended over here, he's trying to first not become fired, but he's like, "This is my thinking, like we don't have the ingredients that we need, if I can go to the store and go get the ingredients, it's going to take too long because the dish takes 50 minutes to cook and what do you want me to do?" And Mr. Monsieur Pitard's like, "You do anything that you have to." He's like, "You should have come to me. I would have called around other restaurants that have that same dish. We would have went out and got it for them." And he's basically saying, "Hey, we're the ones that promised the customer." We put -- we're making a promise of the customer by putting this dish on the menu. And it's our fault that we were not prepared. So we're not going to penalize the customer for the fact that we didn't prepare correctly. We're going to do the extra work responsible to deliver what we promised benefit to the customer. Again, I think that applies to almost every single demand. All right. So more lessons here, "I learned something else at the Majestic. If you can make yourself indispensable to a client, you will never be fired." That's another principle that David talks about in different ways, different stories. And then he says, so this is what he feels the founder of a company's principal responsibility is, "I have come to the conclusion that the top person has one principal responsibility, to provide an atmosphere in which creative Mavericks can do useful work." So he says the same point in another one of his most famous quotes. And again, if I didn't tell you this was a quote from David Ogilvy, you could easily think it's a quote from Warren Buffett, like it's striking to see the similarities in their thinking. And David said, "Hire people who are better than you -- who are better than you are and then leave them to get on with it, look for people who aim for the remarkable who will not settle for the routine."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And that was Warren, his point, like "Decides to buy businesses and we leave the CEOs alone because they're already fantastic businesses. They clearly know what they are doing. And if I was running the business, I would do a worse job. So who am I to tell them what to do? It just doesn't make any sense." So he just focuses on capital allocation, which is saying, "Hey, all the profits of the business I own, send them back to me, and I'll make them -- turn them into more money, but I'm certainly not going to tell you what to do." This is a little bit about behavior that he admires. "So once a year, I assembled the whole brigade," meaning everybody in the company, "to the auditorium of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and give them a candid report on our operations, profits, and all, then I tell them the kind of behavior I admire in these terms." So that's why he was referencing earlier, the way he communicate and reinforce like his beliefs over and over again, that's what gave the culture that Ogilvy & Mather had. It's not that he sat down and said, "Hey, I'm going to create a corporate culture. No one even knew that meant at the time". It's just saying, this is what we believe in. So I'm just going to read all this to you, and this is going to be quite long because I think it's worth our attention. Number one, "I admire people who work hard, who bite the bullet. I dislike passengers who don't pull the weight in the boat. It's more fun to be overworked than to be underworked. There's an economic factor built into hard work. The harder you work, the fewer employees we need and the more profit we make. The more profit we make, the more money becomes available for all of us."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Number two, "I admire people with first-class brains because you cannot run a great advertising agent without brainy people, but brains are not enough unless they are combined with intellectual honesty." Three, "I have an inviable rule against employing ness pot -- knee pots and spouses because they breed politics. Whenever two of our people get married, one of them must depart." Number four, "I admire people who work with Gusto. If you don't enjoy what you are doing, I beg you to find another job. Remember the Scottish proverb, "Be happy while you're living, for you're a long-time dead." That's a fantastic proverb. "I despise totes who suck up to their bosses. They are generally the same people who bully their subordinates. I admire self-confident professionals, the craftsman who do their jobs with superlative excellence. They always seem to respect the expertise of their colleagues. They don't poach." And number seven, "I admire people who hire subordinates who are good enough to succeed them." That's a sign of leadership. "I pity people who are so insecure that they feel compelled to hire inferiors as their subordinates." That's how you become, like he said, a company of dwarfs. Number eight, "I admire people who build up their subordinates because that is the only way we can promote from within the ranks. I did test having to go outside to fill important jobs, and I look forward to the day when that will never be necessary." Number nine, "I admire people with gentle manners who treat other people's human beings. I abhor quarrelsome people. I abhor people who wage paper warfare. The best way to keep the peace is to be candid." And number 10, "I admire well-organized people who deliver their work on time. The Duke of Wellington never went home until he had finished all the work that was on his desk."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

All right. Here's another idea I love, "Pursue excellence over bigness. I have no ambition to preside over a vast bureaucracy. That is why we have only 19 clients. The pursuit of excellence is less profitable than the pursuit of bigness, but it can be more satisfying." This distaste for bureaucracy, again, if you've ever listened to or read the writings of both Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger, I'm going to say it's over and over again because it's interesting how they learn from each other or maybe they just arrived at these conclusions separately, and just happened to be of like minds, but they abhor bureaucracy. I think Berkshire Hathaway is probably the most uniquely structured super conglomerate that I've ever come across. This is some Ogilvy's thoughts on talent and imagination, and I love this idea of making yourself formidable. All right. So he says, "Talent, I believe, is most likely to be found among non-conformists, dissenters and rebels, misfits. The majority of businessmen are incapable of original thinking because they are unable to escape from the tyranny of reason. Their imaginations are blocked." Check this out, this is such an interesting thought or a sentence rather, "I am almost incapable of logical thought, but I have developed techniques for keeping open the telephone line to my unconscious in case that disorderly repository has anything to tell me." What a unique description, do you see what I mean about like I'll never be able to write this well. Like I mean, obviously, he's been a copyrighter for years, too, so he's had plenty of practice, but he describes his unconscious as a disorderly repository. That's amazing. So he says, "I keep the telephone line open to my unconscious. I hear a great deal of music. I take long baths. I garden. I go into retreat among the Amish. I watch birds. I go for long walks in the country. I take frequent vacations so that my brain can lie fallow, no golf, no cocktail parties, no tennis, no bridge, no concentration, only a bicycle.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

While thus employed in doing nothing, I receive a constant stream of telegrams from my unconscious and they become the raw material for my advertisements, but more is required. Hard work on open mind and ungovernable curiosity." So think about the three traits that you could see in other people. Are you ever going to meet anybody that is a hard -- that works hard at whatever they're interested in. So to me, it's more like craftsmanship, I would replace hard work for, an open mind and un-governable curiosity. Like that's -- those are going to be appealing characteristics to almost anybody. And the opposite of them, let's say, sloth, a closed mine, and somebody thinks they know everything, like those are people that repel you, right, like the people that you're going to run away from in life. So I don't know, I like that. I want to be thought of as taking my craft seriously. I want to have an open mind and I want to have un-governable curiosity. He says, "I have observed that no creative organization, whether it is a research laboratory, a magazine, a Paris kitchen, an advertising agent, or an advertising agency will produce a great body of work unless it is led by a formidable individual." So this goes back to his distaste of committees. And of course, like, listen, it's kind of obvious here like he's got a giant ego and probably deservingly so. He clearly thinks of himself as a formidable individual. Now some could argue it's probably better to keep that thought to yourself just if you want to like, in general, humans find like arrogance and stuff like that, distasteful.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But I don't -- like there's plenty of people that I learned from that are considered arrogant. Like I just don't let that get in my way of a good idea, like I don't care about it. But I do think his idea here is really, really smart. And as a goal, like why would you not? Like we have limited time on the earth, why wouldn't you want to tap into all the talents that you possess and you currently have materialized? And one way to do that is becoming a formidable individual. I really like that idea a lot. And he's saying, listen -- I mean I would agree based on what the 80-something books that I've read so far for the podcast, not one of them is not a formidable individual, not one. They all are, I guess, this is a better way instead of doing a negative there, like they all are formidable individuals. Okay. Let's skip ahead a little bit. What is this? He wrote down his goal no matter how delusional it sounded, oh, this is really good. This is bananas. So he says, "15 years ago, I was an obscure tobacco farmer in Pennsylvania. Today, I preside over one of the best advertising agencies in the United States, arguably in the world, with billings of $55 million and a payroll of $5 million." He says, "How did this come to pass? As my Amish friends have said, it wonders me. On the day in 1948, when I hung out my shingle, I issued the following order of the day." So he -- no clients. He's just like, I'm going to do this even though he has no -- like other than his time at Gallup, which probably gives him an unfair advantage, like he didn't have money, there's nothing that would lead one to believe that he's going to be successful to the degree that he was successful, right? And you're talking about lesson was it less than 20 years later? And this is what he wrote down. This is amazing to me. He says, "This is a new agency, struggling for its life. For some time, we should be overworked and underpaid. In hiring, the emphasis will be on youth. We are looking for young Turks. I have no use for totes or hacks. Agencies are as big as they deserve to be. We are starting this one on a shoestring, but we are going to make it a great agency before 1960." So he gave myself a 12-year goal there. "The next day, I made a list of the 5 clients I wanted most." Remember, he has no clients at this time, none, and this is the list. "General Foods, Bristol-Myers, Campbell Soup Company, Lever Brothers and Shell, the oil company." He says to pick such blue-chip targets was an act of mad presumption, but all five of them are now clients of Ogilvy & Mather.

That's banana here. I love this idea because I know myself as why there's always, always, always opportunity for new businesses. The reason that you have new, tiny companies that can either create something brand new or take customers away from a larger, more established player has to do with the nature of humans. And he says, "To new agency is about to embark on the pursuit of their first clients." So he's using the word agencies, but this applies to any company, "I bequeath a set-piece, which worked magic in my early days. Once every few years, a new -- a great new agency is born." And so he talks about the traits, "it is ambitious, hard-working, full of dynamite. It gets accounts from soft, old agencies. It does great work. The years past, the founders get rich and tired. Their creative fires go out. They become extinct volcanos," or you could argue that their attention is elsewhere. "The agency may continue to prosper, its original momentum is not yet spent. It has powerful contacts, but it has grown too big. It produces dull routine campaigns based on the echo of old victories. Dry rot sets in. At this stage, it begins losing accounts to vital new agencies, ruthless upstarts who work hard and pull all their dynamite into their advertisements. We can all name famous agencies, which are more bonded. You hear demoralizing whispers in their corridor as long before the truth downs on their clients. So that's something that's played out." He's writing these words in 1962, and that still could be as true to a most likely going to remain constant for as long as we're building companies. I love this idea. And somebody I'm a huge -- obviously, I've studied a lot of Henry Ford. I've got, I don't know, 3 or 4 podcasts on them. I'm going to wind up doing more podcasts in the future because he's just -- he's one of the most influential entrepreneurs of ever. There are so many people that came after, and they learned from him. David Ogilvy is the same person. He gets his first client by following Henry Ford's idea. He said, "Following Henry Ford's advice to his dealers," meaning the people who want to sell Ford automobiles. "Following Henry's advised to his dealers that they should solicit by personal visitation," meaning they should come to Detroit and asked to be a dealer, "I started by soliciting advertisers who did not employ an agency at all." So he just starts dropping in on potential client's office.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He just stops by, starts doing a pitch and he winds up being -- he gets a first -- he gets his first client, and they spend about $40,000 with him in the first year. And the chapter I mean is called, 'How to Get Clients.' I would -- I mean, if you have -- I think this book is like 12 books in Amazon right now. If you have 12 books laying around, I would definitely buy it and read this chapter because it's essentially a chapter on how to get customers, which every business obviously needs to learn and to understand how to do. And he's just got some freaking really good ideas, like the next page. I'm not going to read all of them, obviously. I think this is genius. He's talking about all the weird things he had to do because he's like, listen, look, we have no money. This is a new -- this is like we don't have any money, and we have no clients like we have to do -- like we have to outsmart our competition because we can't outspend them, right? So he does this thing where he -- and he's always intentional just like when he first -- the first day of his advertising agency, he writes up to five like aspirational clients he has. So then he identifies a bunch of other people that he want to advertise, and he starts just -- again, he has a background in research. So he just goes and looks for useful information and just start sending to them unsolicited. He's got this huge direct mail campaign going. So he says, "I sent frequent progress reports to 600 people in every walk of life. This barrage of direct mail was read by the most august of advertisers. For example, when I solicited part of the Seagram account, Samuel Bronfman, the Founder of Seagram, played back to me the last two paragraphs of a 16-page speech I had sent him shortly before, and then he hired us." So like why is that important? Because the first time Sam Bronfman, who is at this time, most likely a billionaire, I actually did a podcast on him. It's on the reviewer-only feedstuff, but anyways, the first time Sam Bronfman ever hears of David Ogilvy, it's because David randomly, unsolicited sent him 16 pages of information that is -- that he might find useful for his business. Who is going -- if you're going around just providing value and not expecting anything in return, like that's a good way -- like being nice to strangers and providing the value is a good way to get leads coming back to you. And we see this with the result is he gets hired by a massively successful company. He says, "Gentle reader, if you are shocked by these confessions of self-advertisement, I can only plea that if I had behaved in a more professional way, it would have taken me 20 years to arrive." This is maybe one of my favorite sentences in the entire book, "I had neither the time nor the money to wait. I was poor, unknown, and in a hurry."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It's also like he's not just being a -- he's not sending them may be different if he just mail, like you see these examples pop over the line, sometimes where people want something from you. So they e-mail you over and over and over again, like, "oh, you haven't responded to my fourth email. So I'm obviously need send this again." This is like you're asking me for something. Like that's a completely different way to introduce yourself to me than if you just said, "Hey, I have a lot of value for you. Here you go." Like that will probably spawn a discussion. Maybe it leads to an opportunity for your company, maybe it doesn't, but that's a lot better than that just saying, "Hey, give me, give me, give me, give me something. Like that's the normal human tendency. It is like what can you do for me to flip that. David Ogilvy reverses like, this is what I can do for you, "Hey, I have this information, you might find it interesting. And he was right. Sam founded it is so interesting, he hired him. So a few pages later. I like this idea, I like this contrast because he's extremely serious about being very skilled at his craft, skilled advertising, but he also wants to have fun in life. And you can read these pages and tell like he was -- he's got a very playful side to him. So he tells you like, well, let me just read it, "Handling the accounts once you've got them is deadly serious business. You were spending other people's money and the fate of their company often rests in your hands. But I regard," so he is saying take it seriously, like, this is people's livelihood at stake, you have to do a good job. "But I regard the hunt for new clients as a sport. If you play it grimly, you will die of ulcers. If you play with lighthearted Gusto, you will survive your failures without losing sleep. Play to win, but enjoy the fun." He's got more advice for us, "Have a point of view. Not everyone will like it, and that's fine. That's normal. I have never wanted to get an account so big that I could not afford to lose it. The day you do that, you commit yourself to living with fear. Frightened agencies lose the courage to give candid advice. Once you lose that, you become a lacky." So if you're candid with people, some people are going to like what you had to say and they're going to be more drawn to you. Some people are going to hate it and they're going to repel to you, That's life acting as it normally should. This is why it's so important to set high standards for yourself.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This is something he talks about a lot. "If you set high standards in one department, you are likely to set high standards in every department." This one could be -- this advice could just be embracer humanness. You're imperfections, that's what makes you humans. So he says, "I always tell prospective clients about the chinks in our armor. I have noticed that when an anti-dealer draws my attention to flaws in a piece of furniture, he wins my confidence." And I think understanding Ogilvy's personality and like where does the self-confidence come from? It doesn't come from like a place of -- like it's not like, oh, I'm great because I say I'm great. He has confidence because he's put in the work. His advantage is he has done the work others couldn't do or unwilling to do. So he says, "In my heart, I know that my years with Dr. Gallup at Princeton gave me more insight into the habits and mentality of the American consumer than most native copywriters can bring to bear. And I always hope that this will become apparent as my presentation unfolds." And this is him on why we should study advertising. So he's talking about this person was trying to hire, they're spending a lot of money on advertising, but not really -- they didn't really understand it. So he says, "He was not aware that $1 million worth of effective advertising can sell more than $10 million worth of ineffective advertising." Mail-order advertisers, this is some class of advertisers that Ogilvy holds in high regard, and he basically studies them and then applies their techniques to advertising for companies like Shell and things that are not mail order, not like direct response. So he says, "Mail-order advertisers have found that a mere change of a headline can increase sales 10x. And I've seen a television commercial sell 5x as much for a product as other commercials written by the same person. I know of a brewer," of beer essentially, "who sells more of his beer to the people who've never seen his advertising than the people who see it every week. Bad advertising can un-sell a product." So he want to study advertising because you are not only spending money and time on something, that's actually counter to your goal, which is essentially to sell more of your product. So this is interesting. Shall I read it first? Yes. Let me read this first. "It has become increasingly difficult for agencies to make any profit at all. On every $100 spent by agencies on behalf of their clients, they now make an average profit of $0.34.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

At this rate, the game is hardly worth the candle." Never heard that phrase before. "Experience has taught me that advertisers get the best results when they pay their agency a flat fee. The conventional 15% commission system is an anachronism." The agency is expected to give -- so let me give you some -- he actually got into trouble with like the American Association of Advertising because it's like they set up this fee system where it's just like, okay, you're going to pay your agency 15% commission on the advertising they buy for you, and that's basically how they're going to -- like how they're going to make their money. But if you factor in all your expenses, like that's what he's saying, like my profit is $0.34 on every $100, like that's terrible. So he says, and he's describing like why he's one of the first people to speak out about this. And essentially, what he's really talking about here is incentives. And I think that's the important part. So he says, "The agency is expected to give objective advice on the division of marketing expenditures between commissionable advertising and uncommission able promotions," meaning the advertising, sometimes when they buy -- when advertising agencies buy from a specific, let's say, publication, they get a kickback. That's what he means by commissionable advertising. Well, what are humans going to do? They're going to guide you to the publication that's paying them and not the one that's not. So he says, "It's unrealistic to expect your agency to be impartial when its vested interest lies wholly in the direction of increasing your commissionable advertising, meaning the advertising that you have Capex on. I prefer to be in a position to advise my clients to spend more time -- to spend more without they suspecting my motive.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I like to be in a position to advise clients to spend less without incurring the odium of my own stockholders." So the note of myself was he's really talking about incentives here. And this is something that Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger talk about constantly, align your incentives completely with your customers, your employees and your shareholders, and yourself. And one of the craziest things I learned when I was reading Buffett shareholders -- shareholder letters was that Warren put -- he had 99% of his net worth in this company. His incentives were aligned. So he's not going to be saying, "Hey, buy my stock. And if it goes up, like you're going to benefit. But if it goes down, I still -- like I already have your money, like, no. He's like, you're not going to criticize -- he's like, I want my -- our incentives are aligned. You know I'm damn sure if 99% of my net worth is based on the decisions I make for the financial performance of this company, I'm going to be paying attention. I have skin in the game. Compare that to most CEOs of large corporations, they have a tiny, tiny percent of ownership. And usually, their competition is organized in like a very short-term, like quarter-to-quarter basis. Warren's got 99% of his family's assets in the ability to do his job correctly. And again, I think that understanding and studying incentives is just extremely important, not only for humans, in general. It also gives you an idea of why people do what they do. And I love their messages of like you really need to study the incentives. Like is your incentive aligned with your customer? Because Ogilvy will be saying, hey, with this 15% commission system, our incentives are not aligned with our customer. Like why don't we align our incentives with our customer. Like let's make sure that when they win, we win, and then when they lose, we lose as well. So okay, this idea -- another note, this idea can be applied generally, clear communication inside and outside of your company plus set high standards, most people won't. Most people don't rather. Why go to work at all? Okay, let me read. I'm jumping ahead of myself. So he says -- this is one idea that I was just saying can apply to everything, the value of clear communication.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he's giving us in this section, Ogilvy just giving advice on -- well, he said the subheading of the section is, "Be candid and encourage candor. If you think that your agency is performing badly or if you think that a particular advertisement is feeble," he's talking about how you could be a good client, "don't beat about the bush." This is what he wants from clients. "Speak your mind loud and clear. Disastrous consequences can arise when a client pussy foots in his day-to-day dealings with his agency. I do not suggest that you should threaten, don't say you're an incompetent," I don't know what this word is, "muck." "And I will get another agency unless you come back tomorrow with a great advertisement. It is better to say what you've just shown me is not up to your usual high standard. Please take another crack at it. At the same time, you should explain exactly what you find inadequate about the submission, don't leave your agency to guess," another word of advice he has here, "set high standards, discourage bunting, make it plain that you expect your agency to hit home runs and pour on the praise when they do." And then this is the thing I love because I always think about Nolan Bushnell, who's the founder of Atari and Chuck E. Cheese. He also was Steve Jobs' boss when he was young. Steve Jobs worked at Atari. And Nolan wrote this book that I did podcast on, it's called, I think, How to Find the Next Steve Jobs, something like that. It's like there's a book of aphorisms on what he's learned from 5 decades of running companies and Nolan is a hell of a character in general, like he is a crazy, crazy, crazy dude. And he had this thing where he's like Steve Jobs had one speed, go. And so Nolan says like, when I gave young Steve Jobs a directive or I needed something done, I just had to tell him, and I just never -- like I knew that's it. I told him what to do. I told him what I need it done rather not what to do because Steve would come up with his own ways to do things. But he's like, I could tell him what I needed done, and I just knew he got on it and like he didn't stop until it was done. And so I love this idea where what David is saying here very -- it's a similar idea where it's like, listen, time is important, like how fast you can do think is extremely important. So he says, "Hurry," that's the heading. He says, "Most big corporations behave as if profit were not a function of time." And he gives an example of the guy that invented Listerine. "When Jerry Lambert scored his first breakthrough Listerine, he speeded up the whole process of marketing by dividing time into months. Instead of locking himself into annual plans, Lambert reviewed his advertising and his profits every month. The result was that he made $25 million in 8 years, where it takes most people 12 times as long. In Jerry Lambert's day, the Lambert Pharmaceutical Company lived by the month instead of by the year. I commend that course to all advertisers." And finally, another piece of advice, "Tolerate genius. Conan Doyle wrote that 'Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself.' My observation has been that mediocre men recognized genius resented and feel compelled to destroy it. There are very few men of genius in advertising agencies, but we need all the ones we can find." Almost with -- this is a very interesting and also something I find probably true based on reading all these biographies, "almost without exception, they are disagreeable. Don't destroy them.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

They lay golden eggs." What I love about Ogilvy too is he knows the true purpose of his product. So he goes there and at this point of the book, he's talking about like people -- there's different schools of thought about like what is a good advertisement, and some people are saying, it's the one that wins awards. It's the one that's creative. And he rejects that because he knows the true purpose of his product. He says, "I belong to the third school, which holds that a good advertisement is one in which sells the product without drawing attention to itself. It should rivet the readers' attention on the product instead of saying, 'What a clever advertisement,' the reader says, 'I never knew that before. I must try this product.' It is the professional duty of the advertising agent to conceal his artifice. When Aeschines spoke, they said, 'How well he speaks.' But when Demosthenes spoke, they said, 'Let's march against Philip.' I am for Demosthenes," and I'm probably pronouncing it incorrectly, sorry. "If my new recruits boggle at the stern definition of good advertising, I invite them to return to their previous incarnations there to flounder in silliness and ignorance." I invite them to flounder in silliness and ignorance, that's hilarious. All right. So this is what I said was really genius of something he did. He learns lessons from one industry so he can apply it to his own. He says, "From the experience of mail, first, I study," he's talking about like where he learned from, "First, I study from the experience of mail-order advertisers. This is the elite core of advertising. They know more about the realities," he italicized that word of advertising than anybody else. "They are in a position to measure the results of every advertisement they write because their view is not obscured by those complex channels of distribution, which make it impossible for most manufacturers to dissect out the results of their advertising from all other factors," So they know. He says, "The mail-order advertiser must rely on his advertisements to do the entire selling job. A few days after his advertisement appears, the mail-order writer knows whether it's profitable or not." So since they are one of the few forms of advertising at the time he's writing this, he's able to actually measure performance, he studies their principles and then applies them to non-direct mail or direct response advertising, which is most of what Ogilvy does. Now he's just going to tell us a little bit about its personality. "I am an inveterate brain-picker, and the most rewarding brains I have picked are the brains of my predecessors," in other words, he's learning from people that came before him, "and my competitors. I have learned much from studying their successful campaigns."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

In fact, the last chapter, if I remember correctly, Ogilvy on Advertising, he analyzes the six, like, godfathers of advertising agencies that came before him, and he talks explicitly about which ideas he took and what he learned from them, which is really interesting. Skipping ahead, this is something that may be a little counterintuitive. He says over and over again, 'longer advertising sells more product than short advertising.' So he's like, you need to give your customers more information. "When I was a door-to-door salesman, I discovered that the more information I gave about my product, the more I sold." "Claude Hopkins," who is one of the most famous copywriters, "made the same discovery about advertising 50 years ago, but most modern copywriters find it easier to write short, lazy advertisements. Collecting facts is hard work." So it's one of the benefits that he has over his competition is that he studied the history of the industry he is in and therefore, knows that a lot of the counterintuitive ideas can only be gained through experience. So you might as well study the experience, and he said Claude Hopkins extensively. This is him repeating himself, "Keep the ad the same until it stops working. If you're lucky enough to write a good advertisement, repeat it until it stops pulling, scores of good advertisements have been discarded before they lost their potency." And this is something that's really hard to understand because your ads go out, and you don't know -- like you can maybe assume that the same people are saying the same stuff over and over, he says that's not true. "You aren't advertising to a standing army. You're advertising to a moving parade. 3 million consumers get married every year.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The advertisement which sold a refrigerator to those who got married last year were probably just as successful with those who get married next year." And this is just random, but he quotes this poem from Kipling that I really like and it talks about there's just -- if you come up with original thoughts if you said your craft, like you're going to have your creativity and originality and leaning more into what makes you unique as a person, it can't be copied. Even if your competitors copy every single thing your business does, they're always going to be behind. So he has -- it's a poem by Kipling about a self-made shipping tycoon, this guy's name is Sir Anthony Gloster. And on his deathbed, the old man reviews the course of his life for the benefit of his son, and he refers contemptuously to his competitors. So he says, "They copied all they could follow, but they couldn't copy my mind, and I left them sweating and stealing 1.5 years behind." I want to quote from this chapter, it says -- this is a fantastic chapter. It says, "How to rise to the top of the tree, advice to the young." So he says, "After watching the careermanship of my own employees for 14 years, I have identified a pattern of behavior, which leads rapidly to the top." He says, "First, you must be ambitious," but he also says, "Don't be nakedly ambitious." Like you've got to kind of hide that a little bit. But he's says, "after -- once you realize that you're ambitious, like go, set yourself." He goes, "Set yourself to become the best-informed man in the agency on the account to which you are assigned." Now he's giving explicit advice for people working advertising. This applies to everything else in life, though, "Set yourself to becoming the best-informed person on the account in which you're assigned," meaning what you're doing for work or what you're interested in. "If, for example, it is a gasoline account, read textbooks on the chemistry, geology, and distribution of petroleum products. Read all the trade journals in the field. Read all the research reports and marketing plans that your agency has ever written on the product. Spend Saturday mornings in service stations, pumping gasoline and talking to motorists. Visit your client’s refineries and research laboratories. Study the advertising of its competitors. At the end of your second year, you will know more about gasoline than your boss, and you will then be ready to succeed him."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And why is this important? Most people in agencies are too lazy to do this kind of homework. They remain permanently superficial. So it's important for him to say like -- in different ways he is telling us, go as deep as possible, learn as much as you can, deep, deep, deep. And we're going to talk about it more on that. But when I read this section, I thought of one of my favorite talks that I've ever heard. And I have just notes -- I just put all my notes in this database. But I have notes on that, let's say, 200, I don't know, 25 -- 250 different talks and there's some more on like a Google Doc that I got to combine. But let's say, 250 for the sake of argument of notes from entrepreneurs and founders talking about entrepreneurship, right? And out of all those, one of my favorite talks ever heard was this talk by Bill Gurley. It's called Running Down a Dream, How to Succeed and Thrive in a Career You Love. It's on YouTube, you can watch it for free. It's like less than an hour long and he's giving a talk to, I think, like, let's say, like University of Texas MBA students or something like that. And he's been widely successful. I think he's like undoubtedly wildly successful. And so now he's going back to the school and giving advice that he wish he knew when he was younger, which I think is some of the most valuable advice, you can find, right? But there's a quote in this fantastic talk. And it reminds me, like Bill Gurley has given the talk maybe the last few years, it's echoing what David Ogilvy's writing to us in the 1960s. And this is a quote from Bill Gurley, "You have zero excuse for not being the most knowledgeable person in any subject you want.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The information is right there at your fingertips," right? So the beginning of that quote he says, the good news is if you're going to research something, this is your lucky day, information is freely available on the Internet. The bad news, you have zero excuse for not being the most knowledgeable person in any subject you want, information is right there at your fingertips. Think about what he's saying, how ridiculously easy it is to get an advantage, right? The information is there. You can pull it up. You can watch YouTube videos. You can read trade reports. You can buy books. You can go and learn anything, and nobody can stop you. Like what he's saying here, the description of reading books on geology, chemistry, visiting this plant. This is probably a few months, but most people won't do this. So the reason I say this is like so ridiculously easy of an advantage to do is like you know it's a ridiculously easy advantage to have because the information is right there. You can access it anywhere you are in the world and yet nobody does, or such a tiny percentage of people do. And I'm going to give you an example from somebody that does that actually followed the advice that Ogilvy is giving us here. So he says, several years ago, Lever Brothers. So Lever Brothers is a giant company at the time. He has a bunch of different advertising agencies. I didn't -- something I also learned is businesses have multiple newly large companies have multiple different advertising agencies. So it says several years ago, Lever Brothers asked their seven agencies to submit policy papers on the television medium, which was then quite new. The other agencies put in adequate papers of 5 or 6 -- adequate papers of 5 or 6 pages, but a young man on my staff took the trouble to assemble every conceivable statistic. And after working day and night for 3 weeks, came up with an analysis which covered 177 pages. His lazy colleague smeared at him as a compulsive worker. But 1 year later, he was elected to our Board of Directors. On such isolated incidents are most successful careers built.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Think about that. The reason I say this is such a ridiculous is not like you have to be born with like unique skill. You just literally have to read and learn more than other people and just doing that -- he did this in 3 weeks. Like just doing that gave him such an advantage to a point where like he -- the speed at which -- so maybe he invested -- let's say the other people, they took maybe, what, a couple of days to write to 5 or 6 pages, maybe they did 2 days of research. So he did, let's say, 21 days of research, so 10x, but you also accelerated his career, what, 10, 20, maybe 50x faster than they did. Maybe they never even get past with just doing the bare minimum. Maybe they never advance in their career. So maybe they don't even advance at all. So that's why I say, it's just like I love that quote by Bill Gurley. He is like "Good news is you can learn anything you want. The bad news is you have no excuse not to." The thing is the advantage here that's really important is that most people are never going to hold themselves to that standard, right? And by doing this, you're making yourself unreplaceable. So he says, "Nowadays, it is a fashion to pretend that no single individual is ever responsible for a successful advertising campaign. This emphasis on teamwork is bunk, a conspiracy" -- listen to what he describes this out, "the emphasis on teamwork is bunk, a conspiracy of the mediocre majority. No advertisement, no commercial, and no image can be created by a committee. Most top managements are secretly aware of this, and they keep their eyes open for those rare individuals who lay golden eggs." So there's that term again. So what is the result of being like this? It's -- when you're such a formidable person, using that word he used again, you become immune to the threat of dismissal in times of scarcity. So if you were the single best person at your job, but there's nobody else that does it, whether you're running a company or you're working for somebody else, you're -- like if you become -- you're irreplaceable, which means even in a downturn, they can't get rid of you, unless the company is going, obviously, out of business. I just like that immune to the threat of dismissal in times of scarcity. And you're doing that just by differentiating yourself because you realize that most people are at -- like they're not going to do that work. I was just listening to -- let me pull up the note really quick. I was just listening to this guy named Josh Wolfe, who's got -- he's an investor, but he's like, grew up poor. He was raised in Coney Island. His dad skipped out, didn't -- like left him and his mom. His mom had to be a single mother. I think she had to work like two jobs or whatever.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And Josh is like a wickedly smart person. And I've taken a lot of notes on whenever he appears on podcasts, I give talks just because he's got a weird, unique mind. And he thinks about things very, very differently than other people. And I think like just by listening to him speak, there's going to be a lot that I can actually learn. So he was giving this talk and I just -- I have my notes in front of me, and I want to read them to you really quick because I've heard this idea expressed other ways, right? People use the idea of like, oh, like -- let me just read what he says first. So he talks about like the things that his company tries to invest in, and the entrepreneurs that he tries to partner with -- he doesn't -- like he has no interest in doing just normal apps or just other stuff like that. He's like, I don't feel I have an advantage there. He says, "What we look for." He's like, "We want really high scientific and technical complexity." And this is the main point, why would you do that? "Not because we want to tackle things that are really hard. It's because we don't want competition." This is counterintuitive point. It's because we don't want competition. "The problem with funding and doing easy things is you get hundreds of competitors. I'm psychotic about competitive advantage." So I apply this like -- I've heard this term where it talks about like a lot of people -- like if you're doing something truly unique and truly, really hard, it means like it's still going to be really hard, but it's probably easier than other people think because you can attract talent and resources to the one thing you're doing. So let me give you an example. I'm not being clear. Elon Musk wanted to start a private space company, and he did in SpaceX, right? When he started, it was ridiculous. Like people -- when you shot something in the space, it was like the domain of governments, right, like who the hell has their own private rocket company. This is insane. But -- so yes, it's obviously really hard. He almost failed at it many times if you know the history of SpaceX. But the point he was making is like, well, but I can attract the best talent.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Let's say you were obsessed with rocket science and space from an early age and you dedicate life to that. How many jobs could you actually like be fulfilling? Means, I will get the -- people who have been obsessed with this their whole lives because nobody else is doing this. This is the same thing that Josh is saying here. We want a really high barrier to scientific and technical complexity, not because we want to just make our lives hard, although I do personally think like inducing artificial -- like making your life harder than it needs to be is beneficial to you, like don't take elevator, walk up the stairs, like just sort of a million other ways you can make your life harder, and you actually -- you benefit from that. But this idea of like you have less competition. Ogilvy is telling us the same thing here that, first of all, you should be doing -- he has less research because not many people are going to spend years as a researcher, right, working under Gallup and Princeton. This -- the guy that was working for Ogilvy that he just gave us the story from. Like, he has less competition to become -- in his case, he got promoted to the Board of Directors because most people are writing 5-page reports. Given that the same opportunity, he's like, no, I'm going to take the harder route. I'm going to do 167 pages. And as a result, he distinguished himself. He's not doing that because he wants to make his job harder. He's doing that because he doesn't want competition, and he didn't have competition because now you're like, "Oh, who we're going to promote, not these other five people didn't do anything. Like this guy clearly, he did 25x amount of the work given the same prompt." And I think this idea is extremely important and counterintuitive like you want to do hard things because if it was easier, everybody would do it.

Number three, "Get rid of sad dogs who spread doom. Number four, "In the best establishments, promises are always kept, whatever it may cost in agony and overtime." Five, "Tell the truth, but make the truth fascinating." Six, "We prefer the discipline of knowledge to the anarchy of ignorance." And lastly, "I admire people with gentle manners who treat other people as human beings." All right. That's where I leave the story. See, I really think you have to -- if you want to buy the book, I'll leave a link in the show notes, it's Amazon affiliate link, which means if you buy it, a small percentage -- Amazon sends me a small percentage of sale, no additional cost to you. So it's a way for you to support the author, support yourself by getting a great book and support the podcast at the same time. So what I would say is like the reason I think especially you have to buy Confessions of an Advertising Man and then also buy Ogilvy on Advertising. It's because a lot of these are explicit, like this is what I learned from my experience, do this. And if you don't read the whole book, you're going to miss out on some of those. So obviously, I just presented this book with based on like stuff I want to learn. These are my personal notes, stuff I want to remember and keep. But you may read the book. And undoubtedly, you'll have different takeaways. So -- as you just saw, I just presented this entire podcast without ads, which means I rely on the people that give value of my work to sustain the work that I'm doing here. So the way I do that, remember, we set the incentives. If I just put out every single podcast for free and said, please support voluntarily on a monthly basis or on an annual basis, a lot less people would do that, right? Which I've run these experiments -- if you listened these podcasts one more time, I've run these experiments over time and definitely -- and see that result. So what I do is what I think is extremely fair is, "Hey, I put a lot of damn work into this, like there's hours and hours and hours of preparation I had to do before I sit down to record. Obviously, I have to read the entire new book every week. So what I think is fair is I'm going to give away half of my podcast for free, which is what I do. I think it's like every odd number, it's free; every even number, I charge. It's called the misfit fee in case you don't know what that is. It's the same thing. I feel like the free podcasters, like the free trial version if you think of this podcast as a product, right? So if you learn and you like the free podcast, you'll like the misfits. It's the same thing. Now how do you get access to the misfit feed. It's not difficult.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

In your podcast player, if you're listening, most podcast players make all the links in the show notes clickable. You just pull it up, press hey, I think it says like become a misfit, unlock all the premium episodes. You tap that, within 10 to 30 seconds, you can sign up, support the podcast on a monthly or annual basis. And the private RSS feed, which is what a podcast is, is automatically installed in your podcast player of choice. So within -- from 10 to 30 seconds by the time you tap on that link, you can then unlock all of them. And I forgot how many I have so far, a lot. And in addition to unlocking my back catalog, right, I do two extra podcasts only for misfit every month. So you have -- now you unlock, you can go through, I don't know, dozens of hours. I don't know how long it is, but at this point of my back catalog, but you'll also get two every month. Now the people that sign up for the misfit feed, essentially, you're getting two extra ones, but you're also paying for my ability to make the two free ones every month. So if people didn't sign up misfit feed, obviously wouldn't be able to do that. So if you're kind of person like, "Hey, I find a lot of value at your work, David, for a few bucks a month, I'm willing to make sure that you don't stop quit doing this because I want you to go search through history of entrepreneurship and find me ideas that I can use in my life. And I'll say, cool, I'll keep doing that. Now I'm going to say something else, and so -- another thing, anything else, like if it's too confusing to do on your podcast player, go to Founderspodcast.com browser on your cell phone. And you'll see, it'll say like support Founders or support this podcast and unlock all the premium episodes. It's in the header, too. So some people get confused because podcast players show links in different ways, but the browser is going to look -- work like any browser does. So Founderspodcast.com, and you can do the same exact thing. And everything that I do is on Founderspodcast.com, like all the list of books and everything else. Now here's something else I never talk about, but is really valuable. And for some reason, people are still finding it even though I'm talking about and are still signing up for it. So I -- like I just mentioned earlier, I have taken notes on lectures, podcast, talks on entrepreneurship for years, years. I had the same way like what you just heard me do is I read books, I take notes and highlights, and then I keep all this stuff because I like to go back. And like even if I never read Confessions of an Advertising Man before -- again, right? I can go back 6 months from now and just read my highlights I'm like, wow, like I remember all this stuff. So I do the same thing for talks, right? And I did this for a little bit.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I have the thing called David's notes, right? And what I'm essentially doing now, it's another -- I have another private podcast. I don't even talk about too much. And essentially, what I've done is when I take notes on a podcast, let's say I take notes and there's an hour-long talk. I might have notes that'll take me, if I read them to you, 5 or 10 minutes. And these are the main ideas and the stuff I want to remember, right? Well, I turn them into a podcast. And I'm going to start leaving -- unless we're talking about it in case because there's people -- it's very -- it's just weird because I did this for a little bit and I was like man, this is a lot of work because I do, on average, about three of these mini podcasts a week on different talks that I've heard, right? And what we -- I was like, this is too much work. It's taking away from my focus on the main Founders episodes. So I did it for a little bit. People found it. They started signing up and paying for it. And then I stopped doing it and people got mad. They're like -- not they weren't like -- I don't mean that like a -- they weren't like angry at me. They're like damn, don't -- I'm sad that you stopped because I liked it so much. And so after like 2 months, I realize, "Oh, you know what, it wasn't that I was distracting from Founders podcast." When I take notes on all these talks and I read them constantly, that actually adds to other stuff I talked to you about on the main Founders episode, right? Because as I just referenced, I don't know, 2 or 3 times in this podcast, ideas I got from taking notes on lectures from podcast I may have done 6 months ago or a year ago that I can then use -- that I can then continue to use in conversation and podcast in life.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I started back up like a few months ago, and people kept -- they started signing up again, even I don't talk about it. It sounds like maybe David, like these people -- and then I get e-mails, people respond back to the e-mail. And they're like, I learn a lot from this. I'm like, oh, this is interesting. So anyway, I'm going to leave a link in there, if you want to sign up. I've done -- I was shocked when I counted the archive the other day. I've done 53 of these podcasts, these like miniature podcasts, anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes long. So if you want to unlock that, now I need to be -- the reason I don't talk about this because I don't like James Dyson says, don't like confuse people with multiple messages. So I'm violating his principle because listen, my main goal is for you to sign up for the misfit feed, right? But I do know that there's people that are willing that want to go deeper on this subject of entrepreneurship because entrepreneurship seems to attract extreme personalities. And extreme personalities seem to like more information. They don't want to limit their learning. So what I would say is first sign up for the misfit feed because that way I can keep doing Founders podcast. And I think I do -- they're 1 hour, 1.5 hours, whatever they are. And you'll learn in 4 to 5, 6 hours a month, like you learn a lot about the history of entrepreneurship, right? And then if you want to go deeper, sign up for David's Notes. And David's Note is completely separate. This is just literally the notes I take. Instead of you reading notes, I read them to you and I had additional commentary, which is exactly the same process I do in the books, but this is on lectures. So let me just go through some of the ones I've done, like I did Charlie Munger just gave this talk. And Charlie Munger's advice on investing in life choices that make a personal wealth. It's 45 minutes of a 95-year-old genius talk. I took notes on that. Marc Andreessen talking about how he's famous for studying history. So you get his talk on keys from like the Internet past to the future of crypto. John Carmack on time management, discipline, limits, and resilience. Steve Jobs plan to turn around Apple. So I did podcast -- those on podcast, but what I've been doing more lately scouring the Internet and essentially YouTube for talks like in the past because podcast, they're presented in like a reverse chronological order.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So people we seem to like favor like the new and podcast. But like I think there's more knowledge about starting and running companies from dead people than there are about people live for sure, I believe that. So I found this talk were Steve Jobs. It's in like 1987, like a few weeks after, he comes back to Apple. Before the iPod, before the iPhone or anything. And he lays out his plan exactly who's going to turn around Apple. And he does it. And the principles that he lays out in that are the exact same principles that can be applied today. I did Elon Musk commencement address; it's called the Magicians of the 21st Century. There was a lot of information in there. How Jeff Bezos makes decisions, Jimmy Ivine talking about founding Interscope Records and Selling Beats by Dre. So you see what I mean. It's like there's a variety of things that I cover. And I just -- I think I might have been making a mistake by not trying to confuse you, but I should probably tell you the stuff I'm working on and not just like have to make you jump through hoops to find those things. So from now on, I'll put the links in the show notes, and I think I'll just -- I'll find a way to add like another header in Founderspodcast.com, but you might want to hear this. And if you want to hear then obviously, you can sign up and that will benefit you and obviously benefit me as well. Okay. So I think I've talked enough. One thing I do want to say, I want to tell you the books I'm going to be doing. So if you haven't signed up for the Misfit Feed, please do. I really think the podcast I did, the 3-hour long podcast on Warren Buffett shareholder letters, it was by far the hardest podcast that I ever had to do by far. I mean it is insane like it's funny because I start reading these shareholder letters.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

1965 Berkshire Hathaway is just a textile company, then he expands into insurance. So I'm reading to the shareholders like, wow, look at the progress in making. Now realizing that as the business gets more complex, the shareholder letters get longer. So I could see the finish line, and then I felt like it was going further and further away from it because they get long. I think I don't know how long each one was. The only time he referenced, and he said like he wrote -- he's like last year, shareholder was like 12,000 words or whatever. So anyways, the reason I bring this up is because I think if you can just listen to that. It would pay for years of the subscription fees for description prices for the Misfit Feed. Now I'm going to -- the reason I bring that up to too is because last week, I did the Berkshire, right? This week, I did a book that I learned about from the Berkshire letters. For the next 2 weeks, I'm going to stay on this topic. Next week, which, oh, my god help me, I'm going to be doing Poor Charlie's Almanack, one of the most recommended books by entrepreneurs who are live today that I've ever seen. I mean, literally, everybody says over and over again read this book. It is massive. It's not like 54 years of Berkshire Hathaway letters, but it's up there. It's going to save me a long time. Hopefully, I can finish that by next week. And the week after that, I'm going to read a book by somebody you've never heard of. This guy name is Jim Clayton, most likely you never heard of. I didn't know who Jim Clayton was, but I'm reading Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder letters and the students came to visit Warren Buffett. They gave him a book. They gave him a gift. The gift was Jim Clayton's autobiography, which is how Jim Clayton is talking about like how he built his company. Warren Buffett like the book a much, he bought Jim Clayton's company. And so when I read that, I'm like, I don't know who Jim Clayton is, but I know Warren Buffett admires him so much that he liked the book that he bought a company. That is a clear indication to us that we should be listening -- like we could learn a lot from that book.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So let's go ahead and do that. So that's the basic plan. After that, I can deviate and go back and pick whatever book I want, but that feel like there'd be like basically 4 weeks straight of things that are heavily influenced by Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger, which, again, I've learned so much from. And speaking of that -- the notes I was talking about a minute ago, David's Notes, there's a lot of talks that I think notes on by Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett. I mean YouTube is a treasure trough for them. So I'm losing my voice. I've talked enough. Thank you very much for listening to the podcast. Thank you very much. If you can please tell your friends. I'd really appreciate it. And I will be back next weekend -- or next week, hopefully talking about the wit and wisdom of Charlie Munger.

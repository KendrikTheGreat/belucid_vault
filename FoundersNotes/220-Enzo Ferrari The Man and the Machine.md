And so on this podcast so far, I've mentioned, I don't know, two or three times that Enzo Ferrari is going to go down in history as the greatest car manufacturer of all time. That is also stated in the movie -- there's a scene from the movie Ford v Ferrari, and I'm going to read the transcript to you right now. And so we're going to have -- the first character is -- it's like Henry Ford II's like right-hand executive. I forgot his name. So for this, I'm going to call him Douche because that's what he is. And then he's talking to Lee Iacocca. And before Lee Iacocca became super famous and well-known -- because he winds up taking over the Chrysler Corporation and kind of like bringing it back from the dead. But before he did that, he worked at Ford. And so this is the scene between Douche and Lee Iacocca from the movie Ford v Ferrari. They're all in a meeting. Henry Ford II is sitting there, and the Douche says, "In the last three years, you and your" -- he's talking to Lee Iacocca. "In the last three years, you and your marketing team have presided over the worst sales slump in history. Why should Mr. Ford listen to you?" This is what Lee Iacocca says, "Because we've been thinking wrong. Ferrari, they have won four out of the five -- last five Le Mans. We need to think like Ferrari." Now we're in the 1960s. This is the time period it's happening. The Douche says, "Ferrari makes fewer cars in a year than we do in a day. We spend more on toilet paper than they do on their entire output. You want us to think like them?" And so Lee's response is perfect. "Enzo Ferrari will go down in history as the greatest car manufacturer of all time. Why? Is it because he built the most cars? No. It's because of what his cars mean: victory. When Ferrari wins a Le Mans, people want some of that victory. What if the Ford badge meant victory and meant it where it counts, with the first group of 17-year-olds in history with money in their pockets?" And so when he says that, Henry Ford II like sits up and starts paying attention.

"It was over. A strangely disappointing anticlimax to a life that had spanned most of the history of motorsports. His health had been in severe decline for months, and the end had been expected. While his mind remained quick to the last, the powerful body had long since crumbled under the sheer weight of years. Editorial writers around the world groped for words to express what Enzo Ferrari had meant. Many tried to describe him as an automotive pioneer, which he was not. Others called him a great racing driver and engineer, which he was not. He was exactly what he had repeatedly said he was: an agitator of men. And he remained true to his credo to the day he died. If there was one essential quality about the man, it was his ironbound tenacity, his fierce devotion to the single cause of winning automobile races with cars bearing his name. From 1930 onward, for nearly 60 years, hardly a day passed when this thought was not foremost in his mind. Win or lose, he unfailingly answered the bell. In that sense, his devotion to his own self-described mission was without precedent, at least within the world of motorsports. For that alone, he towered over his peers. Enzo Ferrari, the last of the great automotive titans, was gone, never to be replaced."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

That was an excerpt about the death of Enzo Ferrari. And it comes from the book that we'll talk about today, which is, Enzo Ferrari: The Man and the Machine, written by Brock Yates. And I wanted to start there because this is the third different -- this is the third podcast that I have done on Enzo Ferrari. The first two, in case you haven't gone back and listened to them, it's Founders #97. It's based on that book, Go Like Hell, which is the story about Ford versus Ferrari. And #98 is the biography. Actually, #98 is the longest biography I've ever read from the podcast if you don't include the book of all Warren Buffett shareholder letters. That biography of Enzo Ferrari is almost 1,000 pages long. That's Enzo Ferrari: Power, Politics and the Making of an Automotive Empire. And the reason I wanted to do another book on Enzo and his -- the reason he's one of my favorite founders and entrepreneurs that I've come across since doing this podcast is because one of the sentences that the author just wrote here, "From 1930 onward, for nearly 60 years, hardly a day passed when this thought was not the foremost in his mind." And that's the thought of "his fierce devotion to the single cause of winning automobile races with cars bearing his name." So anytime I have the opportunity to learn from somebody that did the same thing that was singularly -- singularly, I can't even pronounce that word. I don't know if I'm talking funny, but I just had dental work done, so my jaw is still -- if I do sound funny to you, it's just because my jaw is still swollen. But the reason I think that's so interesting is because it's just very rare for somebody to be completely obsessed with the same thing and work on the same thing for nearly six decades. And I think what Enzo Ferrari understood is the same thing that Charlie Munger has talked about Warren Buffett. It's this trait that a lot of the people -- a lot of the entrepreneurs that we talk about on this podcast know, and it's the fact that knowledge compounds. And if you stay focused on the same thing and keep learning about the same thing for multiple decades, never interrupt the compounding, you're going to have a unique set of knowledge that no one else does. And that's why I think also the author says, “He towered over his peers. He was the last of the great automotive titans. And when he's dead, he was never to be replaced again.” So I want to go to the beginning of the book. I want to introduce you to this guy named Luigi Chinetti. Actually, you know what, before I do that, I've been getting a lot of messages about gift subscriptions especially for this time of the year. I recently just switched to a different provider that has a more complete feature set for subscription podcasting. So there's a link in the show notes that you'll find down below. If you click that link and go to the upper right-hand corner, it'll say, gift a subscription, and then it gives you a very simple set of instructions on how to do that. If you want to, then you can give a monthly subscription or a lifetime subscription. If you're interested in a lifetime subscription, jump on that, though. On January 1, the price is going to go way up.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

For the last few months, I've been running this experiment. It's been very popular, but it's definitely not sustainable. But I do want to give you a few more weeks to take advantage of that. So jump on that if that's interesting. Let me go to Luigi Chinetti. Now the very -- the book opens up. So Ferrari doesn't die until he's 90 years old, and he works until he dies, okay? And the book opens up with Luigi Chinetti who's a few years younger than Ferrari. They were kind of like friends, adversaries, partners in a sense. Luigi Chinetti is the one that introduces the Ferrari, like the cars that you can actually sell, a private consumer could buy, in America. He's the one that opened up the -- which wound up being a gigantic market for Ferrari. And so the book opens up with Chinetti. He's driving from Modena, which is Ferrari's hometown, where he spent most of the time, to Paris. And it plays on the radio that Enzo Ferrari had passed away. So there's -- in the introduction, there's a great overview of Chinetti's view of Ferrari that I think is helpful to us. Let me go into that. And he's thinking back multiple decades that they worked together and really had to fight. "Ferrari, he's one of the people I most admire because of his obsessiveness, his stubbornness, the fact that he identified what was most important to him and he went after with everything he had. But he's not necessarily like somebody I'd want to hang out with, let's put it that way. He's an extremely difficult and cantankerous person and really just rather crude." But we get an idea of that because Chinetti just had these battles with him. So he says, "It had all been an insane aerobatic display of emotion and ego warfare, and he was tired of it all. They had dueled too long. And if a winner had to be declared, it'd have to be Ferrari. But did he not always win? Did he not always prevail? Sometimes coming off the mat after repeated bloody knockdowns to land a knockout punch." And that's another admirable characteristic Ferrari had. He had persistence in spades. "Ferrari shared the spotlight with no one, not even the man who helped create a market for his automobiles larger and more lucrative than anyone could have imagined. He came to know Ferrari too well to understand his" -- the reason I'm reading this section to you is because of this -- I mean I don't want to mince words here.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He's extremely -- the manipulative personality that Enzo Ferrari had. He was -- he described himself as an agitator of men. "He was extremely charismatic, and he could convince people to do whatever he wanted them to do. And that was one of his greatest strengths in his career." He came to know Ferrari too well to understand his chameleon-like public persona, his ability to orchestrate the press and the public to artfully play the lovable, beleaguered, poverty-stricken patriarch one minute and a ruthless egomaniacal despot the next. He had seen the public Ferrari, the regal old don who oozed respectability as well as the private Ferrari: the belching, farting, cursing, bragging, hectoring, Modenese Pisano, who bore his lower-class background like a mark on his forehead.” He, meaning Chinetti, knew Ferrari as the consummate manipulator of men.” He turned on the radio. A newscast was beginning. It was the lead story. In matter-of-fact tones, a voice announced that earlier that morning, death had come to Enzo Ferrari. Ferrari. Dead. It was expected, but somehow it stunned him. This old warrior, this curmudgeon, this masterful manipulator, this tireless competitor, this overwhelming presence, this imperfect but perpetually fascinating man was finally gone." Okay. So now I want to go to Enzo's early life, and then I'm going to build up and tell you how he became Enzo Ferrari because he definitely didn't start out as anything rather like unique. No one would have predicted. If you see Enzo at 20 years old, there's no way you're going to predict that he becomes the greatest car manufacturer of all time. And two quick sentences here that give you an idea of who he was as a kid. "He hated school. He simply wanted to be a worker and nothing else." So his dad, they're living in Italy, of course, where he spent all his life actually. And his Dad is going to take him to an automobile race, and this is where he finds the love of his life, something he's completely obsessed with.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

For Enzo, racing automobiles, racing cars was always the #1 fascination, obsession. He was not really interested -- he just accidentally started manufacturing some of the greatest cars the world's ever seen. But the racing always took precedent over that. His first -- and he sold cars so he could fund his racing operation. His first contact with automobile racing came when his father took him and his brother to a race. He was 10 years old. "The following year, young Ferrari trekked" -- so that's the first race. This is the second one. "The following year, young Ferrari trekked two miles across open farmland to watch his second race. Ferrari said, 'I found these events immensely exciting.'" And so from a very young age, he had identified exactly what he wanted to do. He's eventually going to try to work for car manufacturers and then become a driver -- a racing driver himself. But this might be -- this is the most important paragraph in the entire description of his early life. "Examinations of his youth supply nothing to indicate any extraordinary talents." This really speaks to the benefit of not interrupt -- like the fact that knowledge compounds, and don't interrupt that, right? So "Examinations of his youth supply nothing to indicate any extraordinary talents, no glittering, undiscovered genius, not even the singular talent for leadership and organization that was to blossom later in life. Enzo Ferrari, for his first 20 years, was simply another Italian boy who liked bicycles and car races and football." So when he's 18, something terrible happens. And it says, "In 1916, Enzo Ferrari had his first close encounter with death, an acquaintance that would stay with him for the rest of his life." That's a very important sentence, too, talking about the dozens -- I mean I don't even know how many drivers die at the very beginning of automobile racing. Not only do tons of the drivers die, but tons of the spectators die. So -- and I'll get -- I'll go into more detail. I went into a lot of detail on that on Founders #97, Go Like Hell, which just really surprised me at the beginning of the sport how they just -- they had a high -- extremely high tolerance for death.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so he's 18. "Enzo Ferrari had his first encounter with death, an acquaintance that would stay with him for the rest of his life. His father died of pneumonia. The little business" -- so this little business that his dad had -- "collapsed, and Enzo drifted through a series of menial jobs." As you probably already realize from the year that we're in, 1916, World War II -- or, excuse me, World War I is happening. So he's got to do a bunch of work. "He became a trainee in a small factory, manufacturing artillery shells. This was a confusing time for Ferrari. His father was dead, and with the convulsions of the war plus his lack of serious career goals, he meandered through his late teens without direction. Then suddenly, shockingly, Dino" -- this is his older brother -- "was dead as well." And so this idea that death is an acquaintance that's going to stay with him for the rest of his life. He's 18 years old. His father's dead. His older brother's dead. So all that's left in the family is him and his -- Ferrari and his mom -- Enzo and his mom, rather. Ferrari is eventually going to have a son. He's going to name his son Dino after his brother. His son is going to die. What most people think of, he died from muscular dystrophy in his early 20s. So death is a constant companion throughout the life of -- throughout the extremely long life of Enzo Ferrari. And his brother died because he was in the war. So it says -- and they're not entirely sure. There's just a bunch of -- "could have been influenza, typhoid fever or any one of the dozen illnesses that ravaged the trenches and camps of the World War I combatants." And Dino was serving in that war. Ferrari was devastated by the loss of his Ferrari -- excuse me, of his father and brother. And then right after this, he winds up getting drafted. And so then he's got to serve in the Italian Army towards the end of World War I. So I'm going to skip over most of his time in the war. There is one thing that he talks about over and over again in his autobiography and other people and other documentaries on him that I've seen repeated, is the fact that he winds up getting sick. He gets to a -- he's sent to a hospital. And one of his memories is the fact that he's left in this dark room on the second floor, and all you can hear all day and all night is the hammering of lids of coffins being pounded into place.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And the reason I bring that to your attention is because he's very familiar with death at an extremely early age. So he's like, "Okay, I don't know how long I'm going to survive, how long I'm going to live. I need to get on with my life." So he comes out of his service. Luckily, the war ends the next year, and he survives. And he's just bound and determined to get the job that he wants and to actually live the life that he wants. "He was discharged in 1918 as Europe gasped for breath, and men groped to justify the sacrifice of 30 million lives. Ferrari seems to have been seized with an epiphany of sorts during this period. He wanted to follow a career in automobiles." And in his autobiography, he describes this period as him and his friend get this -- it's like a magazine or some kind of publication. It's amazing how often this -- what I'm about to read to you happens in these biographies. So him and his friend are sitting there looking through this publication. And it says, "They had examined a photograph of Ralph De Palma, the marvelously talented Italian who had moved to America in 1893 and, by 1916, had won both the Indianapolis 500 and the Vanderbilt Cup. He was believed by many to be the greatest driver in the world." So Ferrari turns to his friend and he says, "I will become a race car driver." So he has limited money, no connection. So he goes to -- you can really think about his next move as he's trying to get a job at the leading technology company of its day. And it's funny because this is Fiat, which is, at the time, that company has been way -- I think it's like 120, 125 years old. So today, you don't think of Fiat as a leading technology in the companies today. But in the end of 1920s, it was. So it says, "So he goes to where they're located. He travels." It says, "He had come to Turin with a single purpose in mind: to gain employment with Fiat. Fiat was an acknowledged leader in the new technology." They're talking about the -- this is the very beginning of the automobile industry. And this time in history, I find extremely interesting. Actually, there's a parallel between the early automobile industry in Italy and the early automobile industry in America.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I did a multiple-part series. It's around Founders #118, and I think it goes all the way to like Founders #130. So this is -- I read a ton of biographies on all these -- the early American automobile founders and pioneers. So it's people like Henry Ford; Billy Durant, the founder of General Motors; the Dodge Brothers; Henry Leland, the guy that founded Cadillac; Albert Champion; Alfred Sloan; Walter Chrysler; and Louis Chevrolet. And there's a number of interesting things, one, they are there at the very birth of what is going to become a gigantic industry, global industry, right? And they all knew each other. They're all supporting casts in each other's life stories. And the same thing is going to happen in the early motorsports, this fever for racing that the Italians had. Because as we'll see here, like these are -- the names I'm about to read to you -- like I'm just telling you now in case I forget this later on in the book. But like the names, like these are names that we still know and the car companies are still around 100 years later. So you hear names like Ferrari, Bugatti, Maserati, Lamborghini. They all knew each other. They were all in the relative same area, again, and going after similar goals. And that's just mind-blowing to me. So I'll talk more about Bugatti because -- which surprised me, so I don't remember if I learned this in the other biography on Enzo, it was the fact that Bugatti was really the blueprint -- and Maserati, the Maserati Brothers to some degree, for what Ferrari wanted to do. And it was fascinating that other people had laid out a blueprint for him, and then he winds up surpassing them. So anyways, that just -- that thought spun in my mind because in this section of the book, it's talking about he's going to Fiat because Fiat's the leading technology company of its day. And it's funny how like that's true then, but it's not how we think of things -- that's not how we think of the company now. Okay. So let's go back to this point in his life. So he goes, "Okay, I'm going to travel all the way to Turin. I'm going to try to get a job." This is not going to go good for him. One, he doesn't have an experience, and two, there's a huge influx of unemployed Italian males coming home from the war.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so it says, "It was into this exclusive milieu that the poorly educated, still unhealthy, totally unqualified Enzo Ferrari poked his nose. It was useless. The postwar job market was glutted with veterans, and Ferrari was doomed from the moment he entered." I want to bring this to your attention because this is something -- this rejection is something that he holds inside of him for 50 years. He called it the lowest day of his life. "Ferrari wrote of this moment with poignancy. He wandered through the busy streets to a bench in Valentino Park. And then he says, 'I was alone. My father and brother were no more. Overcome by loneliness and despair, I wept.'" And so this is the lowest point of his life. He's depressed. He has no resources. He just got shut down. And he's going to reference this because 50 years later, he's going -- remember, this is Fiat. Well, I don't know if you know this actually. I don't know if any of you explicitly remember, Fiat buys Ferrari. And so 50 years after this point, he goes back. And once he sells the company, he sits on that same bench, and he essentially has this like wrong in his mind rectified. So it says, "The slight by Fiat festered in his brain, creating an anger that blossomed with the passage of time." The reason I'm reading this section to you because anger and revenge are extremely effective motivators of human behavior. And we see it's definitely a dark side to Enzo for sure. And part of that is the fact that he's got this giant ego, and he wants other people -- it's very important how other people view him. And so he wants to prove, "Hey, you made a mistake." "Revenge was a priority within him that would not be subdued, and repayment in kind was a debt he swore to fulfill no matter how many years it might take." And then from here, the book just goes through. Something that I try to bring to your attention every time is, it's not like he wakes up, "I'm a poor 18-year-old with no father, no brother, on this bench, and overnight, I'm the greatest car manufacturer of all time." Enzo's story is very similar to a lot of these other biographies. You see, what's my next opportunity from here? And then once you get to that spot, then you look around, okay, what's the next best opportunity? And he just goes from -- he pursues each opportunity one step at a time, like just like all of us can, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so it says -- he winds up going and seeking, and he said, "Okay, I want to work in this industry. Let me go find out where these people hang out." And so it says, "It was only days after Enzo's arrival in Turin that he began to display the greedy resourcefulness and powers of persuasion that were to become his trademarks. He began to poke into the thriving community of automobile manufacturers, drivers, mechanics, and promoters that had sprung up as satellites to the Fiat operation." And so he just does whatever he can. He's just, "I just need -- I got to get my foot in the door of this industry, and then I'll figure out a better way." The very first job he gets, if you think about it, he hooks up with his car dealer, this guy named Giovanni. And Giovanni hires him because Giovanni is purchasing all the army trucks. Like the Italian army trucks, there's a giant surplus. And he just figured, "Okay, I'll buy these surplus army trucks from the government. I can get them for really cheap. I'll strip them down to the bare chassis." And then he's going to resell the bare chassis to a coach maker. That's what they call the cars at this time. I mean if you look at them -- I went and looked at like what -- the first like Alfa Romeo when Ferrari works there. And they don't look like cars. They're called cars, but they definitely don't look like cars to us today. And so he said, "Okay, I'm going to take these bare truck chassis, and I'm going to ship them to this coach maker in Milan. And then this coach maker is going to put passenger car bodies on top of them." Because a ton of -- there's a giant demand for automobiles or these rather premium automobiles in postwar Italy, just like there was in postwar America. So Ferrari is taken as a general handyman. And then he's also hired to transport and to drive and get the trucks or the truck chassis up to where they need to go. So it says, "Ferrari carried Italian" -- oh, this is interesting. "Ferrari carried Italian driving license number 1363." So they actually numbered them. That would imply that he's one of the nation's earliest motorists. So he uses this job and then -- to meet other people.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He eventually is going to meet -- this is a mentor of sorts. So he's just going to -- again, this job serves a point, just so he can meet new people. Once he meets new people, they tell him about other opportunities. If he feels that an opportunity is better, he's going to jump. So he jumps from opportunity to opportunity. This guy's name is -- these Italian words are going to kill me. I can't even pronounce English words correctly. There's no way I'm going to pronounce these Italian names. And they have fantastic names, by the way, or cities. So I'm just going to call this guy Ugo. I have no idea how to pronounce his last name. Ugo is going to be a mentor of sorts to a young Enzo Ferrari. Ugo hires him as a chief test driver for the new automaker. This is -- it's CMN. It says, "The company was embarked on a full-scale campaign to manufacture high-performance vehicles. And as was the universal custom of the day, the factory was entering a variety of races." Ferrari was hired by Ugo to be his assistant. He had begun his climb up the ladder. And so he couldn't get into Fiat, couldn't get in Alfa Romeo yet, so he starts at the very bottom. CMN is a tiny firm. It's a new firm. And this is just a little bit about the occupational hazards. I thought this paragraph was rather amusing. So it says, "The tiny CMN firm could not afford to transport its race cars by rail or truck." So Ferrari and Ugo were assigned the job of driving to the race. So he's got to transport the cars to the race. It was hardly a leisurely tour through the countryside. Ferrari recalled that they drove into a nasty blizzard one day, and they were set upon by a pack of wolves, which had to be dispensed by shots from the pistol that he always carried under his seat. So imagine if one of the occupational hazards of your job is that you might be set upon by a pack of wolves. So we see I'm skipping ahead, obviously going very fast through the book. "Ferrari soon left CMN to seek his fortune in other realms of the Italian automobile business and to further his career as a racing driver," which is just another step up. "Shortly thereafter, he began an association with Alfa Romeo." So again, Alfa Romeo, gigantic successful company of its day. I think it winds up being nationalized by the Italian government. I think Mussolini nationalized it if I'm not mistaken. "Enzo Ferrari began" -- Mussolini's in his book quite a lot. I'm going to skip over most of those parts.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Ferrari began an association with Alfa Romeo that was to last for nearly two decades." This is another important part I want to bring to your attention, is how long Enzo Ferrari had to be committed to his desire to be successful. He is like 50 years old, something like that, by the time he's able to start the company Ferrari under his own name. As that sentence just hinted, "He began an association with Alfa Romeo that was to last for nearly two decades." So this is where he starts to race cars. He's going to become a car salesman as well, and then eventually, he's going to run the racing team for Alfa Romeo. And I need to give you a bit about his personality, though, because this is one of the most important things to learn about him. And it says, "There is no question that by this time, Enzo Ferrari had become a compelling salesman and manipulator." So this section reminds me of something I learned when -- and you see it a lot actually, but what comes to my mind is when I read George Lucas' biography. I'm pretty sure this is Founders #35. So George Lucas is like many of the founders that we cover, he was successful studying history. He liked to read biographies. He wanted to know how the great people of history thought, right? And it wasn't until he's in his -- like I think he's like 23 years old, and he meets Francis Ford Coppola who, I think, is like 28 at the time. And Francis Ford Coppola becomes like one of his best friends and mentors. And he's the first of the independent filmmakers that actually figures a way to break into Hollywood at the time. So like what George Lucas was trying to do, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, another example of all these guys knowing each other at the very beginning, which is crazy when you think about the careers. Brian De Palma was also in the group that they went on to have. But he says something in his biography about Coppola. And based on his historic knowledge of reading biographies, he said, "Francis could sell ice to Eskimos. He had charisma beyond logic. I can see now what kind of men the great Caesars of history were. Their magnetism," that applies to Francis Ford Coppola. It definitely applies to Enzo Ferrari.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so I don't think we can overstate the importance of being able to be persuasive, to be able to communicate with other humans and the impact it's going to have on your work. Reminds me, if you read, though, the biography of Warren Buffett, right, I mean there's a bunch of them, but he mentions this over and over again. And he says like, the best investment he ever made was the $100 he spent for the Dale Carnegie public speaking course. And I think that statement speaks volumes. And if you don't already have this ability, like he's clearly telling you, "Hey, find a way to learn. It's just a skill. Like any other one, you can learn how to do it. Let's go back to this paragraph. What's also surprising is even though he knew he was persuasive, he knew he was able to -- I mean manipulate, that's the word he's going to use, he does have a little bit of impostor syndrome because he's still like this poor, uneducated kid. Despite his obvious powers of persuasion and his sufficiently vivid personality to push his ways into the inner sanctums of the Alfa Romeo test department, Ferrari remained gripped by his lower-class bumpkin image. At one point, he lamented, 'I feel so provincial.' But that sense of inadequacy was more than compensated for his" -- this is really like the way to think about this, "By his street-wise cunning and a brash ability to deal with the social and professional superiors like a man twice his age." So he's also doing races. I'm skipping over most of that part because he was -- I mean, by his own admission, not a great race car driver, way better at obviously being the agitator of men. But this is the problem that a young Enzo is trying to solve, why he's doing the work at Alfa Romeo. "The modest firm of Alfa Romeo was still operating in the minor leagues of the automobile racing business. Chances of their victory in major events seemed a distant hope because they're going against the mighty Fiat, Mercedes," all these other people that have way more resources than they do at this point in history. "It was simply too great to even consider a high placing in the major Grand Prix events. But Ferrari plunged into his job with typical vigor." It is around this time, though, that he's going to start making more money he's ever made in his life, and that's going to come from actual car sales. So it says, "His aggressive sales tactics permitted him to become an exclusive sales agent for Alfa Romeo automobiles," in this little section of Italy that he's in. I'm going to skip the name.

By urging -- "by using his growing reputation as a racing driver, he artfully enhanced the marquee image among the rich clientele in the region. As his financial fortunes in the car business increased, his racing career entered into a severe decline." He is 24 years old. And so as his racing career declines, he does something smart. He realizes that the failure of his one dream, right, is -- remember, when he looked at his friend when he was like, what, 18, what, however old he was, maybe 19. "I'm going to be a race car driver." That was his dream, right? But his failure on one dream leads to discovery of his true talent. It's something that he's going to do for the rest of his life. "For all his attempts at reaching the big time of major league racing, Enzo Ferrari would be doomed to the role of spectator. Yet his stature as an organizer and leader of men would soar to unexpected heights because he was able to strengthen the Alfa Romeo team and aid in propelling it to the very pinnacle of the sport." And so as he's turning around the fortunes of Alfa Romeo, he's introduced to the very real specter of death that this sport produces, which is unbelievable. I think the best description of that is that little fun book I did on Founders #97, Go Like Hell. If also you've seen -- if you've seen the movie Ford v Ferrari with Christian Bale, Matt Damon, Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby. I also did a podcast on Carroll Shelby. Carroll Shelby is by far one of the most likable founders I've ever read. He just -- there's a bunch of interviews with him on YouTube right before he died. And it's like -- I think he's like in his 80s. He's just hilarious. I love that guy. But that's who -- Matt Damon plays him in that movie if you haven't seen it. You could also listen to Founders #99. That's Carroll Shelby. So we see that he just -- death, how much death is involved in this sport, it's just unbelievable. This is going to be his mentor, the one that hired him. "Ugo spun off one of the ultrafast bends and was killed. Ugo was gone. The man who had brought Ferrari into the sport and given him his first chance to drive was dead. He would be the first of literally dozens of men who would fall around Ferrari, victims of this crudest of sports."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this is where we see that Enzo just really made the smart decision to alter his focus, and he had a talent for recruiting highly talented employees. And so he winds up recruiting two of the best engineers and also drivers. He does this -- I mean this is his MO, right? This is his playbook for his whole life actually. And what happens is now you have this Alfa Romeo team, which was the underdog, beating Fiat, which wasn't supposed to happen. And so it says, "While Ferrari could accept no credit for beating Fiat on the track" -- meaning he wasn't driving, "His contribution to their overall defeat by aiding in the defection of Bazzi and Jano" -- these are people he recruited, "Was pivotal. Following the Paris flight, the once unbeatable Fiat racing department was in shambles. Their losses prompted Fiat to drop racing after the 1924 season. A short-lived return would be made a few years later. But for all intents and purposes, they departed the sport forever. Considering Enzo's deeply rooted sense of honor and his need for revenge" -- remember, this is the firm that would not hire him, "One can be sure that this capitulation by the company had been rejected -- that had rejected him six years earlier was lustily celebrated by Enzo Ferrari." That just also popped into my mind as I'm rereading this. There is so many opportunities that are outside of Enzo's control that he benefits from just by showing up. This idea that Fiat gives up, cars break down, they don't get through immigration, Enzo was obsessed. He was -- most car racing teams at the time would say, "Hey, focus on whatever." There's all these like different -- focus on Grand Prix or focus on this country or focus on this one type of race. And Enzo was like, "No, I'm going to -- if there's a race, I'm showing up." And so they wouldn't have -- now that'd be crazy, wouldn't be able to do that. You'd have specialized cars, everything else. They would just retrofit really fast. Like if maybe you had a car -- a long-endurance race, so you need to have a different type of vehicle for that. Maybe you have one that's just going around the same track, like Indy 500, so you have a car for that. Maybe you have a street race, it's 1,000 miles. You have a car for that. Enzo was just like, "No, I'm showing up at everything."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this idea, I just realized, that prompted Fiat to drop out, he wins a lot almost by default by the fact that he just shows up. I think there's a huge message there. It goes back to what Steve Jobs told us, "Half of what separate" -- his famous quote that I'll never forget, and I think it's so important for people to repeat over and over again, what Steve Jobs said, "Half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the not successful ones is just pure perseverance." Perseverance, persistence, whatever you want to call it, Enzo had that in spades. So now we get to -- when Enzo is 31 years old, this is going to be the start of the Scuderia Ferrari. And that word just means racing stable. It's kind of like a -- it's a joint venture of sorts between Enzo Ferrari and Alfa Romeo. It says, with their money and Ferrari's connections and racing expertise, why not pool their talents and form a Scuderia? The deal would be simple. It would be -- a limited partnership would be formed in which the shareholders would set up an operation to buy, race and perhaps someday build high-performance cars. And so this is what Enzo's going to do for quite a while. It's almost like two decades, something like that, maybe 15 years from this point in the story before he sets out on his own, like under his own name, that is. But this section is really about the fact that he felt triumphant. He gets to return to the city of his birth, and he's now transformed himself at a rather young age from agent and employee to the founder of his own company. Ferrari symbolically viewed the formation of the new Scuderia as a triumphant homecoming to a place that, save for a few racing enthusiasts, had ignored his presence. "My return to Modena was kind of a mental revolt," he later wrote. "When I went away, I had merely some slight reputation for being a strange" -- this is hilarious. This is how people thought of him before -- when he left away -- or when he went away, rather. "When I went away, I had merely some slight reputation for being a strange young man keen on cars and racing but did not seem to have any particular capability."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So now what is this? This is like 12 years has passed since that point, right? "My return, in order to transform myself from a racing driver and team organizer into a small industrialist, represented an attempt to prove to myself and others that during the 20 years I was with Alfa Romeo, not all my reputation was secondhand and gained by the efforts and skills of other people. The time had come for me to see how far I could get on my own efforts." Now this is what I mentioned earlier, that there is always a blueprint in these books. They're usually somebody has -- they see somebody that came before them, and they're like, "I want that." And for Ferrari, Maserati brothers were also racing and producing cars under their own name, which is what Ferrari wants to do. But largely, his blueprint was Bugatti. And so here, it says, "If there was ever a prototype operation for what Enzo Ferrari envisioned for the Scuderia, it had to be the legendary" -- I don't know how to pronounce his first name, but we all know his last name, "Bugatti." "This part" -- this is how they describe Bugatti. And this is really interesting because I've heard the car name -- the car, I knew they sell for like $1 million, something crazy like that, maybe more, but I didn't know much about the person. I should actually see if I can find a biography on him. "This part artist, part engineer, part entrepreneur, part sculptor has, since 1910, created an automotive fiefdom in a tiny village. The Bugatti estate included a" -- and we talk about it a lot, the benefit of building your own world within a world, right? That's kind of what company building can be, and then you can also do that to more elements of your life. But check this out. This Bugatti literally made his own world. It sounds fantastic. So he has this little automotive fiefdom in a tiny village. "The Bugatti estate included a small, elegant inn for the entertainment of guests and customers, a stable of thoroughbred horses, and the factory itself. His automobiles were and remain a stunning combination of industrial aesthetics and the jewelers' art. It looks as if Fabergé had somehow been able to motorize an egg. And I think -- the book gives some detail about the character that Bugatti was. He like dressed in costume and everything. It's just hilarious. I love seeing people who's like, "Hey, I got one life. I'm going do whatever I want, and I'm going to really live it."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Bugatti was just one of a bevy of colorful eccentrics, this -- nobles, playboy, dreamy commoners, and hard-eyed egomaniacs who populated the world of European motorsports in the 1930s. He certainly -- this is still about Bugatti. "He certainly stood above the rest in terms of lifestyle. He had created a feudal barony around the spidery machines he manufactured in limited quantities and sold only to those he personally deemed worthy. By contrast, Enzo Ferrari was then still a drab, simple journeyman laboring in a small garage in an Italian backwater. That is such an important point. "The example Bugatti was setting did not escape him. Everybody has" -- there's always a blueprint. Bugatti was Ferrari's blueprint. This is so important. "Bugatti was a prototype for success. He was manufacturing cars for the very wealthy and fielding his own team of professional and wealthy amateurs." This is exactly what Ferrari wants to do. "Surely, if Bugatti could succeed at this, a similar concept could be developed on a more modest basis for Ferrari." So Ferrari is extremely gifted at running a team, recruiting the best people, provoking them, poking them, motivating them, manipulating them. So I guess a fantastic success in this new Ferrari Scuderia -- or actually, no, Scuderia Ferrari, sorry. It's fantastic and successful. And so as we've seen before, basically, what I'm trying to tell you here, I know you read this, too. So sales of -- now they're racing cars, and then what happens when you win races? You get a ton of publicity. People are going to want that car. "So sales to private customers were thriving and would continue to grow as the Scuderia's success on the racetracks extended in" -- excuse me, "Expanded in number and magnitude." So what hit me now is because -- since the last time I read biography on Enzo Ferrari, I have read two biographies on Michael Jordan. And I realized Ferrari sold cars, and Michael Jordan sells shoes for the same reason: humans are attracted to winners.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so the Douche says, "This would take decades to develop a race team that's capable of taking out Ferrari." So then Lee walks over to him, throws his folder on the table, and he says, "Ferrari is bankrupt. Enzo spent every lira," the currency of Italy. "He got chasing perfection. You know something? He got there. Now he's broke." And so that scene, what Lee is also saying at the end, where it's like Ferrari's bankrupt, he spent every dollar chasing perfection, this is -- he's got something in common with other -- Enzo's got in common with other -- some of the greatest founders in history have all similar patterns. Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, they would spend every dollar they had improving the product. There's a great line in one of Walt Disney's biographies where his brother is the one that's like dealt with the financing of the company and always had to like fight Walt and his crazy perfectionism. And his brother is like, "What is this going to cost?" He's like, "I'm innovating. I'll tell you what it costs when I'm done." There's just no way that Walt was going to compromise his vision for perfection. That's why you see the company he built. He built one of the greatest companies in human history. Steve Jobs is the same way. And this is very early. He's like -- it was in the mid-1980s, Steve Jobs goes to talk to -- I think it was Stanford. I can't remember the -- anyway, most likely had to be Stanford. And the business school students are asking questions and like asking about the stock price. And he like completely waves off their answers, like, "I don't give a s_*_ about the stock price." He's like -- and then he launches into the fact that he's going to -- one day, he's going to build a computer that you can hold in your hand, like some kind of common -- almost like the early version like the iPad. And he talked about like his passion for making and selling great products. He's like, "No, my focus is on making the very best product possible. It's not on making the most money." Walt Disney was the same way. Steve Jobs is the same way. And Enzo Ferrari was the exact same way. So anyways, let me wrap this -- tie this background to what we were talking about in the book, is the fact that -- we talked about Jordan. Like if Jordan didn't win all these championships, if he wasn't regarded as the greatest player of his generation, no one would buy his shoes.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then you fast forward 20 years after he's retired, his shoe brand is doing over $3 billion a year. He gets a 5% royalty of sales. That means Jordan right now, 20 years after he stopped playing the game, is making $150 million a year just from his shoes. And it also ties into the idea of why you should keep it -- that's the Naval quote, that you should keep redefining what you do until you're the best in the world at it. It's not like the second-best player, the second-best person in the NBA sells 10% or 20% or 50% of the shoe volume. Jordan gets almost all the profits. I just think there's -- what I'm trying to say is like all these -- they seem like seemingly disparate ideas. If you combine them, there's a lot of like information there that's useful to our careers. The idea that humans are attracted to the best, so they flock to whatever that is, it could be the best shoe, the best car, the best purse, it doesn't matter. And then if you can somehow identify, even if it's just a tiny niche to be the best in whatever field you're in rather, you have these disproportionate returns. And part of being the best in what -- if you're going to be the best in the world at something, you have to be obsessed with it. Steve Jobs was obsessed with his work. Walt Disney was obsessed with his work. Enzo Ferrari was obsessed with his work. They all produced the best product in their category. So I hope that makes sense. I hope I could tie that together. It's just very obvious, when you start reading across all these different biographies, like, okay, these people all think differently, but they think differently in the same way. They are more closely aligned with each other than they are with like the average person on the street. I need to go fast forward in the book, though, because I have a ton of highlights, and I'm going to be here all day talking to you about this. This is going to be like an audiobook, for God's sake. Okay. Let's see. This is acting like a champion before he was a champion, a formidable individual, in complete control of his organization. So it says, "The persona of the man who is running the operation was beginning to take shape, that would remain consistent throughout its life. While still only in his mid-30s, Ferrari was firmly in control of the operation and given to fits of temper that would descend on the place like summer thunderstorms.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

A badly fabricated part" -- remember, they're -- so they're focused on racing, but they're making cars to fund their racing operation. And he -- you can think of him as the exact opposite of Ford, right? It's very interesting that they even had a negotiation. I don't personally think Enzo even considered selling to them. But the idea, Ford had this leading -- if you go and listen to my podcast I did on Henry Ford, like he figured out how to apply mass production techniques to automobiles before anybody else did, right? And he was better at it than anybody else. Ferrari is in the opposite end of the spectrum. These are handmade products built by Italian artisans, okay? It's not at all what -- like it's a complete opposite strategy that Henry Ford took. So it says," A badly fabricated part or the late arrival of a worker would send his temper soaring and strong men scurrying for cover. At the same time, he could be a model of decorum, transforming himself into a charming maître d' when the moment demanded it as when a highborn noble or a Fascist official member were in" -- this is Italy before World War II, right, "Or a Fascist arrived at the scuderia or a wealthy customer expressed interest in spending extra. Enzo Ferrari was on his way to becoming the consummate manager of men." This is repeated 100 times in the book, that his greatest skill was the fact that he was able to manage people, to recruit the very best talent, to manage them, to manipulate them. He's not doing the work. He's not the engineer. He's not the designer. He's the agitator of men. I can't -- like I can't repeat that enough, okay? He was -- "Enzo Ferrari was on his way to becoming the consummate manager of men, not docile, soft-willed men, but proud, fiercely competitive, egocentric men" -- these are drivers we're talking about now, "Whose livelihood, if not their very reason for living, depended on this most demanding and unforgiving of sports." So in between all these highlights, there's a lot of people dying. There's some sick stories in the book, like maybe the driver -- and the driver -- and like two drivers might die, but the crash like results in the car going into the field -- into the stand -- or not even stands. They're racing on the road, for God's sake, and 20 people or 20 spectators dying. It's insane.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, for the -- but he's also extremely successful at winning races. "For the first time since its formation, Ferrari Scuderia could be considered at the top level of the business. It was able to compete head-to-head with the likes of Bugatti and Maserati. For all the death and acrimony, Enzo Ferrari could look back on the past season with a certain satisfaction." And this is -- I double underline this point because this jumps out. If you study Enzo Ferrari, also very useful trait for us to have, "befitting only a man with a diamond-hard will to win at all costs." So you could imagine, if you're traveling all over the world, you've got drivers dying, you've got these complex machines that you're having to build essentially from scratch, there's all kinds of moving parts. They constantly don't like -- don't go to -- things don't go to plan. So this important -- like the important ability to have like -- the ability to adapt, to be flexible, the ability for improvisation, these are all very, very common traits in the history of entrepreneurship. Enzo Ferrari is no different. I just want to pull out a couple of sentences here because I thought this was absolutely fantastic. So it's discussing like all the stuff that happens. And it says, "If they were to survive, it would be thanks to their wits and their ability" -- check this line out, "And their ability to play the ancient game of life. Few men understood this game better than Ferrari." I just love that idea. "If they were to survive, it would be thanks to their wits and their ability to play the ancient game of life." And if you think about the people that we're starting on the podcast together, we're not setting people that are great at school. We're setting people that were great at life. I want to go into more about the eccentricities of Enzo Ferrari. He got a lot of weird phobias. Also extremely -- I think I have more highlights later on, but this guy was extremely adherent to routine. He had almost the same routine for the last like 60 years of his life. It's remarkable. I don't know if I'd want to live my life that way, but I'm saying he's adherent to that.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, "Ferrari would refuse to fly. He was suspicious of trains and would only travel by automobile. He would not use elevators. He maintained a less than wholly analytical view of life's technical complexities. Now this section I thought was interesting because you have somebody that worked for both Bugatti and Ferrari. And he gives us some insight here. And so it says, "Now the Scuderia was a bareboned, hard-muscled professional racing operation." So he's describing Ferrari at that -- the point he comes in. This immediately became apparent to outsiders like Dreyfus, who later wrote, "The difference between being a member of the Bugatti team and the Ferrari was virtually night and day. With Ferrari, I learned the business of racing for there was no doubt that he was a businessman. Enzo Ferrari loved racing. Of that there was no question. It was more than an enthusiast's love but one tempered with the practical realization that this was a good way to build a nice, profitable empire. I knew that he was going to be a big man one day." Bugatti was a patron. Enzo Ferrari was the boss. Bugatti was imperious. Ferrari was impenetrable. So now he's about to turn 40. I want to give you a description of what I mentioned at the beginning -- very beginning of the podcast, something that I most admire about him. It says, "He just had a singular focus." Now I don't think -- like he obviously didn't have a balanced life. So my own personal blueprint, I've told you over and over again, is at Founders #93, I think because he identified like a handful of things and was good at all of them and didn't make the same mistakes that a lot of people make where they overoptimize for their work at the expense of like personal life. But I want to read -- actually, I'm going to read a quote from that book Go Like Hell, and then I'm going to go back to this book. It's describing, "Enzo Ferrari in Go Like Hell. He worked seven days a week, 12 to 16 hours a day, holidays included. At night, he returned to Modena. He felt extremely emotionally attached to his city. Except for his daily drives to Maranello where his factory is, he refused to leave Modena for almost any reason. He did not attend races, not even the Italian Grand Prix, one of the world's most famous circuits.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

When asked about the root of his mania, his obsession with victory, Ferrari told one reporter in 1958, 'Everything I've done, I did because I couldn't do anything less. One day, I want to build a car that's faster than all of them, and then I want to die.'" So these kind of statements, this is why I can describe him as one of history's greatest obsessives. That's 1958. So this is in the future. We're still not there yet. This is maybe a decade, a decade and a half earlier, something like that. He's now at 40 completely focused on work. He lives a simple no-frills life. So it says, "Enzo Ferrari was immersed in the life of a full-time racing capo, with all of his energies concentrated on the team's competition schedule. Ferrari was still living frugally in a tiny two-bedroom apartment above the factory" -- or the racing team actually, the Scuderia. "Ferrari was a hard taskmaster. He had increasingly limited travel schedule. The little family fell into the daily pattern of lower-middle-class Italian life. Enzo Ferrari was born with simple tastes. And even after he became rich and prominent, he retained the ways of a simple, uncluttered man. During the 1930s, every ounce of his energies and every lira in his pocket was being plowed back into the business. He lived a modest frugal life. And so you see that he's completely dedicated to this. It is not a job. It is a passion. It's something he loves. You can actually tell a lot about people by not only who they admire but who they dislike. And so there is a -- the government of Italy gets involved in all kinds of stuff. I'm going to skip over a large part of that in the book. But they wind up putting in place like these bureaucrats, you can think about them. They're like more like analytical. Enzo had soul in the game. And so this is a description of the person he hated more than anyone else. And you see kind of -- he views himself as the opposite. "The same analytical approach to problems that Gobbato" -- that's the guy that he hates, "This instantly placed him at loggerheads with Enzo Ferrari." A group -- so it talks about Enzo and his group. It said how they differed. "They were a group without formal training who relied on a mixture of racetrack empiricism and raw instinct to create machines.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I'm sorry, this guy's name is Ricart. He's saying, "This guy Ricart had the same analytical approach as Gobbato." So Ricart's the guy that he hates. "Ricart had no abiding passion for motor racing." So Enzo's going to be disgusted by this guy. "He was a pure mechanical engineer by trade and tended to approach each project with the kind of aloof methodology that made him more akin to a surgeon than a grease-stained racing-car mechanic." There's like this whole, like, battle that goes on. It's going to wind up leading to Alfa Romeo buying out most of -- buying out Enzo Ferrari. This is also going to lead after the wars over to Enzo creating Ferrari, the company that we know today. "Alfa Romeo bought 80% of the Scuderia Ferrari. The struggle was long and difficult. After all, Enzo Ferrari was the commodore of Alfa Romeo's Grand Prix racing program. To lose this position had to imply failure or at least displeasure in the eyes of his superiors. This -- the period of 1938 to -- the period of 1935 to 1938 was laden with frustration for a man who wore his" -- here, describing Enzo, "Who wore his pride on his sleeve and who for 15 years had assiduously and successfully curried favor with the company hierarchy." So the author goes on for quite a few pages about this war, this battle between Ferrari and Ricart, and all these other people that's going to force him out. But I want to draw your attention to the fact that Enzo knew what his talent was, which is another smart move by him. "I have never considered myself a designer or an inventor but only one who gets things moving and keeps them running, my innate talent for stirring up men." "This is where Enzo Ferrari was at his best, immersed in the genesis of a daring new design that he believed would bring victory on the racetrack. As the summer heat of Modena bore down on them, transforming the workshop into a fuming hell of simmering, deafening, maddening motion" -- Enzo had a -- he just loved chaos. "He seemed to gain strength.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Each night, the exhausted team would gather in one of the little shops -- or excuse me, restaurants around the neighborhood to eat and to muse about their progress, then they'd fall in bed for a few hours' sleep before beginning again at dawn." And so that's seven days a week, 12- to 16-hour schedule that he imposed on himself, he also imposed on everybody around him, no holidays. I don't -- he doesn't pay attention to any of that, doesn't really pay attention to any current affairs, anything. He's just all about racing, like that one singular focus that he maintained from the 1930s until the day he died, I think in 1988, something like that. So eventually, this Ricart guy is going to win this battle. This is when Enzo was forced out of Alfa Romeo, not necessarily a bad thing for him. "Enzo's dismissal from Alfa Romeo was clearly a greater blow to his ego than to his bank account. The buyout of the Scuderia and severance payments left him in solid financial shape." So he had a nice little nest egg going, and he doesn't really spend money on anything but his cars. "He maintained a simple life, still living in a small apartment on the second floor of the old Scuderia building. Enzo Ferrari could look back on the past 20 years with considerable satisfaction. He had begun with nothing, save for a tiny inheritance from his father and, through hard work and chutzpah, had become a major figure in international motorsports. He was 41 years old." So this is actually still before World War II. I don't know if I misspoke earlier. "His severance agreement had stipulated that he could not use the old Scuderia Ferrari name or directly engage in motor racing for four years. Therefore, Ferrari set to work establishing a custom machine shop." So he uses some of his nest egg to start this other company. "He invested substantial capital on equipping the old building with lathes, milling machines, grinders and shapers." So this is more about his intensity that I was just mentioning. Two people that want him to build, two guys come to him to build a pair of sports cars for this legendary race. It's called like the Mille Miglia. I've looked up how to pronounce that. That's the best I can do, I'm sorry. And so he said, "Okay, I'll build them." And then he says, he reaches -- he's like, "Okay, agreed." He reached this decision at a dinner on Christmas Eve in 1939.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"When most families were together on one of the holiest nights of the year, Enzo Ferrari was conducting business. Christmas Eve was a sacred time reserved for family gatherings and obligations" -- obligatory, that's not the word, "Mandatory attendance at Church services. That Enzo Ferrari would spend such a period with racing associates underscores not only the singular intensity with which he engaged in business but also the hypocrisy of his testimonials of devotion to his wife and son. This behavior was hardly unusual for him, and others also found him boring ahead with his work on various Easter Sundays, Christmases or any other of the multitude of holidays and feast days that dot the Italian calendar." So fast forwarding throughout the war, like his factory gets bombed by the Allies multiple times. After the war, the electricity in Italy is scarce, product -- like materials are scarce, and this is the environment. And he says, "Hey, I'm going start my own company." This is Ferrari. And it says -- and this is the reason. So he closes down. Now he's -- many years have passed. He can use that name again. He can get back into racing. "His reason for returning to the automobile business was simple: it was all he knew. The machine tools had been a transitional -- had been transitional stop-gaps for the duration of the war. But his reputation, his contacts, his passion centered on cars. And there was no logical reason that this would not be his area of concentration once the fighting stopped." And so another way to think about that is he knew what his circle of competence was, and he was going to stay within that for the rest of his life. I need to point out something here when he's building his first car, one of his first cars, that's extremely important. And this is an idea that people are like, "Oh, I need to innovate it." Like you don't. Like he was not -- Rolls-Royce was the exact same way about what I'm going to read to you, because I've read the biography of the founding engineering genius of Rolls-Royce, Henry Royce. And his method was taking existing product. The Rolls-Royce method is the same method that Enzo Ferrari is using, is what I'm trying to tell you: take an existing product and make every part of it better.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, "No Ferrari ever built was a glittering example of daring technology. The V12 that they're making right now is one of the very few examples in the history of the company that could be described as remotely revolutionary." This is so important. "If Ferrari was so insistent on original ideas, his company would not have got off the ground for it never ever introduced a new idea." And he describes this perfectly in one sentence, "All we wanted to do was build a conventional engine but one that was outstanding." So again, I think this is really important, just take an existing product and make every part of it better. So I want to go back to Chinetti that I told you about earlier. He's going to develop the American market that proves to be extremely lucrative for Ferrari. And I got to point this out, like he's, what? 48 years old at this point in the story. Things are not really going well for his company. Like again, post-World War II, there's not a lot of money. There's not a lot of electricity. There's not a lot of products. So they were in a meeting. "He found Enzo Ferrari in the same dingy two-story building. Ferrari was in a bad way. He looked haggard beyond his 48 years. His eyes were red-rimmed with fatigue. His hulking frame was slumped behind a desk in the large, unheated office. On that day in the dingy icebox, they spoke of the future. Each tried to conjure up some optimism, but it came in brief spurts, only to fade into the morass of broken dreams." So Chinetti had been in America. And so this is what -- he's like, "Hey, let me be your guy that can bring your products" -- because Enzo never visited America. He wasn't really interested in it at all. He wasn't really interested in anything except his like little town and his factory. And so Chinetti plays an extremely important role. "Chinetti spoke of his years in America where a war effort had been mounted that by comparison made Italian industrialists look like little potters."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So what Chinetti observed and what he's describing is what is the American material output during World War II. I did an entire podcast on this. It's in between, I think, Founders #168 and 169. It's a bonus episode. It's called Freedom's Forge. And I found that book because it was recommended by Patrick Collison. Patrick Collison is the founder and CEO of Stripe. I told you this before, if you go to patrickcollison.com/fast, Patrick, like most great founders, has this deep historical knowledge, and he collects examples of groups of people doing really hard things really quickly, which, of course, is probably what he's thinking like building out Stripe, right, doing something extremely hard with a group of people really quickly. And so if you want to -- you read the book, I mean Patrick recommended it, he's got a really interesting mind. And if you want to check out that podcast before you read the book, you'll have a good overview of what's taking place. But this is what Chinetti is about to tell Ferrari. It says, "In the rush to spit out millions of airplanes, tanks, trucks, rifles, landing craft, prefabricated buildings, portable bridges, helmets" -- it just goes on and on. I'm just going to skip over that part, okay? "And God knows what else, the American colossus had created miraculous tools of mass production assembly-line techniques so ingenious that full-size cargo ships could be built by a man named Kaiser." He is referencing Henry Kaiser. I did a podcast on him. That's Founders #66. The reason you should listen to that is because he built over 100 companies in his day, built the Hoover Dam. He was -- Henry Kaiser was as famous in his time as like Elon Musk is today. So it says, "They were so ingenious that full-size cargo ships could be built by a man named Kaiser in less than a week. 'How,' asked Chinetti, 'Could Ferrari hope to compete against this Western industrial might?'" Enzo is not going to because he understood you can't out-Ford Ford, right? So you go in the complete opposite direction. And why is that an opening for them? Because Chinetti realizes, "There is a rich upper class whose taste were European" -- in America, that is. "He had seen them, met them, and gained their trust. They would pay a king's ransom for such elite machines and he" -- Luigi Chinetti. Did I pronounce his name wrong earlier? Luigi, Luigi Chinetti. "Meant to exploit that naïve colonial lust.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Chinetti was firm: build five cars a year for America, and he would sell them for unseemly amounts of money. Give him the opportunity, and he would sell 20 a year, a number on that dank day" -- This is the whole point of why I'm reading this to you because think about how far Ferrari has come. This is now, what, 60 -- what are we, 70 years after this conversation. I mean there's a Ferrari dealership right next to my house that has more than 20 Ferraris in there, right? So he's like, "Build -- give me 20 a year. I will sell 20 a year," and "a number that on that dank day in Modena sounded as astronomical as if they had been discussing General Motors' annual output. Ferrari agreed." And so the way he's going to sell cars is still the way -- the best way he knows. This is a simple idea, but it's not easy. It's the same thing that Jordan says. Jordan says, "The marketing I did for my business was on the court. If I won championships, I would sell shoes." If Ferrari wins races, he's going to sell cars. "The rules were simple: build successful racing cars that improve the image of the company, and rich men will flock to the door to obtain similar cars with which to play out their fantasies. By announcing the new line of cars, he could expect a flurry of orders from wealthy sportsmen and perhaps an infusion of deposit funds to carry on the work. He did not have a lot of money." This is very similar to early days of Tesla. They start selling this Roadster for $250,000 or whatever it is. I mean I guess they still do this to the day with the new Roadster. They were taking deposits of like $50,000, gives the company capital upfront to actually go and build a car. Ferrari is doing that 70 years ago or whatever it was. So I mentioned earlier that Enzo benefits just because he shows up everywhere. And he lets -- as long as he survives, he lets his competitors make mistakes. Maserati, they've gotten away now that -- they're started by the Maserati Brothers. This other industrialist named like Orsi, he buys it. And this is really what Steve Jobs talked about over and over again on the benefit of focusing on one product. Maserati didn't learn this lesson. And really, they lose focus, and Ferrari does not.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so Maserati goes from building race cars and really fast cars, so now they want to develop a grand touring car. Maserati was also going to continue manufacturing machine tools. And then they wanted to make an electric truck, "thereby removing itself from direct competition with Ferrari. This alteration of direction by Maserati was the first of a series of tactical errors that would ultimately take their company out of the ranks of the elite automakers." It's all about focus. While Steve Jobs talked about this over and over again, "Focus is saying no," Maserati, run by a different person, is not able to say no. "While Ferrari was zeroing in on the tiny world of exotic cars, Maserati was doing just the opposite: expanding in a variety of directions and thereby blurring the focus of the old, much-honored firm. The decision was to reap both long and short-term benefits for Ferrari." I talked about this in the other two Ferrari podcasts as well that he would constantly limit production, made his products more lusted after, more exclusive. So at this point, they're going on for a while. They've only built 70 cars. Now they're building them by hand, like I mentioned earlier. And the people buying them, it's like the world's elite. So you have Prince this person and King this person and Emperor this person and Shah of this country and Crown Prince -- I'm just listing, reading you this list. Then you have people like the du Ponts who were one of the wealthiest American families at the time. All -- this is who he targeted first. Customers or other wealthy customers would travel all over the world just to his little factory in Maranello rather. And he'd be giving a tour and the customer is like, "I want one." And he'd have like unused unsold cars out back, and he's like, "Oh, sorry, you can't have one." He would just tell them, "No, it's going to be a year, two years." So he did this intentionally. He understood that if you tell somebody no, especially somebody who's wealthy, powerful, used to getting their way, it only makes them desire that object more. So as time goes on, he's still building the company, still focused on racing. We see his explicit goal.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Enzo Ferrari had clung to the dream of becoming what he called a grand constructor. He's like, 'I don't consider myself an industrialist. I'm a constructor.'" That's how he described himself. In addition to -- and then he was able -- he got to his goal of being a grand constructor by being an agitator of men. Those are two ideas that are linked together. "The classic manufacturer of complete racing cars and high-performance road automobiles for a select clientele of elite enthusiasts." That's what he's trying to do. "Only a few men in history had achieved such an elevated status, most prominently Bugatti and then" -- so Bugatti in Italy and Bentley in Europe -- or excuse me, in England rather. So this goes back to what's most important to a manufacturer. I told you he had a strict adherence to this schedule of his, and this is, in my opinion, some of the best writing in the book. "This man, so rooted in time and place that he never slept out of his own bed for the final 40 years of his life. His automobile business was not a means to an end. It was the end, the very essence of his being. In the final analysis, the fast cars, the Grand Prix victory, the factory itself were all secondary to what they stood for: the towering ego of the man whose name they carried, Enzo Ferrari. His personal style was an extreme contrast to the automobiles he created. They were flashy, high-styled, daring, brash, openly outrageous. He was drab, mundane, semimonastic. Ferrari remained a simple man with simple tastes. In his automobiles, there seemed to be a transference of his powerful ego and the need to express himself artistically, but in personal terms, he was muted and introverted to the point of obsession." And let's go back to what he felt what his greatest skill was and maybe the most -- the greatest skill one can possibly have if you want to build a successful organization or team, right? His greatest skill was recruiting talented people. "It is often said that his greatest skill was his ability to recognize talent. This is probably true."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I thought Ferrari had a really counterintuitive point on losing. I want to bring to your attention. So there's a writer for The New York Times, this guy named Daley, and he's spending some time with Ferrari. It says, "Daley observed that Ferrari appeared to be happier when he was losing, which jibes with the mechanics" -- the mechanics working at Ferrari, "With the mechanics' observation that the race shop on Monday was more serene following a defeat than a victory. But why?" Ferrari explained, "There is always something to learn. One never stops learning particularly when one isn't losing. When one loses, one knows what has to be done. When one wins, one is never sure." So I just want to tell you a little bit about these open-road races that they did and that caused a ton of death. This is just insane. There's a lot more detail on the book. I think this gives you a good overview. "Open-road races have long been considered too dangerous by most civilized nations and had long since been banned. But the Mille Miglia" -- again most likely mispronouncing, "Only gained in popularity among the Italian people. Estimates of the crowd that turned out to line the route soared to as high as 10 million. Thousands of police and Army regulars labored in a futile attempt to keep the mobs off the course" -- oh, my goodness, "Keep the mobs off the course, but drivers still had to be steeled to drive into packs of fans, moving, wobbling walls of flesh that would part like the Red Sea as they sped through." So do you see what's happening there? Drivers going down the road. The fans are on the road, and as the cars approach, they like part and hopefully part in time. And then some of these crazy people do stuff like this, "Children skittered across the highway and often rode their bicycles on the shoulder. Strutting young men tried to show their mettle by attempting to touch the fenders of the speeding cars." Could you imagine being so close? Do you think it's safe to be close to a car that's going at 120, 130 miles an hour? So it's like, hey, guys, let me touch the fender.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I wonder if more -- I would guess that more spectators died than drivers. It's just crazy. So I mentioned this earlier, but he just -- and there is cons to it. But Enzo had like superhuman levels of stubbornness. So it says -- and some of this is just the fact that he succeeded by just showing up. "The source of much of Ferrari's success over the years was not technological brilliance," as I mentioned earlier, "Or tactical cleverness, but dogged, gritty, unfailing persistence in competing, a willingness to appear at the line no matter what the odds and run as hard as possible." And like I said earlier, this is stubbornness to show up no matter what. Some of these races he wins by default because maybe they actually get their cars from Europe to Argentina or something like that. But the driver gets sick or there's an immigration issue or the car breaks down. And then Ferrari is there, not supposed to win the race or not expected to win the race. Guess what, I win by default. Now my greatest competitors had some unknown catastrophic event that prevented them from performing or from being able to race. And guess what, I'm here. So I'm going to do it, and I'll get the win. And obviously, you get the prize money, you get the prestige, you get everything else. It's like this virtuous, like, flywheel effect. The book also goes into detail about this whole Ford trying to buy Ferrari. Talked about that in Go Like Hell, talked about that in other places, mentioned it earlier in that clip. I just want to go to the end of it because that was funny, gives you an illustration of Enzo Ferrari the person, the fact that he's obsessed with control and he just was never going to yield that control. "Ferrari opened the conversation with a question that addressed the entire philosophy of how the new operation would be run." By this point, Ford executives had toured the factory. They're negotiating for, I think, several weeks. I don't know if -- like I said earlier, if Ferrari ever had the intention of selling. He was so proud to be an Italian. I think he just used it as leverage. What's -- the most likely -- like the thought process of -- or I guess, the description of Enzo's thought process around this time was most likely he was using this as bait for Fiat.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

If -- he was going to sell the company, but he was going to sell to an Italian company. He was not going to sell it to the Americans. So after several weeks, he opens up this conversation and he says -- it gets the entire philosophy of how the new operation would be run. "If I wish to enter cars in Indianapolis and you do not wish me to enter cars in Indianapolis, do we go? Or do we not go?" And the person from Ford leading the negotiation says, "'You do not go,' responded Frey without hesitation. Ferrari stiffened in his chair and said nothing for a moment. Then he stood up and gave Frey an icy glare. 'it was nice to know you.' Frey understood instantly that the negotiations were over. Under no circumstances would Ferrari release control of his racing operations to Ford or to anybody else for that matter." So Ferrari is notorious -- especially because so many of them were dying to -- never getting close to many of these drivers. There's a hilarious story in the book where this guy, one of these drivers wins a race. It was like the biggest race of the season, brought all kinds of attention and glory to Ferrari. And he said Ferrari never said anything to him about it. Weeks go by, and they just happened to pass each other in like the factory. And Ferrari just says two words. He says, "Hey, Champion." And the driver's like, "That's all he ever said to me about it ever." Now the indication of that also is that Ferrari, like Gen. Groves -- a couple of weeks ago when I did that book The General and The Genius or The Genius and The General -- I don't know which one came first. Gen. Groves, the guy who was leading the Manhattan Project, would not give out compliments. They're like, "Why don't you compliment people when a job is well done?" He's like, "Because it could always be done better." And I think Ferrari thought, it's like, "You won. That's what you're supposed to do. We're Ferrari." And for like a decade, right, up until they're overtaken by Ford, they -- I mean he dominates for a decade. Always he talks -- he's like, "This is expected." But anyways, earlier I was saying, you can identify, you can learn about a person by saying -- like by studying who they don't like. You can also do that by who they admire. This is what Ferrari liked about one of his drivers.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Ferrari seemed to genuinely like this moody but intensely competitive 30-year-old. Like himself, Surtees" -- I'm probably pronouncing that incorrectly, "Was self-made, a school dropout who had liked mechanics before rising" -- or excuse me, "Who learned mechanics before rising to stardom on motorcycles and then in automobiles." So again, this is what he likes. He likes the fact that this guy is moody, intensely competitive, self-made, a dropout, one who learned mechanics before rising to stardom on motorcycles and then in automobiles. "Both men were utterly single-minded when it came to racing. And unlike many of the dilettantes who had driven for the team but had never gotten their hands dirty, Surtees was prepared to work endless hours, just like Ferrari, in the dyno rooms and engine shops of the factory, seeking more power and reliability. He was a racer to his core." So I just want to bring again to your attention this monastic adherence to routine. One of -- this guy that he really liked, his name is Scaglietti. He was one of the designers that made cars like -- that's shaped like the Testarossa, the 250 GT Spyder, the California, all these other things. And so he was -- he really liked the fact that this guy was a craftsman, okay? But he had a commoner's sense of reality, which was how Ferrari thought as well. So he says, "Each Saturday, Scaglietti would receive a phone call. 'Well, Scaglietti' -- it was from Ferrari. 'Well, Scaglietti, what are you doing now?' Would be the standard question. The reply was cast in stone: he had no plans. A lunch would then be arranged. It would seem impromptu, but in fact, this same schedule was maintained for over 20 years until Ferrari's health failed in the mid-1980s." So it talks about, "They'd have this lunch every Saturday. Ferrari would lapse into recollections of his youth, repeating, hundreds of times, the story of his painful recovery in the Army hospital and the sound of the coffin nails being struck home on the floor below. The lunch would feature heavy Modenese fare, heavy cream sauces and would be amply lubricated with champagne.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This was classic Ferrari: habitual, regulated, predictable, and Modenese to the core. This was a simple man seeking simple pleasure. And he found it only within the confines of his own familiar territory." I mentioned earlier the fact that Ferrari had a very different take on things. He's just like, "If there's a race, I don't care what kind or where it's at. We're entering it." Now he can't do that. Towards the end of his career, he couldn't do that. So it says, "Part of the problem was Ferrari's insistence on being everywhere at the same time. During the period -- during this period, he was competing in Formula One, Formula Two, the Tasman series, the Can-Am, major sports-car endurance races, and all the European hill-climb championships. His engineers tried to convince Ferrari that the demands were too much. But this engineer's voice, it was a voice in the wilderness" -- meaning Ferrari just would not listen to them. I'm not entirely sure why. But when I got to this section, it reminded me of the engineer, the legendary engineer that I covered a few podcasts -- like 20 podcasts ago, Isambard Kingdom Brunel. He had a really interesting philosophy because most people are like, "Okay, if something is not working out, let me try a different attempt." Isambard Kingdom Brunel's philosophy, his first thing he would do, first way like he would try to solve a problem was to increase the dosage, not change the technique or try a different attempt. It's like, "Oh, okay, this isn't working out. I need to do 10x as much." And so that thought popped into my mind when I got to this section where this guy is like, "Oh, I'll do Formula One. I'll do Formula Two. I'll do these hill races. And I'll do endurance. I'll do short. I'll do long. It doesn't matter. I will just increase the dosage. I will do it all." And so you and I have talked about this over and over again, the fact that Enzo really had nothing else that was important to him. So the idea like, he's not going to retire. A note I wrote myself on this page is a quote from David Ogilvy. And he said, "Retirement is fatal." "Those who knew him best understood that Enzo Ferrari would never retire. There was little else in his life besides automobile racing. It was that simple." So even when he sells his company to Fiat, he still continues to work. He still has complete control of the racing aspect of the business. He lets them do the car production.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This is -- let me try and read my note. This is remarkable: selling the company to Fiat as an act of revenge. Oh, this is what I mentioned earlier. Okay. So it says, "While a tiny entity in the industrial world, his company was a giant in terms of prestige. An automobile" -- this is talking about Ferrari, the view of the brand, the power of the brand, right? Even though he's not producing -- I think he's producing 700 cars a year or something like that at this point, which is not a lot. I can't remember the exact number, but it's very small. And so it says, "He's a giant in terms of prestige, an automotive boutique more comparable to Coco Chanel or Cartier or Gucci or Christian Dior than to the industrial monolith that was Fiat. For Ferrari, it was a simple solution to capitalize his sagging business because he" -- again prestigious business, but he spends all -- every money -- every dollar he makes, he puts it back into trying to make a better race car. So he's not like -- he winds up dying wealthy, but he's not -- he doesn't make a ton of money. And the success -- like his son -- so one of his son dies, Dino. He's got like a bastard kid. And when his wife dies -- okay. So 'I'm not like -- I'm not going to sit here and talk to you about Enzo Ferrari's sex life, but the author mentions it like 50 times in the book. The guy was just obsessed with his -- during the day, he's obsessed with cars. At night, he's obsessed with sex. He's got like mistresses everywhere, all kinds of stuff. Even in his 80s, like he'll have dinners, and they go into detail in the book about like he talks about his sex life. It's really rather gross, honestly. But he winds up having a son. That son to this day, still alive, is the only heir that he leaves, owns 10% of Ferrari. And he's like a multiple billionaire -- multibillionaire, excuse me. So his son derived most of the financial benefit from Ferrari than Enzo Ferrari did in his life. I think he dies with like a network of like $30 million, something -- so it's not like he was poor by any means. But just like Walt Disney, most of the wealth came after he died.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it's saying, "For Ferrari, it was a simple solution to capitalize his sagging business. For the owner of Fiat, he was looking for status and respect. The deal was so attractive to Ferrari that he even traveled to Turin to sign the final papers, a city he had not visited in decades. It was also a measure of revenge for the old man." It gives a hint of Ferrari's mindset. So he talks about like going and sitting on the bench, the same bench that he cried when he was 18 or 19 or however old he was. Now he comes back 50 years later. He's like, "Okay, I closed this loop. I went back and closed this. I got my revenge." The process that was set in motion was to wipe out the shame of 1918 when Ferrari was not welcomed by Fiat. Surely, Enzo Ferrari had long since forgotten that as a youth, he had been rejected for employment by Fiat some 50 years earlier. Surely, he hadn't nursed that bitterness for half a century and, now in his own convoluted way, considered the account settled. Or had he? He most certainly did. Fiat received 40%, Enzo retained 49%, which would be ceded to Fiat upon his death. Piero Ferrari would get 10%. And to this day, Piero still owns 10%. I think he actually owns like 10 point -- I look it up, 10.3% or something like that. And so Enzo was also famous for never going to see his own races. And really, you could tell, he loved what he did because the stimulation was not in the result, but it was in the process. And I thought that, that was fascinating. Let me read this to you. "For the most part, he watched the contest alone" -- the races that is. "Although, one associate was occasionally invited to sit in. He recalls that Ferrari never showed emotion no matter what the fortunes of his automobiles. Ferrari simply sat there, silent and inert, never responding to either victory or defeat. His view of racing remained constant. The event itself was essentially meaningless. For him, the stimulation came in the planning and preparation, in the creation of the machines, in the organization of the human beings who would man the team. He was obsessed with the process. He was in love with the organization, the creation of the cars, not the outcome of the race.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Of course, he wants to win the race. But I think that's a really good sign that you're obsessed with the actual journey. That's an interesting idea I hope I remember. So like I said earlier, Enzo does this until he dies. There's a great story in the book that is pure Enzo. This is right before he dies. Chinetti goes and visits him. Enzo's mind is still sharp, but his body is betraying him. And they go and they wind up -- this is the last time they ever meet. And Chinetti says, "May I embrace you?" "In silence, Enzo Ferrari opened his arms, and the two men hugged, groping perhaps for the life that was slipping away from them. There was a brief display of tears, quickly dabbed and then business began. They discussed an old Ferrari Formula Two car. Chinetti agreed to lend the automobile to the proposed Ferrari Museum. He was well aware of the feeding frenzy of Ferrari collectors around the world that had made the car in question worth more than $1 million." So the car is worth $1 million. Chinetti is like, "No, you know what, I'll give it to you. I'll donate it to your Ferrari Museum, but you have to do the following." And so it says, "But for his old friend, he proposed a deal: $40,000 donated to four charities, including the poor children of Maranello. Ferrari balked. He would pay no more than $30,000, not a penny more. Chinetti could not help but be amused. Here was this man, 90 years old, mortally wounded by the passage of time yet still able, yes, eager to haggle over a few dollars. 'The old rascal, worth at least $40 million,' Chinetti reckoned, 'Intending to go to his reward with his last lira.' The deal, always the deal. It was classic Ferrari.

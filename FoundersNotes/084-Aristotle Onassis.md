Now it gets even worse. Some people were sent off to concentration camps in the interior of the island. Few were more even gruesome, and this is -- I can't pronounce the name, but this is his aunt, so Socrates Onassis' sister and her husband, right? So that's -- that would be Aristotle's aunt and his child, which would be his niece, had sought sanctuary in a church. They're in a little Greektown a little ways away. 500 Greek men, women and children were held together in prayer when the Turk set the church on fire, every last man, woman, and child perish in the flame. So he's already lost, let's say, half a dozen family members and the war just began, they're dead immediately. Socrates Onassis says that his dad was arrested in lodge and prison. Now what he thinks is going to happen to him. Aristotle was filled with a nagging fear for his father's health and life. There was little he could do at the moment. He was now the only man in the family, and he was racking his brains for a way to cope with his new responsibilities. Aristotle was left on his own. He did not know where he would spend the night because it came and it would kick them out of the house and they started putting the Turkish soldiers into the house as previously occupied by not only Onassis' family, but everybody in the neighborhood. So now this is where he figures -- he starts acting almost entrepreneurial, right? The Turks wanted alcohol. They were the central command. I don't know what their version of, but let's say, in an American army, be like the general forbade, the Turkish soldiers to drink, right? So the Turkish soldiers wanted to get around that, they wanted alcohol. And Aristotle is like, well, if I can figure out, and it was really hard to get at the time. If I can figure out how to get it, I can ingratiate myself with them and maybe like I can show that I'm useful: one, they'll let me live; and two, I may be able to rescue my father, okay?

Immediately after the war, a tanker, which cost the government about $2.5 million to build during the war and having given good war service, fetch as much as $4 million, okay? So what he's going to trace here is that the price of the underlying assets in the shipping industry go up and down based on if you can make money with those assets, right, like anything else. So you're buying a used thing they pay $2.5 million. They got good service out of war and they're going to sell to you for $4 million. By 1947, with a few years behind it, it could be sold for $2 million. Now it's down to half price, right, almost the original cost. One year later, the price was down to $1 million, another year and the value was up to $3 million. So $2.5 million, up to 4, down to $2 million down to $1 million, back up to $3 million. This is a very short amount of time. You could see if you're buying at the right time, you're going to make a lot of money. You buy on the other end, you're destroy it. By 1954, though they were now 14 years old, they're valued humbled to $400,000. But with the Suez Crisis, what you're talking about there is Suez Crisis has to do with Suez Canal. It's also known as like the second Arabian Israeli war, having the 50s, close down the Canal, it causes a huge boom for the shipping and strain because now everybody is worried about oil transportation and so all the prices go up, which I'll get to there in a minute. So I just -- in case you haven't heard that before, I think it's rather famous, but anyways. But with the Suez Crisis 1956, all these tankers going up to a fantastic $4.5 million. So let's say, $4.5 million from $400,000. So almost 10x, a little over 10x even though they're getting older, right? And on the other side of this boom comes a depression, come 1958, 1959, and they were down a rock bottom of $200,000. So think about the volatility of this asset I'm describing to you. Before they fulfill their 20-year lifespan, they were once more worth $400,000 each.

He thinks in terms of acceleration of progress and has achieved it. Only as quiet authority suggests that this is the same man who has, for years, figured in the headlines of English, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, and American newspapers; Predictable labels attached to unpredictable stories, describing him as the Mystery Millionaire, the merchant adventurer, the Golden Greek. About his multimillion-dollar deals, real or imagined, financial writers never see speculating. However, fascinating the true facts of his life, Inventive Minds, keep developing new permutations to title the imagination with artificial ingredients. Onassis is not an officer of any corporation, domestic or foreign, but an owner holding stocks of corporations, which give him control. Control over interest worth an estimated $500 million. This is the insurance value of its fleet, but the figure is liable to change from month to month. And Onassis himself can sometimes only estimate the exact total. It is not easy. The total is made up of some 85 companies in 10 or more countries, which are apart from owning assorted real estate and considerable subsidiary properties and enterprises operate all the tankers under the Onassis flag and employ a huge labor force, which serves Onassis interest on land and sea and in the air. At any one time, several projects in the pipeline demand achieves personal attention. The new supertankers under construction, new air travel techniques under exploration, new financial ideas require constant study of economic trends, political developments, legal contingencies, and business practices, which vary from country to country. Sailors are said to have a girl in every port. Shipowners and airline operators have a problem on every seaboard.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. So that's in the beginning of the book that I read this week, the one that I'm going to talk to you about today, which is just named Onassis. It's by Willie Frischauer. I don't know how to pronounce his last name, and it says it's the definitive biography, the fascinating life of this awesome figure whose wealth and power have made him a legend, including the dramatic story of his marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy. And this book before I jump into the rest of the book, it's actually recommended and sent to me, the link was sent to me by a listener who actually ordered the original version. So I have holding in my hand is the first version printed in 1968, and it smells like it's from 1968 too. What I find fascinating, if you follow Founders podcast on Twitter, I talked about it this week, but in the upper right-hand corner, it has the original price, and it says the original price was $0.95. So I decided to start with that section of the book because I think it gives you a good overview of the chaos, maybe the controlled chaos in which he operated. And I think the way his businesses restructured this perpetual chaos has something to do with the chaos of war that he experienced as a very young person. So I'm going to spend a lot of time talking about that today because I found it very fascinating. We're going to see traits as of young Onassis navigates the perils of war, traits that I feel like the way he thought and the way he navigated that situation is very entrepreneurial in nature. But first, I just want to start with some personality and then his M.O., his modus operandi. And it says, unlike other tycoons, he dislikes an entourage. He says it's undignified for people to be kept hanging around waiting for command. And invariably, he travels alone and without luggage. He has suits, shirts, shoes, waiting for him wherever he goes. So just talks about his -- he's going to give you an idea of his chaotic travel. He's got, like they said, 85-plus different companies in almost -- I think on every single continent, actually. So just talks about he pulls up on his yachts in New York. And then it says London assumes that Onassis is about to take off from Paris to New York. No one who's on this end, New York says his New York office, but he turns up in London instead. He was kind of just like a specter just traveling the globe constantly. No one knew where it's going.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I think he did that intentionally. While a car waits to take them from -- to the airport, a telephone conversation changes his plan. So he moves extremely. I think one of the things right after rip that you're going to learn from Onassis is the value of speed. This guy was really, really fast. Blackouts and his movements are accidental rather than deliberate. But if he's pressed too hard about definitive dates and places, he is liable to plead, please do not pin me down. So the only thing I could say, he talk about that a lot in this book. And I think something I learned from him is the value and always focusing on the most valuable thing you could be doing at that time. So we didn't have a strict schedule. He just said, what's the most important problem I need to solve, and he dedicate that. And then you move on to hey, what's the next problem. And inevitably, different problems would pop-up constantly because he has such a wide and chaotic organization. Let use that word a lot, I think, today. And so he's not like, "Oh, I know I'm going to be next to us". It's like, it depends on what's the most important -- what's the most important way I could spend my time. And I think that is something that we can all apply as well. He says, he knows every inch of the way. So he's talking about -- right now, we find him in his home on islands of Greece or one of his homes. And he says, this canal he explains, everything Greek launches him on a historical, geographical, ethnographical lecture and dispersed with items of topography and mythology. And he talked about this canal was originally built for Alexander the Great. I put that part in the because he's constantly learning. And so this serves him later in life because he studied a lot of history, studies a lot of like political history, military history. And then he keeps an eye on what's going on. Obviously, his business was built in shipping, which is hugely affected as we've seen with the other entrepreneurs that we've covered that operating shipping. So I guess I should back up before I get there. If you remember the podcast I did on The Invisible Billionaire, Daniel K. Ludwig. In that book, he's also mentioned in this book interesting enough. So that's another example of this whole idea of books at original links. But in that book, he talks a lot about is competition with Aristotle Onassis.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then this other Greek, which is actually Onassis's brother-in-law. And good luck, if I'm pronouncing his name correctly, it's Stavros. I don't even know how to -- I can barely pronounce words in English. Just no, I'm going to take -- and there's no way I am going to pronounce the names in Greek. But in any event, in the Ludwig book, named The Invisible Billionaire talks about -- Onassis, talks about Stavros. And then in this book, it also goes into both a little bit of Daniel K. and a little bit -- a lot of his rivalry - his bitter rivalry with his brother-in-law, which I'll cover more in a minute. It's very bizarre because they're both -- they hate each other, but they're married to sisters. So it's bizarre. Anyway, the whole point about him knowing history winds up, I couldn't understand because the book kept referencing Churchill. It talks about how he was obsessed with Churchill; he had all the books written about Churchill. It ends up being really good friends. And this is like an anomaly, I don't know how to pronounce the word either. In this book is his relationship is a very close relationship in the last few years that Churchill was alive, which I'll also talk about.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Actually, I'll just read this part to you real quick because we're in -- the book starts out talking about how he is in present day. He's around 60 years old when this book is written and Churchill is like 80, I think, 80, maybe 79, something like that. So he says he's playing host to Sir Winston Churchill. That's why I was after several pages like why he talked about Churchill. It turned out the day 1 become really good friends who's enjoying his nautical holiday, he's on Onassis's private yacht. It's one of the largest yachts in the world called the Christina, which is named after Onassis' daughter. And he says, I love to see a deep sense of history, admiration reciprocated by paternal affection unites these 2 men of vastly different backgrounds. Adding a curious footnote to the glorious story of Churchills life. So I just think, in general, that it's beneficial not only to your life to learn and study from history. But in conversation, you just become much more interesting to talk to. And because Onassis and Churchill both had a deep love of history and was a primary hobby of their studying it, they were able to build a bond later in life. Interesting enough, the author here, Willy, goes into details of what Churchill's schedule was later in life because he spent a lot of time on Onassis' yacht. And I'm just going to take a quick tangent here, but he'd have breakfast at 9 a.m., and he'd finished breakfast with a glass of whiskey, which I thought was hilarious and then he'd read, he wouldn't leave bed. So he had breakfast in bed and then he'd read 200 pages. That's the first thing he did every day. He'd read 200 pages, mostly of history, politics, stuff that he was interested in. And then he goes out and get his stay started. So I thought this was very fascinating. All right. So I want to spend a lot of time in Onassis early life. A lot of -- we've talked about this before; a lot of these entrepreneurs have to overcome some form of adversity early in life. I don't know if any have had to overcome more adversity than Onassis. And so that's why I want to spend some time talking to you about this. First, we're going to talk about is Dad, they have great names, by the way. I mean his name is Aristotle. How great is that? His dad was Socrates. So we're going to talk about that here first. He said Socrates Onassis was by now an established merchant dealing mainly at tobacco, but also in grain and hides and offering his customers from the surrounding countryside, storage, and banking facilities of sorts. So they're in -- they live in this place called Smyrna, which, based on this other research I did was that, I guess, it's now modern-day Turkey, and they're going to get caught in the -- I think it's the Greco-Turkish War. So this is a little background of how their life was right before this war, which is going to come in and devastate his family.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So a lot of people are going to die, and he's got a fleet of the country. So Socrates at age 26, met Penelope -- that's when Onassis' mom and Penelope died. So at the age of 26, Penelope died as a result of a kidney operation. Aristotle was only 6. So this is before the war, he loses his mom. This is all the first tragic event in his life, one of many. Aristotle Onassis says that he was brought up by his grandmother remember his grandmother because she is going to fall tragedy as well. Aristotle was a quiet sad little boy who solely missed his mother. Okay. So his father was a merchant, an entrepreneur, another word for that. And he wanted to teach him business, a young Aristotle business. But interesting enough, Aristotle wasn't interested yet. Aristotle's only inclination at this time ran towards sports. He sailed road, swam and played water polo. And so Socrates is talking to his son, he says, what are you going to be, a fisherman or a boatman because remember, they're Greeks so their -- that's their, like their occupation, their expected occupations, I should say. He has something to do with the sea. Neither was an occupation worthy of Aristotle, he said, which turns out -- he changes his mind obviously. He was a 14 when he was in line for a place in the Greek National Water Polo team to compete in the Olympic games. So he's focused on sports at this time. It was a great honor, but his father put his foot down. The expedition would interfere with the boy's studies he said, and he would not allow him to go. So another disappointment. It was huge disappointment, but his father's stern regime paid dividends. In spite of his preoccupation with sport, Aristotle - they call them Aristotle, I'm going to call him Aristotle, made good progress at school. His quick grasp and his extraordinary memory made up for time spent in other pursuits. He learned to speak English and soon knew enough, French, and Italian. I think he winds up -- so he knows English, French, Italian, Greek, and I think one of their languages as well. Okay. So he's a teenager at this time. He hasn't had a mom for almost 10 years, and this is the start of the Greco-Turkish war.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And this is going to come right to his front door literally. So it says Turkish progress was so rapid, meaning they're invading where he lives, that any planes Onassis brothers, meaning his dad and his dad's family made for the future, we're quickly overtaken by events. Socrates gathered his family around him and his house by the sea. Aristotle Onassis was still 4 months away from a 17th birthday, and he went to sleep knowing that this was the last day of his use. So what they're talking about there is you can see the Turkish ships in the harbor right by their house and they're going to invade the very next day. Aristotle awoke to the thunder of guns. Aristotle and his father had the -- their first inkling of disaster when looking out from behind the curtains, they could see the city being swallowed up in thick dark smoke. But what registered most in Aristotle's mind was a father somber face and the despair in his eyes. The Socrates remember, a lot of times like you're not going to reach your full potential unless you're in many cases, you're forced to, and this is -- this is an early example of that in Aristotle's life because 16 years old is like, okay, there's no more time to be a boy. I now have to grow up, and I have to take care of my family. Not only does he had to take of families, that's the secondary, he has to make sure he survives first. So a ton of people that they know are going to get killed right now. Through Socrates Onassis did not speak Aristotle could sense his deep anxiety, family and property were in danger. You could say that again. The business he had built up over the years was liable to be wiped out. His father appeared to weaken, and Aristotle seemed to gain strength and maturity.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He had reached a stage when he was -- now this is interesting. So his father wanted him, member, he wanted him to be in business, but he also wanted him to be an educated person, so he want him to go -- sent them to school at Oxford in England. And so he had to reach a stage when he was fully qualified to enter Oxford. This is his father's Deer's wish. However, better the thought he realized that this dream had vanished. Never mind father, he said, if we survive, I'll you'll find a job and help keep the family going. He did not know it then, but this is exactly what would happen. And so now the war breaks out and people are being killed right in front of him. He said, Aristotle saw men being dragged on their homes and taken away many were put up against the wall and shot and got blood. Remember, he's 16 years old. So while I'm telling you the story, think about what you were doing when you were 16 and imagine having to go through this. Others were hanged from trees. He's literally in a warzone and lampposts. Grown men were begging for their lives. Women were screaming for help, children watching too numb to cry. So he talks about this river by their house, floating in the water could be seeing clusters of severed heads of young Greek girls tied together by their hair like a bunch of coconuts. Fate was even more gruesome. Now this is -- I had a hard time reading this part. So some of them stay in the city they're in. Some of them try to run. His uncle who's involved in politics tries to run 40 miles away. He gets caught and they, think about if you've ever studied any kind of what happens in war like when they say they tried by the military court, this is not like what you may be used as like, oh, okay, 4 months from now, I'll have a trial and maybe I'll be sentenced 6 months after that. Now the trials happening really fast. They're found guilty of course because it's invading army and they're hung right away. So that happens to his uncle, his dad's brother's dead.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So what happens is he meets the Turkish soldiers, you want alcohol, I can get it, don't worry about it. So he goes around with the Turkish soldier, and he goes to all the other people he knew because he was from a rather prominent family and on the island, he lived on. And all of them like, no, I don't have alcohol, I don't have alcohol. And he didn't understand because you look -- they were staring at Aristotle like they weren't verbalizing it, but their body language and their eye contact was like, what are you doing? Like what are you doing? And you realized, "Oh, they're not going to help me when I have this Turkish soldier here". So he goes back later on by himself, explains what he's trying to do to family friends and they finally give him some alcohol, even though it's extremely valuable at the time. They make it themselves and they were hiding it. So then he goes and gives it to the Turkish soldiers. He starts getting like a pass. They get them like paperwork that in case you stop by soldier, it means like don't kill him. They're like, he's okay to be on the streets. He says the transaction was not only early evidence of Aristotle's native talent for dealing with intricate problems of supply and demand under adverse circumstances. What matter most at this time was this acquisition of a second protector, so this is in addition to the paperwork he has from the Turkish Army. He makes friends with this U.S. Vice Console. So it's an American part of the allied forces in the embassy there that basically starts looking after him. He says this prison among Greeks and Smyrna in 1922. Each of his Garden Angels, both the American and the Turkish gave him it's called laissez-passer, bearing his name in photograph. The Turkish pass enabled him to move freely about the city, even more important the American permit, allowed him to access the U.S. Marine zone. That's important to remember that because that's how he's going to wind up escaping. Obviously he survives this, we know he survives this. Okay. So during this whole time, he's trying to -- he visits his dad, trying to get him out of there. And then his dad is being held and they don't know what's going to happen. And then one time, he goes to visit to dad and his dad say, like, listen, they take people away every morning and then we never see them again, what the hell is happening. Well, you probably guess what they're doing. They're killing them.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And this -- they realized this was actually true and verified because one guy they take away is like 45 years old at that time. They put him in front of a judge, judge says, okay, you're guilty, you're going to hang them. They put the rope on his neck. And they're like, the guy you're looking for 20 years old, I don't look 20, you have this wrong. So the judge looks at the paperwork like, "Oh, c_*_, this guy, right. We're looking for 20-year-old -- there's no way this guy is 20. So take them back to the cell." He goes back to the cell and tells everybody, "Hey, if they take you away, they're going to kill you". So eventually, eventually Aristotle is able to -- I guess would be the right way. He was able to -- he's able to visit the jail or his father and other people and his family and friends are being held, and he's able to go back and forth. So he's sneaking in money for them, so they can pay out the guards. He's sneaking out communications. He ends up getting caught doing this, though, right? So he has -- they're like, "Oh, this guy like now it doesn't matter that you have this pass, you're going to be in jail". And so he winds up going for a walk with soldiers to transport them from one part to another. And he winds up the soldier wasn't paying attention. He falls back a little bit and runs full speed to the U.S. military zone. And they're -- like he says he runs as fast as he can, nonstop for like 15 minutes, he gets there. So now he's in the U.S. Marine zone, and he meets the console. This guy's named console Parker, is how they referenced him in the book. But -- so he goes to the office, he hides in -- the console hides Aristotle in the office. But the Turk Army shows up and they're like, "We know you have this guy." And the console says like, "No, we don't." Well, the Turkish aren't going to have -- they're not going to start a war with Americans. So he says the Turks were unconvinced but there was nothing they could do. They did not dare search the counsel's office. As soon as they were gone, Parker released Aristotle, he produced an American sailors uniform. So this is how he's going to get out, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Produced an American sailor's uniform for the youngest to put on, took them to the harbor and put them on a board to U.S. destroyer. So he's able to escape the war zone with his life because of this one guy and he escapes aboard, a U.S. destroyer. Now this is the interesting part. So before he got caught smuggling all the stuff from -- by the Turkish military, he winds up going to the family, save taking out some money. I think it was like $20,000 to $40,000 and basically paying for his father's, like bribing to get is father released, right? But the family is mad, and Aristotle is humiliated, and this is when he started seeking freedom, and then this is where he says, looking back on his life, that ambition is born because this is very much the book I'm working from is very much like an autobiography of Aristotle because he's working. He's the one talking to Willie and Willie Frischauer, whatever how to pronounce his name is getting a lot of information from Aristotle. He is doing this because like in many cases, when you reach an advanced stage, you want to start telling your story and making sure it's documented. But what I could -- I just couldn't imagine -- I'm going to read this to you, but they're mad because they're like, "Oh, well, you gave them $25,000. We needed that money because we've lost everything, but your father and your uncle were going to be acquitted anyways." But he says like you didn't know that, though. It was just really silliness from this perspective. So it says at our family conference, he had asked Aristotle to give an accounting of the cash and securities he had salvage and full details of its expenditures.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This is after this dad was released. The largest item in the transactions for which young Aristotle was responsible was the -- I'm going to just convert to dollars here. $25,000, he had paid for his father's release. Both his father and uncle, Uncle Homer, more great Greek names, right, thought in an exorbitant and totally unnecessary outlay because they contended Socrates Onassis had already been acquitted and would have been released in any case. But again, why you -- they were killing people left and right. I would -- I'd buy some insurance. It's okay if I spend that money. Aristotle was very upset, never before he felt so humiliated and never ever after. The injury to his pride produces a typical reaction. And later, he said that the anger and frustration of this period of his life gave birth to the ambition and drive, which later took them to the top. He was anxious to get away and took the traditional Greek way out. I shall keep no more than -- this is a direct quote from Aristotle to his father. I should keep no more than $250 of what's left and I'll immigrate. His anglers were coupled with an urge toward adventure. Above all, he wanted to remain his own master. Remember, we talk about this like motivation, why do so many people -- where are so many people interested in entrepreneurship also like so weird. Why they are misfits to use Steve Jobs term? Like why, why? What is -- why is this such an overlap there? And I think a lot of it has to do with the feeling of control of your own life. And it's hard to have control of your own life if you don't control how you make money in the world. And as a result of that, also how you spend time -- how you spend your time. And since most of your -- half of your waiting time, essentially, he is going to be spent on work. If you want to control over your time, then that means you learn how to become an entrepreneur, which is we are watching and I guess, listening would be a better term of Aristotle learn how to do that right now. He wanted to remain his own master as he had been in those past few months, memories by himself, nobody around, and he just has to survive. He wanted to stand on his own 2 feet and prove himself. Once the decision was made, he lost no time. So there's a speed. He takes a long time contemplating, kind of like who Charlie Munger describes the process at Berkshire Hathaway, that a lot of the time has been learning, learning, analyzing, analyzing, thinking, thinking, you would look at them, think they're doing nothing. And yet when they have an opportunity before them, they make a decision really, really fast and move on immediately.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Aristotle, as far as I can tell from this book, was the same way. Okay. So he's headed to Argentina, which is he actually becomes a nationalized citizen of Argentina. And on his journey to Argentina, he learned something that's very, very valuable. And let me look, I don't want to mess this up. So let me pull up this quote. It's one of the most famous Steve Jobs quotes. And okay, here it is. I'm going to read this to you, real quick -- when you -- this is Steve Jobs talking. When you grow up, you get told that the world is the way it is and your job is to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, have a nice family life, save a little money, but that is a very limited life. Life can be much broader when you discover one simple fact, everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. You can change it. You can influence it. You can build things that other people can use. You can poke life, and something will pop out of the other side. So what is Steve Jobs telling us? He's telling us that life is malleable and most people think it's just rigid. So I was born here. This is what I have to do. Okay, I'm going to go to tell me to go to school. I'm going to go to school, I'm going to go to get a job. We'll get married and we are just going to wait till we die. Steve Jobs like, no, that's the wrong thing. You can change, you can mold it. That is maybe the most important thing, meaning the most important thing to realize because it affects everything else is very like meta skill, right? To shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you're just going to live in it, embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark on it. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again. The reason I bring that up is because in this section of the book when he's on this boat, has no money, no family. He's by himself. He's still a kid. He's a kid.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He realizes that everything is malleable, okay? So he's poor. He's in like what they call the steerage passengers. And he's basically like in the -- like in the whole of the ship, and it said steerage passengers received one meal a day. They either standing up or squatting on the floor. Space was cramped, the smell appalling. You can imagine why this smells so bad. I'll let you fill that in, and some will kind of related to this next sentence, sanitary conditions were primitive. So Onassis in this, what does he do? He realizes they're like, well, if you pay another $20, you could transfer to a cabin where you share with 6 other people, but like you're not in the whole, right? And you didn't have the $20. So he says the alternative was a personal approach to the purser, which is this guy running the section they're in, which is the course he chose. Reinforcing his plea with a $5 bill, meaning a bribe. He sweet-talked as he puts it and somehow persuaded the person to let them stay in the half part of the ship. So he's realizing, okay, like these are the guidelines they're giving everybody else. Everybody -- the vast majority of the people in the ship are not thinking like entrepreneurs, right? They're like, "Oh, okay, well, that's it". I have to stay down here. And if I want somewhere else, I have to pay $20. Entrepreneurs realized what Steve Jobs has told us. They wanted the most important things that you need to learn in your life, and you'll never be the same once you internalize this. Everything is malleable. You can manipulate life, you can poke it, something will change. Your actions have an effect. And so young Aristotle realize like, okay, well, people like, it's not rigid, it's I have to convince one person and people are like they're prone to change their mind. They will respond to like personal request if you do it in a right way. Here, let me be really nice to the guys, we talk them and give a little money. And then maybe it's not guarantee to work, but it increases my chances of working and it went up working for him. So he arrived in Argentina, has no money. He -- this is his first job.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It's, I'd say, offered him a job at a wage of $0.25 an hour. Remember, this guy winds up being -- I treated a section from the book this week. He winds up -- his company is all combined, let's say, 30 years from where we are in this story. He's starting out $0.25 an hour and eventually, he makes about $50 million a year. We're going to see the same traits that make you successful when you have a large company are the same traits that make you successful when you're just starting out and he says, "It was this first ever job and he attacked it with Gusto". He was asked by the manager whether they would be willing to work overtime. Aristotle Onassis was not sure what this implied. His boss was working at this place called Western Electric by the way, it has like a telephone exchange which is very like manual back in the day. His boss explained that anyone prepared to work after 5:00 would be paid time and half. Aristotle promptly volunteered. And so they asked how many hours will you work? And he says, hours, Aristotle reply was all night. At this rate of pay, he was prepared to work 24 hours a day with one stroke. "He and his friends were rich". He now earned 3x the amount he needed to pay his way. So what he figured out is like these are my monthly expenses. And so I need to make sure I hit this every month. Eventually, rather quickly, he winds up for every month, he works his way. He buys 3 more months of expenses. And this was just more examples of his resourcefulness, greater subscription of entrepreneurs. I think comes from Paul Graham. He says Paul Graham he says they're relentlessly resourceful, and Aristotle definitely fits into that. He says another suggestion for young Onassis, would you care to become a telephone operator. Aristotle was all forward and involved only a few days training, he learned quickly and soon he had mastered the mechanics. The weeks later, he saw another chance to better himself. So again, realizing I just need to get -- I'm on one vine. I need to swing to the next, right? I'm not going to like go to ine I'm on till I know I can grab the other one, but I'm keep waking my way up and keep focused on progress. So he starts out $0.25 an hour, then he does time and a half. Then he becomes a telephone operator and now 3 weeks later, saw another chance to better himself. Would you mind switching to night work, his boss asked him. He starts getting more money because he's working overnight. And then what happens, he realizes, well, if I'm working overnight, I don't need my bed, I can ramp my bet out. This is what he liked about nightwork. It left him to his days free to explore, new avenues of advancements.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Remember, he's focused on advancing. He sublet his bed to a fellow Greek who slept in it while he was on night shifts. So he will run a lot of other poor people realizing, hey, most people they want an apartment or a place to live just because they have a place to sleep at night. So I'm going to give this guy my bed for cheaper and hinging an apartment since -- and it's just added money to me because I'm working. He made a study of local -- this is his first business, he ends up manufacturing cigarettes interesting enough, actually importing tobacco. What he does here is really, really smart. He made a study of local cigarette manufacturers who might become his customers. I should back up his father. He fell out with his father. He wind up two telegrams and letters. They went up repairing their relationship and he's like, "Hey, dad, you can import tobacco, why don't you send me some and then I sell it, I mark it up and sell it to the Argentinians". So he said he made a sort of local cigarette manufacturers who might become his customers. And with his first consignment set on a tour of their purchase departments. Although he tried hard, he did not gear very far with his new venture. At best, he was asked to leave his samples behind and await a decision. He left dozens of samples, but never heard from any of the buyers. There was no point in banging his head against a brick wall, okay. So before I continue, there's 2 examples. This is the first one. Probably the most important thing you're going to learn from Aristotle Onassis is the same way I use another Charlie Munger quote, invert always invert and that when you have a problem to solve, which is basically what running a business is, you -- it makes sense in Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett's advice and then we're going to see this in Aristotle Onassis' actions is to start at the problem and work backwards. Most people don't do that. Most people are doing what he did.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Oh, I need to sell tobacco, let me go knock on some doors, but he's not getting anywhere that way. So this is the first example. And then I'm going to tell you the second example, which is what arguably -- no, not even arguably, what created all of his vast wealth, which is still probably 15 years from this time, but is a small example of that. So the note I left myself was Aristotle's unusual, but effective sales technique used to break into the tobacco industry. He decided that obviously the most -- the better approach was to start at the top. This is what he does, check this out. This is very, very smart. Remember, you're going -- they're saying, "Okay, yes, I leave some samples, and you'll hear back". They don't give a c_*_ about them. They don't ever hear back. So you say, "Oh, I got to find a different way in." Choosing the firm, which seemed to offer the best chance of a sale, he made it his business to track down the Managing Director, okay? So the boss of the people that he was originally paying sales cost to you. This guy named Juan. Juan became a young tobacco salesman's principal target. Early mornings, he posted himself at the entrance of Juan's office, standing there without saying a word looking at the comms I'm just going to keep call him Juan. Looking at Juan when he arrived and incidentally looking rather sorry for himself. On alternate days, he transferred his lonely visual to the important man's home, taking a position as a door. So he's just basically stocking this guy at his home and his office. Wherever the helpless Juan went, Aristotle Onassis was waiting for him, a sad and silent youngster. After fourth night of this exercise, Juan would not have been human had you not begun to wonder what it was, what this was all about. If it was a battle of perseverance between 2 unlikely protagonists, Aristotle Onassis has marched as the clear winner. His strange sales campaign was about to enter the third week when Juan could no longer restrain his curiosity and confronted his silent pursuer. Who are you, he asked in a tone of mixed sympathy and exacerbation? What are you doing here? What do you want? I'm trying to sell tobacco was a simple answer. Aristotle complained that he had not been given a fair chance. The tobacco he had to offer was of excellent quality, Juan was amused. You ought to go to my purchasing department. He told Onassis.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Remember, that's where Onassis has been. He had already tried this, but just changing the -- just inverting makes all the difference in the world. We're going to see that here. This was all the unorthodox tobacco salesman wanted to hear. It was one thing to call in a buyer of its own, but an entirely different matter to be in a position to say that he has been sent by the Managing Director, same exact thing, one sentence changes everything. The next morning, when he presented himself at the purchasing department on the authority of the boss, his samples were carefully examined and found to justify all the claim of his tobacco. He received an order worth $10,000, check that out. He's making -- I guess I'd make a lit bit more than that but $0.25 an hour. He started at $0.25 an hour. This is like a year later. He got an order worth $10,000. That's insane. The tobacco arrived 2 months later, his reward, remember, he's just a salesperson. He said he's busy broker in this situation, right, was the usual 5% commission, the magnificent sum of $500. The first money Aristotle Onassis had earned other than a wage per hour. All right. So he made $500. If you do the math, that's at $0.25 an hour, that's 2,000 hours. It's basically an entire year's worth of salary working full time. So right there, you have an entrepreneur that's born. He was already worth a few thousand dollars, but was far too cautious, is another he is frugal, at least at the beginning was life it was -- we as far too cautious to give up his bread-and-butter job at the telephone exchange or leave his boarding house for more luxurious quarter.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So in other words, he was making money, but he was acting. He was keeping the burn rate low, his personal burn rate low, and he was just saving, saving, saving money because he realizes you're not going to get ahead in life if you spend every dollar you have. So then he's now -- he's still working -- so he does this for quite a while. He works at the telephone company and is brokering tobacco sales; then he branches often does another business. And he decides, "Hey, I could take tobacco and I can hire cigarette rollers because they were doing it by hand at this time, and he starts adding, I think, like different ingredients, like rosemary and stuff like that. And his idea is I'm going to make cigarettes targeted at women. And so it starts out successful when you really had like a tiny, tiny office, tiny, tiny manufacturing center with 2 people doing this, he ends up growing too fast and it winds up failing. So he was employing 30 men in his small factory, but there were no profits rather than go broke, he swallowed this pride and closed the place. The failure of his first independent venture was a bitter pill to swallow. I actually think that was a really good idea because he's making a lot of money importing and selling tobacco. So if you're losing money, like you're taking time away. When he gets older, he's got a lot of help. People can run as companies and everything else. But right now, he's doing a lot of it himself. So closing down was a smart move. And this is -- I'm going to fast-forward a few years, this is Aristotle 23 years old. It says Aristotle Onassis -- I don't know what that word is, but it means summed up or added up the profits of the first 4 years in business. From the modest beginning of $10,000 order for tobacco, he'd gone on to average a turnover of about a best $0.25 million a year. In these 4 years, the total profit from commissions, which came to the precocious 23-year-old businessmen amounted to $1 million. So he made $1 million by the time he was as 23. He was desperately anxious to learn, but he didn't rest on his laurels, right? I told you at the beginning that he was constantly learning, constantly studying, constantly trying to get better, he's focused on progress all the time.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This is the same thing. He needs more skills. He was desperately anxious to learn, employed -- he employed a teacher to improve his French and Spanish, and you took English lessons was another. He was ambitious, acquisitive, conscious of his own talent and increasingly fascinated by the creative possibilities of big business. Okay. Now I just want to point your attention to this one sentence. So he's very successful. His dad has health problems. He visits, goes back, and visits his family. And he picks up on something. This one sentence, I think, the not myself as stressors help you grow. I think it's the worst idea for entrepreneurs are people who are interested in doing anything out of the norm, not just for entrepreneurs. I just use entrepreneurs because all of the entrepreneurs I study, all put themselves either voluntarily and in many cases, involuntarily, in stressful situations. Stressors help you grow. Now not chronic stress, but I think it's the worst idea for people to seek comfort. It's a bad idea because you're not -- there's no growth. There's no advancement. There's no reaching your potential when you're comfortable. And I think that applies to your work, your physical fitness, your relationships, anything. So he said something here that I think is really interesting. He says at a very young age, he's talking about like he was supporting his family, sending money back. He had pay for younger people, younger family members' education. And he's still a young kid. He's in his 20s now, but he says something. He says, at a very young age, I had the responsibilities of a chief of a tribe, meaning that either -- you have 2 opportunities, you're going to shrink from the situation you're in and fail and let everybody down or you're going to push forward and develop the skills needed to succeed.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And that's what he did. And he maybe think of this treatise all this week by the science account. And this account name is Massimo. But it says, when scientists started biosphere, they're making lines biosphere I don't tell you. When scientists started biosphere 2 projects in 1991, they could not understand why trees fell over before they matured. So they're in this dome, they're hidden from the natural stress of life. That's how I want you to think about this, right? They later figured out they suffered from weakness caused by a lack of stress normally created in response to wins in natural condition. So the wins, right, the strength of the wins from treatise like of stress experience at a young age makes them stronger, deprived of that stress and they fall over. People are the exact same. So don't seek comfort. Onassis -- I mean, there's no description of his early life that you would say is comfortable. Even when I tell you about the pace of his -- that he lived life at, like luxury is around them. Of course, he's super wealthy, but he pushed the pace. He was not like resting on his laurels. He was not sitting in comfort. Okay. So remember, he starts out, he builds his first small fortune in the tobacco industry. But he -- this is when he starts thinking about the shipping industry. And this is -- well, this is how Aristotle thought about a shipping industry, has thought about the shipping industry. So he's living in Buenos Aires, the foreign minister summoned him. He wanted to be becoming what's called a consulate, so let me just read this. It was really at this moment he assumed office as console that a ship owner was born. So he's got to basically almost like, I guess, it's a political appointment or diplomatic duty is what they call it, between Greece and Argentina. So his first day is as the consulate coincided with the beginning of the world economic crisis and shipping being a barometer of economic conditions was badly affected, so more stress. And what they're talking about here, we're at the beginning of the worldwide Great Depression. So he has to -- he's basically responsible for the relationship because at this time, Greece is sending a lot of exports to Argentina, how do they get them there at this time? Of course, it's through shipping.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this is how he's exposed to the shipping industry. Kind of have in front of very beginning. He has to deal with stuff like crude disputes, complex report authorities and all manners of problems came within his province. The shadow of current difficulties cannot dim the glamor of shipping. And he said something great later on in life, where we were like, "Oh, are you worried he's got a long career". And as such, you're going to go through multiple economic growth periods and economic contractions. And he's like he's like, no, like, why aren't you worried -- at this time, his company is losing $40,000 a day or something like that, this is way in the future. Like, why don't you sell off all your assets. He's like the companies were $300 million. Like this is -- he's like recessions. I think is the word to use goes, it's all part of the game. I think it's a very healthy way to think about it. Not oh, my god, this is end of the world, people jumping off of buildings, it's, "Oh, this is normal. This happens all the time". And part of the game part is succeeding at this game in business is being able to weather these storms successfully. Okay. So it says his work as a consul enhances love of sea taking him one long step nearer to his ambition more than anything else, Aristotle Onassis wanted to own and run ships. And from the dream and the idea was only a short step to the intention and the plan to persuade himself that the plane was sound, he went in for what he called a little mental gymnastics. This is actually really smart how he decides he's going to get involved in the shipping industry. In his mind's eye, he visualized his ship with a capacity of 0.5 million cubic feet of grain, which might have cost $1 million to build in 1920. That's 10 years earlier from the point we are in the story. Now in the year 1930, such a ship could be bought for $30,000. So it might have been $1 million in good times. Now we're in financial calamity. So it's $30,000, although I had run less than half its lifespan. As an importer always concerned with storage, he calculated that it would cost 6x or 7x that amount, at least $200,000 to build an open storage hanger, just a roof without walls, not counting the price of land. So he's like, what if I just buy it now and I store the ship because the expenses are you could lose your shirt if you're running like you're paying all these expenses and you have no inventory, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he says a 10-year-old ship was good for another decade would be a floating warehouse for the price of a Rolls Royce. To Onassis, recalling his reasoning, he had a sound built-in safety factor. Even if his arithmetic proof faulting, nothing was lost. So what we're saying is I'm going to buy the assets now and I'm not going to use them. No other people are thinking like this at the time. It's really bizarre because at that time, the ship is going to be sold for scrap and would have felt have fetched twice the amount of vested. So again, not only is he doing something smart like, okay, the expense shipping is a dangerous business, but it's dangerous because you have all these daily expenses. And if you don't have cargo, right, you're going to lose a lot of money every day. But if I'm buying ships for pennies on the dollar and just wait until the economy improves, I have nothing to lose because what the ship would scrap, if I just said, you're going to destroy the ship and sell off its parts, it's going to fetch twice what I pay. So I've kept my downside. I have no downside, no upside. You can't go wrong. He told himself, but continuing his monologue on a cautionary note, took into account that while only $30,000 were needed to become a shipowner, operating the ship could easily result in a loss of $10,000 in one round trip. He had seen it happen time and time again, breaking the back of many shipowners. So he studied the industry and realized where the downfall was since he did not need a floating warehouse, but very much wanted to own a ship. He came to the conclusion that it would be a sound business to buy a bunch of secondhand ships cheaply at this time of economic depression, but most important to keep them laid up for 1, 2 or maybe 3 years and then move them, which is means when the economy picked up, moving them is when you're actually operating the ships. Ships are constantly in his mind. I must get into the business he kept saying. So essentially, he gets his first ships for 1% of their original costs.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. So I'm going to -- obviously, we know he makes his money in shipping. I'm going to get to the point where I tell you how he expands so rapidly by working backwards, which I mentioned earlier. But this is just, again, a reminder of how chaotic life is and how random it could be. One sick cook led Aristotle to one of his greatest competitive advantages and also one of the things that he gets criticized and the most for doing. Aristotle Onassis received a message at the ship, he's using an all-Greek crew, flying under Greek flag. So think of ships as many businesses and where they're registered or like if you register your business in California or New York, whatever the case is, a lot of, obviously, U.S. corporations are registered in Delaware because of certain benefits, while ships in the same way. And you can register them everywhere. That's where you see a lot of the American Cruise companies, they're American companies, but their assets are in the Bahamas or something else. They're called flag of convenience and we're going to see him use this tactic more than what are we 60 years ago, something like that. So he receives a message that the ship could not proceed to Copenhagen because the Greek console refused clearance until Greek Siemen was found to replace the ship's assisting cook had fallen ill and had been taken to the hospital. So what they're saying is they have all just like union rules, it's not like a union, but it's typical like that. It's like regulations and say, you cannot move this entire ship. And you can't just replace a cook with any guy in Copenhagen, you have to fly in a Greek, bizarre rules, right? In technicality, 1 man out of crew of 30 was holding up the ship. And what happens when you hold up ships, you cost tons and tons of money every day and trending to upset a carefully worked out schedule.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Aristotle Onassis decided to personally intercede with the council who happened to be an old friend and former schoolmate, but the console insisted on the letter of the law. A Greek cook would have to be brought in as a replacement. Onassis pleaded with his friend. His was an unreasonable request he explained. There was no air connection, meaning no airport to get them to, and it might take a week or more before another Greek cook could come from Athens. Surely won't hold up a whole ship with valuable cargo over a small matter like this. Well, of course, they do. Their answer was the same. They're not budgeting. He left the consulate and went to work. By telephone and telegram, he contacted the agents instructing them to register the ship without delay under the Panamanian flag. Within hours, the formalities were completed. So he's transferring assets from Greek to Panama. Panama doesn't have these regulations. With one stroke of this pen, Aristotle Onassis not only freed himself of the restricted practices or strengthened to delay his ship, for the first time he availed himself of the considerable advantages of Panamanian facilities, which simplified shipping procedures at a time when technical and legal complications were piling up for ships under most flag. So let me just explain to what's happening. Greek has a long history of shipping, right? And what happens over time? You're going to say, you're going to pass one rule now and then 5 years later, you had another role and then pretty soon, 100 years 200 years in the future of all these rules that may not even make sense like this, like why do I have to fly a guy or ship a Greek one Greek cook and I'm holding up my ship for 7 days. Meanwhile, you have newer countries that are trying to compete with other countries like Panama and eventually Liberia, who they don't have that history. So therefore, they don't have those rules and regulations. And they get the benefit because now you can use Panamanian workers, like you have more money spent directly in their country because that's where the ship is most of the time and see all these benefits. Going over to the Panamanian flag is Aristotle Onassis saw was like reverting to the conditions that existed before World War I under all flags when supply and demand determine success or failure. An operator was able to fix the size of the crew according to the ship's needs as opposed to just saying, "Hey, you need -- they'd have like central planning committee saying, this is how many you need". You need 30 people. What if you could get the job done with 7? Does it matter. You still need 30. It's ridiculous. Ships need there was no overmanning nor feather betting is what they called it. Owners employed people who were good at their job, discarded those who were not skilled or efficient.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

That's another thing you can really fire people. Besides a ship under the Panamanian flag was not subject to exchange regulations and could trade in any currency. This is another huge event as he has. Last but not least, taxes were negligible. In fact, taxes were nonexistent. So it's just an example of him studying and learning and then he had the confidence in himself and his ability to go in his own direction. Most tankers at this time were 9,000 tons, he decided to make 15,000 tons. This is a little bit about that. Onassis was reaching the end of a meticulous investigation to the possibilities and economics of the tanker business. He wants to transport instead doing dry goods, now he's going to do oil and stuff, which had occupied him for some time. The financial opportunities were tempting enough, but another motive gave a strong impetus to its plans. By tradition, the Greeks concentrated on dry cargo ships, considering tankers business-wise a hazardous proposition, but it's a lot of money in oil at this time. Now Onassis decided to go into tankers in a big way. So he realizes he does the math is like everybody is building 9,000. He's one of the first people to build 15,000 because he realized the economics are better. I just need to bring this up because this quick restless personality has mentioned a lot. And the note of myself, I wonder if his inpatients was exacerbated by living through war and realizing that when you have friends and people die prematurely, you realize, "Oh, life is like guaranteed, I need to move as quickly as possible."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I forgot to mention what happened to his grandmother. So his grandmother was escaping on a ship by herself, right? She gets away. And they can't find her, they can't find her, they're worried about her. Remember, his mom died and said, this is a person who raised him. His grandmother like 80 years old at that time. She goes to like another island. It might be another Greek island to escape the war that's happening. And they realize other people escaping, realize that she has money in her purse, like gold and other stuff. So she's climbing the ladder and as she's doing this like from a ship, they start trying to grab a purse and stealing from her. And eventually, she's 80 years old, and they throw her off the ladder and she dies. So unbelievable, more tragedy added to the young life of Aristotle Onassis. So this is a description of Onassis one sentence, the sailor's restless quest for change and the impatience of a quicksilver mind. I have a bunch of notes here. I don't know what they mean. It's war intercedes again or intrudes again, do what you can with what you have, and problems are just opportunity and workloads. Let's see what that note meant. To a shipping man at Greek who had seen 3 wars between his 6th and his 16th year, not to mention not to speak of the gruesome aftermaths, these were momentous deeply steering events. The economic consequences where as grim. What year am I in? Is this -- this might be -- oh yup World War II okay 1940. I'm not -- now I understand what happened. German is basically -- he's got a bunch of ships in Europe, and they get -- they get basically -- they're like, you're not moving the ships out of the harbor. So they're just stuck. Just this brings a total of his mobilized tonnage up to 50,000 tons for an independent owner, a tremendous fleet to be completely removed from its control, a tremendous amount of tons. After 15 years, now we're 15 years of him being a ship owner of almost unimpeded progress, these were the first real setbacks in the career of Aristotle Onassis. They were cruel blows so that's what I meant, the wars messing up this business. So what does he do? I'm not a country, I'm not going to go fight to German, so I have to focus, do what I can with what I have.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Now with his European takers are mobilized in the Baltic, he was forced to turn his attention to American-based ships. That's Onassis. Apart from looking after the ships, he reorganized this tobacco business and arrange for tobacco from business own Cuba to replace the Asian supplies, which were cut off by the Warrant C. So it's it, like I have a big problem. I'm going to focus on making my American and other ships as profitable as possible. And then, hey, my tobacco business is getting interrupted by war. Okay, I'll just import from a different country. He has no control over war, but you can control over how you react. The opposite of relentlessness resourceful is wasteful. And then he also preferred his organizational structure to be decentralized. So it says, Onassis felt that he might be taking charge of a company. So they have this giant Argentinian navigation company, him, and another giant shipowner. The government is trying to get him these 2 guys to invest and he's thinking about it for a while, and then he's like, wait a minute, I've identified a potential problem. And this is really smart on his behalf. He says, Onassis felt that he might be taking charge of a company which is so big that the government could not be indifferent to its future and the prospects of thousands of employees. So that's very opposite. He had a bunch of companies where all decentralized and small, right? Just the ownership was similar. There is bound to be, to say the least, interference. Onassis came to the conclusion that the risk was too great. And so what happens, like 5 years later, there's an economic depression and the government takes over that company, which could have ruined his investment. And then this is what I meant about the opposite of relentless, resourceful, is wasteful. So Onassis, who has never cut himself off completely from his early years of struggle, cannot watch waste within difference.

Okay. Now I want to get to probably the most important thing that ever happened to him. And this is what I meant about Charlie Munger's quote, invert always invert. At the time, you have the -- this is after World War II. You have a bunch of these old warships. Remember, Daniel K. Ludwig, The invisible billionaire made his money, doing almost the exact same thing that's what Onassis is doing, and it's buying these old ships retrofitting them so they can transport oil, right? But Aristotle he is making a little bit of money. He's doing well, but he can't grow -- remember, he is, I think, the largest private -- winds up having the largest private fleet in the world, if I'm not mistaken. And -- but how do you get that if no one will lend you money. So he's going around all these banks. First of all, they don't want to deal with a foreigner. So he has to do these agreements where like you have to have an American agent. So 51% of the company is to be owned by American. He can control the other 49%. This winds up coming back to bite him because they're saying that there was like fake, basically, like he was -- he can really control it, even though -- and interesting enough, some of his lawyers that set up this ownership agreement wind up working with the American government and prosecuting him. He gets out of it with a fine, but I thought that was really fascinating. But he realized like these -- no one will lend me any money. What the hell, what am I going to do? Like I don't have the money to buy all these tankers. So he works backwards. What is he trying to do, right? I want to -- I'm going to a bank. I say, "Hey, I want to buy these -- these used American ships. And I don't think it's just American, but shifts from World War II. I'm going to retrofit them and I'm going to carry oil, and that's how I'm going to make money, right? And the banks like get lost. So what does he do? He works backwards just like he did with getting into selling tobacco. He goes to the oil companies, works out the deals and says, this is -- we're going to agree upon this price. Let's say whatever the case, and I'm going to read you the numbers here in a minute.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I'm going to say, I have this contract, but I don't have the ship yet, right? So then you take this contract because they're at the time and a lot of the -- the largest companies in the world at this time are oil companies. So that's completely different. So then he takes that contract goes back to the banks and said, "Hey, look, what I have here, if you allow me to money to buy the ship, I have an agreement saying for 5 years, we're going to pay me x amount of money". This is guaranteed money. It's coming from the oil company. You think they're going to monitor the money, no, they have more assets than almost everybody else in the world. And this causes him to be able to expand his fleet massively just by working backwards. So please learn from this. All right, ready. It was a single obvious solution, a ship of 30,000 tons made $120,000 a month, a 5-year charter amounted to 60 monthly installments and that the bank -- the contract specifies. Hey, you're going to be paid $120,000 a month for 6 months -- or excuse me, for 6 years, no for 5 years, sorry, for a total of $7.2 million. The bank is comfortable because the oil companies saying, "I'm paying this due to $120,000 a month, he's going to be able to pay you back". So he basically raises their risk in their turn, in their eyes at least. This then was the proposition he put to the Socony oil company. The Socony oil company is today, Mobil. I guess, is it Mobil Exxon now? I forgot the exact -- you could look it up if you're interested, but you know how they were broken up and they're constantly like all derivatives of standard oil at some point, if I'm not mistaken. So he says, "Give me a firm commitment". He presented his complicated proposition in the shape of a simple simile. The wealthy and power, this is Onassis, the wealthy and powerful oil companies were in relation to the ships, what a tenant was in respect of the house he occupied. This is not quote but I mean, this is how he described it people. The wealthy and powerful oil companies were in relation to ships with a tenant was in the respect of the house he occupied for which he had undertaken to pay rents. If the tenant was Rockefeller, remember? Standard Oil, Onassis suggested persuasively, it did not matter whether the roof of the house had holes or was gold plated.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

If Rockefeller agreed to pay the rent, that was good enough for anyone lending money on the house. It was the same with ships. Do you see an analogy there? It's like my tenant is Rockefeller. Do you think he's not going to pay me? I'm getting paid. Eventually, the oil company is consented into this construction and their assurance to pay come hell on high water was a commitment which he gave the oil companies absolute security and established a principle which made shipping finance history. So this is what his Daniel Ludwig uses, Onassis uses, Stavros, which I might cover in the future. His brother-in-law winds up dying in Switzerland at the age of 86 with a net worth of $22 billion, mainly from using this idea as well. With this insurance in its pocket Aristotle Onassis hurried to Metropolitan Life Bank for the best part of the year in time to varying negotiations, the 2 men had in exploring this deal arguing fencing moving forward. So basically, for over a year, he's been trying to fight and get money not working. Now when he does this now, the Climax is a hand. It was a matter of a few minutes, think about it, going in the opposite direction, starting logical way from the beginning to the end, takes a year, it doesn't get anywhere. It works backwards close to deal in a few minutes. When Onassis produced a new formula, they agreed to give him the blessing alone provided there was a firm commitment by the oil company to pay in all circumstances, which it was. This was now no more than a formality. His exhilaration was more like he was super happy at this time. Obviously, you could imagine, was more like that of a man who had solved a problem like the triumph of scientist who had discovered a new formula. This is the formula he built his business on. For the banks, he then think about from their perspective, he just solved a huge problem for the banks and now he's added a new asset class for them. So they love it too. For the banks, there were suddenly a new field for investment. And one-by-one financial institutions abandoned their opposition to putting money in shipping. The dollars began to roll in. The Onassis formula opened the gate to an outflow, which eventually rose to $2 billion. And then I just want to -- on the same page, just something here that I think is really important that you need to have perseverance and belief in the inevitable thinking about why would you -- why are you working in the field you're working in? And in his case, he just thought this is inevitable.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Aristotle Onassis had not the sites intention of submitting this defeatist what it means that there's a -- everybody is telling him at this time there's a limit, like all we went from 9,000 tons to 15,000 tons. Now we're at 18,000 tons you're trying. Aristotle is trying to get us to go to 28,000 tons. Like this is not possible. And Onassis not only did he not believe it wasn't impossible, he thought it was inevitable that he's like the economics make too much sense and ships going to keep getting bigger. They're going to get bigger. And so this is how he's thinking about that. He says Aristotle Onassis had not the slightest intention of submitting to this defeatist view. For more than a decade, he had been obsessed with the idea that the future transportation was in bigger and bigger ships and the opposition of the oil companies did nothing to undermine his faith in this new development, which he thought was inevitable. So he's ahead of the curb. And if you're ahead of the curb and you know what's happening, you just wait. And eventually, they're talking about 20,000 ships, 20,000-ton ships, eventually it gets it like 100. I think he builds one that's like 106,000 tons. So way big, remember, it still sounds like 9,000 tons, almost 10x what they thought was possible. This an example that knowing human nature pays dividends, though he could be pugnacious and persistent, Onassis had little of the hard-faced unyielding tycoon in his mental makeup besides a seating to reasonable request where others were likely refused seeing a sound investment in human relations, which made many friends. So he's playing a long game here. He's not going to -- like when he's doing negotiations, he leaves something, make sure everybody walks away with something because he's not doing one-off transactions. We're just going to take everything he can realize, hey, humans like the benefit of a compounding relationship in business over a long period of time is going to make a lot more than me thinking from the short term, just trying to make maybe 5% or 10% more. So again, I think him studying history, politics, and the like. He clearly understood humans.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This is what I meant earlier about how you focus on the highest-value activities. And I said Berkshire does the same thing. He was already shredding the load of routine work by reserving decisions strictly for himself. So what they're talking about there is that if you remember how the organization -- how Berkshire Hathaway is organized is when they buy a company, they basically just -- they're like you guys are running the company, you do whatever you need to do. And we're going to leave you alone. We're just going to stay in Omaha. We're going to control 2 things. One, we're going to control the investment decisions for all the profits that the Berkshire portfolio companies make. So we're going to decide where that money goes. And like right now, I think I just read Berkshire was sitting on like $100 billion in cash or something like that. So that kind of gives you an indication of how they -- how they're looking at the current economy. And the second thing is we're going to control compensation because incentives are so important for human behavior. And so they control 2 things, and the rest is completely decentralized. So Onassis is like, listen, routine work, paperwork, I'll let the attorneys handle that people in the office handle that once we do it. But I'm going to reserve the decisions for the company, where we're putting our assets, what we're doing, that's not ever getting outsourced. That's literally my job every day.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I just -- again, he echoes -- I don't know why, but he echoes and it's interesting. I'd be very curious because Charlie Munger famous for reading hundreds, hundreds of biographies. I'm very curious, I'm sure you studied Aristotle Onassis because this is how one of Aristotle's partner describes Aristotle, but it's also, if you change the name to Aristotle , it's very much how Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett. So just an echo here. It's crazy to me, operate. So this Onassis is a curious man. He explores, asked the 100 questions, orders, or report, ask more questions arising from it, never accept a statement without checking. He masters the most complicated subject that makes his decision quickly. So he thinks, thinks, thinks and then when he acts he goes full force. Aristotle becomes rather famous, infamous in some cases, obviously, he marries Jackie Kennedy towards the end of his life, but he's way famous before that. It's not a good thing. He didn't really like it. He also becomes indicted. There's so much in this book in his life. I'm just going to have to leave out the podcast because this guy moved at 100 miles an hour every day for like 4 decades. Like at one time, he's got -- he owns like a whaling company in the Peruvian at the exact same time, like the Peruvian Navy is attacking his ships, they confiscated, he's under indictment by the Justice Department, and he's fighting with the Prince of Monaco. It's just like why -- what is this guy doing? It's crazy, but this is Aristotle becoming famous. Before I used to operate quietly, no one gave me a second glance, which I think is the best way. The press never bothered me, and I was free to come and go as I pleased. Now it is like being a movie star. People ask for your autograph. The crackpot start writing. They start writing in letters. If I'd known what was coming out of this Monte-Carlo business, publicity-wise and they'd give me $1 million, I would not have gotten into it. And he said, if I were in the passenger business, the publicity would be worth millions. In the cargo business, it only hurts. It's like having a wonderful laugh that gives you a sore throat and he -- when he was live, you had to be one of the most famous people in the world. This is the financial performance of its 30-plus companies. Never fast forwarding into the 1950s. The estimated liquidation value of his fleet between $150 million and $200 million and reckon that he had paid off more than 40% of all his mortgages, meaning the mortgages on the ships.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And once you pay off the mortgage on the ship, they become -- the profit margins are the same. They worked out that net income before amortization charges was nearly $50 million a year. And that can go up and down and it's pretty crazy. At this time, Onassis spent a lot of time in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. and around politics in general. And he makes a statement that he says, if you knew how the food was made, you wouldn't care to eat it. And you talked about the show business of that and political business, which you feel -- he never expresses says it, but it almost sounds like you thought they were similar, like they were attracted the same kind of people and operate on the same dynamics, which I've heard before, too, there's a lot of similarities between show business and politics. Somebody said politics is show business for nerds. Onassis had little doubt that the lawyers assessment of the Justice Department's case was correct. What shattered him was that the indictment, this is what I was talking about earlier. And we knew this because The Invisible Billionaire I did, the Maritime Commission winds up being like basically 100% corrupt. And then it's replaced by another commission, that one becomes corrupt, but there was just all kind of bribing, wheeling, and dealing. Obviously, these are parts, listen, there's a lot to learn from Aristotle Onassis, but he's never caught doing anything. But I mean, you think about human nature is a very good chance that these guys were getting sweetheart deals and they were getting them by leveraging the fallibility of humans. So this book is very much in like a glowing light, but I'm kind of reading between the lines. I'm like, okay, this guy definitely paid off people. So no one's perfect. We're not idolizing these people. We're learning their good ideas, and then we're discarding the bad parts. What chattered him was that the indictment had obviously been framed by Attorney General Herbert Brownell whose legal firm had advised him in the first instance that he was actually strictly within the law, that's what I said earlier, they're playing both sides, so yes, go ahead and do this 51%, 49% you're good, and then he moves to -- goes from private practice to government and then back to private practice and it kind of gets like this incestuous relationship and they kind of screw him here. If he was under indictment, why were the authorities not making a move. He was not waiting any longer from his medicine office avenue, we sent the following telegrams so he writes to him. I place myself at your disposal during my visit to this country for any information you or your department might care to have. And he says, at this time, he took a poor view of the caliber and standards of some people on high positions and said so.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he's saying he says, what aggregated him was that the attorney general did not even give them a chance for a talk, not replying to his telegram, and now he's yelling. He says, "This is the man whose legal firm had been paid big fees to advise me". There's some shady stuff on both sides happening here. He also, some of this so to make some mistakes. He brings us on to some degree on himself at the time -- so the theory is not only that you may have paid people off, but there's theory because at this exact same time, the indictment was happening in the United States is he does this deal with Saudi Arabia. He's like, "Hey, the American companies just come over here, they're drilling your oil, they're transporting your oil, like, why don't you do it?" And we'll do like a joint venture kind of thing. And he was going to take like 10% of their business away from them. But like I just said earlier, like these oil companies, these American oil companies are some of the biggest and most profitable companies in the world at the time. And they have a very incestuous loving relationship with the U.S. government. In fact, it's very hard to determine where an oil company begins in the government or oil company ends the government begins their vice versa. So one theory is that the indictment came because they're trying to take this business in Saudi Arabia. So they're like, okay, you want to try to take our business where we're going to try to put you in jail and we're going to find you. So it says one theory was that this indictment was engineered to punish him for his alliance with the Saudi Arabians. They regarded the Saudi Arabian deals; Onassis is revenge for his treatment by the U.S. Authority. So there's -- it's not sure which one of these is true, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Was he punished by the Justice Department after the Saudi Arabian deal? Or is he doing the Saudi Arabian deal because he thought that he was being punished unfairly. So it depends on which perspective. We don't really know. Acting on the assumption that is what is good for the United States oil companies is good for the United States. Aramco, which is the Saudi Arabian oil company, but it's also made up, if I'm not mistaken, this time, they have like these United States oil companies have like interest in it. I don't know if that's -- if it's just like a payment based on like fees or if they actually own equity in it. Arm in arm with the government voice extreme consternation. So this is the government coming after Onassis and the oil companies at the same time. That's what I mean you don't know where one starts and when ends. So they voiced extreme consternation. A Dash of xenophobia aggravated the ugly mood. Member xenophobia has brought up all the time in modern day. Xenophobia is nothing new at all. And in fact, most of the book is about the fact that like you'd only get deals like Greek would give deals at Greeks, they wouldn't mess with Argentinians, and they wouldn't mess with this person. It's a very like tribalistic undertones in this entire book. Dash xenophobia aggravated the ugly mood. American officials were just said to be petered less transportation of oil became dependent on the naturalized citizen of a country, Argentina, which is not always readily cooperated with the West. So they want an American to control Saudi Arabian oil, not in Argentina. So the book goes back and forth in this for a long time. This plays out for a very long time. I'm just going to go to the very end. Because as was want to do, Aristotle Onassis was sitting on the deck of the Christina, that's his yacht, staring out at the wide expanse of the sea. He liked the loneliness of the night when all was quiet, he going to be alone with his thoughts for hours, I do you, sending them out as if it were across the ocean and over the horizon like tentacles to bring back new ideas and solutions to old problems.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The subject that agitated him at this turbulent stage was the indictment hanging over its head in the United States and the civil claim linked with the criminal proceeding, so they hit them both. They drop the hidden with a civic charge first, civil charge first and then a criminal charge as well. As a result of his community with himself in the dead of the night, he decided abruptly to take the next flight to New York. He did not like it kind like it was just weighing on too much. I'm just going there I'm going to face whatever happens. And a lot of other -- he's not the only one indictment or bunch of other people in the shipping industry are -- let me just wrap up this part of the book. The just department wanted $20 million. They settled for $7 million a day after they set off for $7 million, they drop a criminal charge. So we still don't know who -- it sounds like both sides to me, we're up to some shady c_*_. And knowing -- studying human nature as I do like they're both doing some shady things. I just put it that way. Okay. I need to read this part to you, "Oh, man, the shipping industry is insane". And I'm going to -- hopefully, this makes sense. Uses a lot of numbers in here, but just bear with me because this is Aristotle, just Aristotle describing, the volatility. Volatility obviously can make a fortune and can destroy a fortune, right? And -- but it's very hard to not have -- to not become wealthy without some form of volatility, right? And hopefully, the volatility is obviously going in your direction. So check this out about the volatility of the shipping industry. Onassis mused about the vagaries of the tanker marking, which he had made his millions. This is quote from him. Take the last 20 years, roughly the period since the end of the war, World War II that is. He said, asking indulgence in cases memory is not accurate to the last $100,000. Immediately after the war, I'm going to omit the size of the tankers because they're not important, but the numbers are -- the dollar amounts are important.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

All of these values based on their earning capacity in a freight market, which fluctuates just as crazy from a peak of $40 per ton to a low of $4 per ton. So not only the assets going up and down, but what you can make on them, of course, is going up and down. And this is Onassis -- this is still a direct quote from Onassis. He says the stock exchange fluctuations of the 20s and 30s by comparison, our Monte-Carlo roulette for that matter, were as mild as flooders at a church Pasar. So I just want to include that part because it really does give some context that the industry that he chose to make his living in and how just dangerous and chaotic it was, which again ties into his personality. So I'm cutting a lot of part he starts an airline. In this case, he's sitting down with the premier Greece, and he does this like $500 million investment in Greece. But I just want to grab this little part out because there's a book -- I don't think I've ordered it yet, but it's all about the feud between -- just like comparing -- if you went back and listened to the podcast comparing and contrasting the methods that Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, they're very different in how they're building rocket companies. I think it would be interesting to do one from a historical perspective because obviously, the race between Blue Origin and SpaceX is still ongoing. But I think in the future, I might do a founder's up just on the relationship between and the feud between Aristotle Onassis and Stavros. His last name is N-I-A-R-C-H-O-S. So Niarchos, something like that. But -- so just give you a preview of that in case I do that one day. He is sitting down with the Premier Greece. His name is Karamanolis is one of the few people who seemed unaware that only a short while earlier Onassis had given a frank and pointed account of his relations with Stavros. So the Premier of Greece is trying to get them to team up with them because they're always brother law didn't realize. And so now this is ARISTADA really singly describing his relationship with them. He says in business, we cut each other's throats. But now and then we sit around the same table and behave for the sake of the ladies, meaning their wives, the Livanos sisters, who remain totally unaffected by the rivalry of their spouses. How bizarre is that? They go to war and then maybe see each other at the holidays, I don't even know.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But Stavros -- Onassis dies relatively young. At the end of this book ends, well, I'll tell you, the book ends, it's printed when Onassis is 62, and he dies a few years later. Stavros survives for quite a while. He dies at 86. So -- but I do think they're both interesting people that prior acquire further study. Real quick, I just want to go -- tell you a little bit more about how the Suez Canal's crisis, how you pronounce that affected Onassis? And he basically made $60 million to $70 million really quickly from that and says, Onassis was still suffering from the aftereffects of the Saudi Arabian affair and the oil companies boycott. So like I referenced earlier, when he tried to take that the -- about 10% of the business from the American companies from Saudi Arabia, they blacklisted them. So it says he found it difficult to get new businesses because I was in the doghouse with the oil companies he said and can get no new charters, I had a great number of idle ships on my hands, and that's really bad because it's going to cost them a lot of money. This is around the time he's losing about $40,000 a day. Suez was a godsend so he has all these ships just sitting there at a time when now you need ships. As soon as the canal was closed Onassis ships took advantage of the skyrocketing rates. His idle ships turn into mints, meaning just printing money. Instead of facing great difficulties, the position was ideal in these circumstances. Look at this b**_*_** his competitors were saying, he himself said this is poetic Justice. Poetic Justice helped to bring off a tremendous financial co.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

His estimated -- he estimated his profits arising out of the crisis at anything between $60 million and $70 million. But again, we go back to how crazy this industry is, but the shipping boom did not last. Unexpectedly into the surprise of the highest authorities Onassis continued instead of taking an indefinite time to open up again, meaning canal it only took a few months to clear the canal. This had the effect of suddenly turning the whole subject of side down, but still in a $60 million or $70 million in a few months. None of the belligerents had won this who has war, but the only big -- I mean like New York country won the war, but the only ones that one was the big tanker operators. Onassis, Stavros, which is his brother-in-law broad Livanos, which is another Greek rival of his, but also his father-in-law so Stavros and Onassis, marry Livanos, who's like -- who is a famous Greek shipping tycoon before Onassis and Stavros ran a business. He's like 15 or 20 years older than them, and they marry his daughters. And Daniel K. Ludwig, the American shipowner, who built their super tankers just in time. So Ken, another example, books being the original links they kind of all ties to each other. And one other thing I want to tell you speed and making the inconvenient convenient. I came across this and I thought it was a really unique quote. I haven't heard from anywhere, so I want to share with you. He was having difficulty controlling his temper, now this is a quote from Onassis. People think the great advantage of the Panamanian or Liberian flag is taxation, he said, speaking vehemently. Over and above taxation, when you're saying, yes, you may say on taxes, but it's an important part. Over and above taxation, the advantage is the lack of restriction, absence of interference, meaning he likes control or delay any like speed by governments, free currency exchange, which helps because of the voluntary currencies and speed and decisions in this quote I thought it was fascinating to compete in the most constructive way, one has to make the inconvenient convenience.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I just want to read that one more time to you to compete in the most constructive way. One has to make the inconvenient convenience. And finally, the last sentence of the book, I want to bring this to your attention. It says the end of the story question mark, not at all. Aristotle Socrates, which is the middle name, Onassis, was setting out to show that life begins at 62. He's already married Jacky Kennedy at the time. The reason I wanted to bring that point up is because he should -- I'm sure he didn't think he'd be dead in 5 years from now. His son dies in a plane accident at 24, Onassis never recovers and dies himself 2 years early -- or 2 years later, rather - and this whole family how to -- like devastating, he winds divorcing his wife, his wife dies from a drug overdose like a year or 2 before he dies. His daughter dies of a pulmonary -- something to do with our heart, but it sounds to me like drugs too when she was in her 30s, his son dies at 24. So it was also very tragic. But the reason I bring that up is because he's adding the book saying, "Oh, I'm just getting going". I have so many more ideas. He didn't think it was going to be even though 69 is not too young to die it is rather -- I mean, it's kind of young in that sense. The reason I bring that up is we don't know how much time we have. So let's make the most of it. Let's go out and live the life or we want to live, do the things that we want to do and work on the things we want to work on. I'll close there. I'll leave a link in the book. It's very hard to get. Some of the -- I've seen this just -- I think there -- you can get the book for as little as $3 and as much as like $95. If you're interested in it. I'll leave a link, like I always do. Thank you very much for the support. I appreciate you listening, and I'll be back next week with another biography of an entrepreneur.

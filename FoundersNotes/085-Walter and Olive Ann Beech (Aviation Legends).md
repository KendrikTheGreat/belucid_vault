“It's the war, that throaty growl, a sound so distinct and intriguing that it causes your eye and your ear to search the sky for its source. A tiny spec on the horizon draws nearer, and soon a dramatically different-looking airplane comes into view. It looks mighty and powerful, but at the same time, sleek and elegant. One wonders, who was venturesome and inventive enough to build and design this beautiful maverick.” This book is a story of how that unique airplane and many others came to be and the 2 people responsible for their creation. They were Walter and Olive Ann Beech, co-founders of Beech Aircrafts, and I am proud to say they were my parents. These 2, both forceful and determined, even if rather eccentric personalities, combine their individual strengths and talents with uncanny ease and rapport to create an extremely successful company with an undisputed reputation of excellence in quality and service. What were their experiences that launched them on the path that eventually led them together? How did 2 individuals with rather humble beginnings reach such great heights and accomplished so much at a time when aviation was young and America was struggling through the Great Depression, and women executives were rare or nonexistent. My mother was a reserved and elegant lady. She carried herself with dignity. She was extremely insightful and loyal. She also could be rather imperious and her very demeanor commanded respect. This quality served her well when she took over Beech Aircraft after my father’s sudden death. She was then a woman in a man's world. The idea of a woman CEO, let alone the CEO of a Fortune 500 size aircraft company was almost unheard of in those days, but she did more than survive. She took the company to new heights and became finally known as the first lady of Aviation. It has long been in my mind and heart to have a biography written about these 2 remarkable people. Much has been written about the airplanes Beech Aircraft made, but little has been written about the man and the woman behind those airplanes. Very little is known about the warmth of their personalities and the strength of their characters. How did they meet adversity? How did the 2 of them, each so strong and so stubborn managed to work together? He called her Annie, and she called him Pauper. Together, they built a company whose name became a byword for excellence. This is their story, a very human story and one that I wanted to tell.

So that is actually Walter and Olive's daughter, Mary Lynn Oliver, writing in the forward for the book that I read this week and the one that I'm going to talk to you about today, which is The Barnstormer and the Lady, Aviation Legends Walter and Olive Ann Beech by Dennis Farney. And I just thought of something while I was reading that. I'm going to go back to the first page real quick before we jump into the rest of the book. And where is the sentence that I'm looking for? Okay. So it talks about that they were both forceful and determined, they were rather eccentric and says what led them to create an extreme -- this sentence, an extremely successful company with an undisputed reputation of excellence in quality and service. Undisputed Reputation for Excellence And I just -- the thought just randomly popped in my mind, like, I think it's a good goal for everybody that wants to start a company or any kind of work that you want to do is that your children can look back, her -- in this case, the daughter, Mary Lynn, is writing those words about 60 years after her father died and about 15 years or 20 years after her mother died. I don't know why I thought about that just now, but I think that's a really good goal to have your children look back at what you were doing, the kind of person you were and be very proud of you. So I want to tell you first how I found this book. I ordered it a few months ago, maybe a month or 2 ago. And it was -- actually if you listened to Founders #65 on Kirk Kerkorian, so Beech Aircraft winds up being this giant, massively successful company. I had never heard of it before I read. I think the book is called The Gambler and it's the life of Kirk Kerkorian, which is a fantastic book, and that the podcast it did -- actually a lot of people liked it. So if you haven't listened to it, go back and listen to it, I think it was interesting. But in that book, and I don't know if I referenced another podcast, but in that book, Kirk deals because he's in aviation as well, so he introduces us, I guess, the author that's writing about Kirk's life, introduces us to the presence that was Olive Ann Beech. And so I was like, "Oh, okay, I never heard of this person, let me go look," and I searched Amazon. First I read her Wikipedia page and then I searched Amazon and found this book.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And it's kind of like I have a hard cover version. I don't even if it's another version, but it's almost like it's a family like album, telling the story of not only the family, but the work they did. There's tons of pictures and anecdotes. And what it reminds me of is if you listen to Founders #52, which is The Republic of Tea, a lot of what I'm going to talk to you about today comes from Olive Ann's personal -- I wouldn't say a lot, but a good portion of what I found most fascinating was she's a very private lady, she didn't do a lot of interviews. And so a lot of the insights we're going to have into how she thought and how she worked came from her personal notes, her personal diary. And just like in The Republic of Tea, which -- it's a book, but essentially, it's somebody compiled faxes between the 3 cofounders of Republic of Tea. Going back, like they had like 2 years of planning stage and then when they started finally launching the company, I think that's when the book ends, and you see like they're -- I don't think they thought it was going to be a book. You see how they thought and what they're experiencing as it happened. And I think that's incredibly insightful. Something I referenced when I studied Henry Royce because he took such notes about his work that eventually Rolls-Royce combined his notes into a book and gave it to future employees. So they understood like the level of quality that they were expected to meet. So then, as I'm reading this book and I'm learning about both Olive Ann and her husband, Walter, I was -- I originally, when I said I will do the podcast or when I was thinking about doing the podcast, I was saying, okay, I'll cover both of them combined, similar to what I did on Founders 51 with the 2 founders of Banana Republic, who were also married and they were also featured in Founders 52 because they were some of the co-founders for The Republic of Tea. And then you quickly realize like, no, I'll -- you need to isolate and talk about Olive Ann because Walter dies. And he has a massive heart attack, he dies. And for the next 30, 35 years roughly of the company, it's Olive Ann show. She's by far the most important character in the book. Before I jump into the book, I just want to say you about the private podcast that feed I have that's reserved exclusively for people that are helping spread the word about this podcast.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So there's multiple ways you can access it. None of it costs money and I also don't give them away for free. I reserve it exclusively for people that are willing to leave reviews, recommendations or talk about the podcast on social media. So for example, if you're listening to this podcast on Overcast, they have a recommendation function where if you press that star, it turns gold. If you take a screenshot of that showing that you've recommended by pressing a star and e-mail to me at foundersreviews@gmail.com, I'll reply back with a personal e-mail with that private podcast link, it gives you access to 7 podcasts that are created, that are available nowhere else. If you're listening on places like Apple Podcasts or Stitcher anywhere else, you can actually leave a review. Leave review, take a screen shot of review, e-mail to me at foundersreviews@gmail.com, same situation there. And then something I just started, I think, a week or 2 ago which is also helpful, is if you talk about the podcast, let's say, on Twitter and you mentioned add Founder's podcast, you can just say, "hey, I recommend this podcast, if you guys want to check it out." Some people even mentioned specific episodes they liked, which I really loved. I like that idea. So if you want to do that, that works, too. I will automatically DM you the private podcast link. As long as you're following me on Twitter, it let me do the -- let me DM you right away. Okay. So that's just a way for me to say thank you and hopefully incentivize you with spreading, obviously, the podcast. Okay. So let's go and jump in the book. I'm going to tell you a little bit about her personality. It says in one absolutely central way, they were exactly the same. They're talking about Walter and Olive Ann. Each was determined to be in control. She had a lady -- her lady like demeanor was coupled with a pronounced bent for managing figures and managing money. So that was her, I would say, her primary skill. Her husband was like a -- that's why it's called The Barnstormer. He was an early like -- basically stunt pilot and pioneer in the aviation industry. But he was integral in producing a lot of their first airplane designs based on what he would experience in the air. But it's mentioned many times in the book that the company would have undoubtedly went under and failed like a lot of the early airplane manufacturers did without her ability to manage resources and to make sure that payroll is met and that the company was turning a profit.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

A little bit more about her personality just so you understand who she was as a person. It says, Mrs. Beech had no time for dumb questions. No time for prying questions at all. She would dismiss them with a little wave of her hand. In this, she resembled another captain of industry, Henry Ford, who lived by terse motto; never complain, never explain. Once somebody asked her why she didn't sit down for more in-depth interviews. This is her response. She says, they'll ask me why Blue is my favorite color," she said, "What makes me laugh and what makes me cry, maybe I don't want them to know." The few times in her life that she did grant interview. She always regretted it. She was an intensely, intensely private person. And something also you might want to know is they would reference her that she was an iron fist in a velvet glove. So if you ever see pictures of her and there's tons of pictures in this book of her, she looks absolutely glamorous, but she was extremely quiet and relentless. So I think that's where she got the moniker of iron fist in a velvet glove. Before I jump back into her personality, I just want to talk a little bit about -- because I find it so fascinating that they started essentially at the beginning of a massive industry. This is very -- it kind of echoes what we were -- what you and I were talking about on the podcast with Empires of Light with the beginning of the electricity industry. So it says, the lives of Walter and Olive Ann span almost all of that history, meaning the aviation history. From its daredevil years of 1920 barnstormers and wing-walkers to today's multibillion-dollar industry, she didn't step down, she died in like 1993 and she didn't step down from the company, I think until like 1980 or something like that. So it says, this is a story of that uniquely American type, the entrepreneur.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Entrepreneurs don't merely create new products and new ideas through their work and their enterprise -- enterprises, they define and create themselves, such an interesting thought. When entrepreneurs fail, their failures can be as spectacular as an airplane crash. But when they succeed, whole new industries grow up where none existed before, with economic and social implications beyond their most expansive beginnings. So Olive Ann actually starts out in the aviation industry, working for a company called Travel Air. They hire her. I think she's 19 at that time, and she becomes Walter's secretary. And the note I left for myself is you don't know something, it doesn't matter. You can learn and here's an example of that. It says when she first became Walter's secretary, she had to ask a company engineer to draw her a sketch of an airplane with its essential parts labeled. Back then, in one associate's words, she didn't know an aileron from a tail feather. I'd actually look up what an aileron was too because I didn't know what that was. And it is actually a hinge service in the trailing edge of an airplane wing that's used to control lateral balance. If you've ever been sitting by the wing of an airplane, you see it go up and down during the flight. It’s that little flap, I guess, I would call it. My point being here is you have somebody that winds up becoming one of the most important figures in all of aviation history. And of course, no one's born knowing what we need to know, everybody learns that. And so she starts out as a young 19-year-old, not knowing anything to the point where she doesn't even know the -- like how an airplane is constructed, like what are the important parts, to basically dominating and becoming one of the most important people in the industry. So now I'm going to jump into some of her mottos and codes. Her life codes that we see from her private diary. And this is -- the book is going to reference her diary and her private journal a lot. I think it might be my favorite parts. So it says, it was dangerous to be a reverent of Mrs. Beech. She is a very serious person. Grown men would flinch when they were summoned to stand on her blue carpets. There only raising her voice, she would tell them precisely what she wanted done or where they had aired. She would tolerate one mistake, but live by the model; fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Few people got the chance to fool her 3 times. It says she was very demanding, and she was the head of everything. Olive Ann lived by a code of self-reliance that she learned from her parents and now here's some of the codes that she learned from her parents. Sit on your own blisters," which means live with your own mistakes. When a job is once begun, never leave it until it's done, be the labor great or small, do it well or not at all, sit up straight and tall, throwback your shoulders back, and breath. This was her recipe for steadying herself in anxiety-pounding situations. So on the very next page, I love this part. She was always learning. And of course, you're going to have to, to be able to stay on top of an industry for almost half a century. And then she's also obsessed with having the power of positive thinking. This is something in my own life I call PMA, which is positive mental attitude, which I'll talk about in a minute. So it says, she was perhaps -- this is where we're going to get an idea of her early life and her lack of education, which I hate using that word, but it says, she was perhaps more conscious than she led on, on the lack of a college education. He formal education stopped with a Wichita area business school, but her self-education never stopped. So I don't think even think she went to high school. I think she skipped high school. And then the business schools like they were teaching people how to do like basic, like office management, secretary work and stuff like that. Her personal desk diaries are full of words and phrases she was teaching herself. So here is one of them that she wrote. It's in French, I think, it says, coup de main. And it says the definition of that is a swift attack that relies on speed and surprise to accomplish its objectives in a single blow. Remember coup de main. That's important for later on.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Another one she wrote down; steel true, blade straight. Pasted into the diaries are numerous self-help maxims and testaments to the power of positive thinking and here's like a short little --almost like a poem that she wrote, and she wanted to memorize. "You can't expect your ships to come home unless you send them out, stand up to be seen, speak up to be heard, shut up to be appreciated. No one can make you inferior without your consent." That's another important motto of hers. No one can make you feel inferior, that phrase, it seems as key to understanding this elegant, successful, very private woman. And what she's calling there the power of positive thinking, I repeat this over and over again so much that like I get kind of made fun of. But I think the combination of a positive mental attitude and perseverance, I think the combination of those 2 traits is like the key to overcome almost any problem that you may have. And I think it's extremely important. Going back to that way, the famous Andrew Carnegie quote, the paraphrase I don't have it in front of me, but it's like, the mind can be brought into sunshine. That's not -- hold on. Let me look it up real quick because I'm butchering that quote. That's not -- I don't think that's how it starts. It says, most famous quote, okay, "A sunny disposition is worth more than fortune. Young people should know that it can be cultivated; that the mind, like the body can be moved from shade into sunshine." I think it's essential for your mind to be in sunshine and not in the shade. This is just some funny stuff that comes across because I think the beginnings, like I've talked a lot about, the beginning of industries are just fascinating to me. So here's a list of flight safety rules. It says flight safety rules of that era, let's say, early 1920s, maybe even before, clearly indicates the precarious seat of the pants, nature of the whole business. And this is 10, I'm just going to pull out 4 of them that made me chuckle.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“Pilots should carry hankies in a handy position to wipe-off goggles. Riding on steps, wings or tail of a machine is prohibited." This was the funniest one, "Do not trust altitude instruments." And then this was a bizarre one, "Pilots will not wear spurs while flying." And it's just another example that everything big starts small. And when you go and analyze things that are now big and you look at them when they were once small, they just look vastly different and you see stuff like that, I think it's humorous. So a lot of these -- Beech aircraft was founded and the entire history of its -- the company was based in Wichita, Kansas. And it's bizarre, like there's a bunch of other companies, aircraft companies at that time that get started there. So the question I had for myself was like why was Wichita the Air Capital, like it came up with that nickname like why did it happen in Kansas? Like it just seems random. So some people had theories, and this was one of them. They said, the sky was usually clear and the flat planes all around were forgiving environment for pilots. It says no territory in the world has more natural emergency landing fields, every wheat field in Kansas is one. So that kind of makes sense. But the author says, no, it's not actually why. It's because Wichita had a lot of money. By 1918, Kansas was producing nearly 13% of the entire U.S. oil production. So a lot of the entrepreneurs that had made money in oil production then started and turned funding and starting in some cases, these aircraft companies. And it says, like let me just get the list. Some of them might sound familiar to you, Beech Aircraft, Cessna, maybe the most famous aircraft company of all time was founded there, Stearman Aircraft, which in turn would eventually be merged with Boeing Aircraft, and then later in the book, Learjet also starts in Kansas.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. So let's talk more about her early life. And it says, when Olive Ann was just a girl, she went to a soda fountain one day and encountered a boy who not only teased her but also occupied the last remaining stool. So she pushed him off the stool and took it for herself. Sometimes you just have to do these things. She explained decades later to a friend, sometimes you just have to do these things. The remarks as a great deal about the inner core of the steely, quietly assertive woman. Her birthplace was a rural farmhouse that her father had built with his own hands. The stern maxims that Olive Ann would live by, sit on your own blisters, for example, sit up straight and tall, were instilled into her from the very beginning. She had a pronounced bent towards order and organization. So she definitely came from humble beginnings, not only did her father have to build the house they live in, but she's living in a tiny town at this point, and there's only 600 people and it's called Waverley. It says, “Meticulous and mature beyond her years, she had her own bank account by age 7 and was handling all the bill paying for her parents by age 11.” So they wind up, her father's a carpenter by trade, and they have to move from this tiny town and they have to go to where like the big city for more opportunity. And I just chuckles, it was a growing town approaching 3,000 citizens at the time. She never attended high school. Instead, she attended the American Secretarial and Business College. She also took night courses. Then at age 17, she went to work as a bookkeeper and office manager for an electrical appliance and contracting firm. She lived in a boarding house there and on the side, kept books for Joe's Garage.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So she had a own little kind of side business here. These 2 jobs together earned her $18 a week. By this time, she was already practicing what will become a lifelong habit of collecting admonitions on the good life and how to live it. And so she collects all these little maxims and poems that she wants to reference back. Here's one of them. It says, "I have to live with myself. And so I want to be fit for myself to know, I want to be able, as the days go by to always look myself in the eye. I don't want to stand with the setting sun and hate myself for the things I have done." To reference Carnegie again, he says the internal judge reigns supreme, I think, is the quote, meaning it's most important that how you -- the most important thing is how you feel -- truly feel about yourself and to make sure that you're making yourself and changing yourself into a person that you can actually respect. One offered this philosophical advice on the value of perseverance. That's one thing she definitely never would give up. “The one who sticks to a losing cause, although his fortunes get a fall may find that gaining strength and pride, he's not the loser after all." Two qualities Olive Ann never lacked were self-confidence and assertiveness. One day she marched into a local bank or -- she marched into a local bank one day and asked for a loan of $1,000, a substantial sum at that time, particularly for someone making $18 a week, but somehow, she talked the bank into giving it to her. As it turned out, the loan was part of a larger strategy. After a couple of weeks, she repaid it, having held on to the money and now she had a credit rating. Okay. So now I want to skip ahead to the founding of Beechcraft. Travel Air winds up getting purchased by another company. They moved from Kansas to New York City. They're not able to build the airplanes they want, and so they wind up leaving and starting their own company in the heart of the Great Depression. It says, the company was a huge gamble for all 3 of them. So there was Walter, Olive Ann, and then one of the engineers, the other co-founder.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

To be sure, Walter and Olive Ann left New York with a tidy sum. As stockholders, they had sold Travel Air high and now the depression would enable Beech Aircraft to buy back into the airplane business low. Even so, it was about the worst possible time to launch a new business. It took more than money and more than a promising idea. It took courage. America came close to rock bottom in 1932. So this is the economic environment they're launching into. It says, crude oil sold for $0.10 a barrel. The entire aviation industry produced a total of only 549 commercial planes valued at little more than $2 million. So the ground floor, the entire aviation industry, $2 million this time, that's insane. And they had a very simple, as you can tell, like Olive really liked to orient around simple ideas and simple rules. So the idea for the company was we were going to build the best damn airplane ever and no near depression is going to stop us. So not only are they going to launch during the depression, but they take this counterintuitive strategy of making it a super expensive luxury plane, and it works. So it says, Beech Aircraft began in a small corner of a Cessna factory, leased from the Cessna Board of Directors. In the teeth of the depression, Beech aircraft began building, not a cheap plane tailored to hard times, but a luxury plane. With depression era sales of even inexpensive airplanes plummeting, they wagered their future on this line of costly airplanes. And the name of the plane was the Model 17, almost 100 years later, and it was voted by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the most beautiful airplane of all time. And there's a bunch of pictures in the book. I mean, it looks amazing. It's gorgeous. So it says, it was Olive Ann who juggled the books, met the payroll and collected the bills. There was one occasion in which Walter was worried about a $10,000 unpaid bill from a customer in Texas. Olive Ann drove down, drove back, and plunked the $10,000 on his desk. “There's your damn money,” she said.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so while Walter was focused on trying to build the Model 17 and then obviously put it into production, she focused on making sure the company was frugal, they were not wasteful. As you just heard, they started out -- they were like subleasing space from Cessna. So they kept all their expenses as low as possible until sales started rolling in, but they did not -- they managed resources intelligently enough to make sure they didn't short-change the actual product that they were making. And then this was interesting. So the note I write to myself was, "Naysayers are constant." This is how they're starting to -- so everybody said, like, this is a stupid idea. Of course, like you're building an expensive plane, as you know there's the Great Depression going on, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And so they wind up running an ad, and I love what they did here. It says, “In high good humor, the ad compared the Model 17 to past inventions that had also drawn initial scorn.” So this tells you something about Olive Ann and Walter too. They just didn't -- they believed in their convictions. They believed in their ability. I think the reference is like, they believe in their ability to shape the future through their own efforts. So they had supreme level of confidence. And so this ad says, they basically ignored -- not only did they ignore initial scorn, but they used it to their benefit and used it as a marketing material. So they talk about the telephone and then in parenthesis in the ad, it talks about like what people said when these inventions came out at the time. It says, "Oh my God, it talks." The steam-powered train engine, unimportant, and the Wright Brothers airplane, both crazy, but Beech Aircraft has had the last laugh. As the company put it, “The early critics of the Beechcraft are now busy trying to imitate its many superior features. The Beechcraft is out in front and will stay there.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I think that counterintuitive point still holds true today. So let me give you an example, like you could buy a normal like regular plane at this time for, let's say $3,000. The Model 17 was priced anywhere from $8,000 to $24,000. So as long as you're building one of the best products available, in this case, they definitely were, like the companies are able to charge more, it logically follows like they're going to have more money. They're going to -- in many cases, they have larger margins. And that -- having more money and having larger margins even though the aviation industry is not like excessive margins by any means, is what actually helped the company survive and then thrive throughout the 30s. So it's definitely not the take that somebody that has never done something like this before would approach. Like oh, the depression, okay, let me make the cheapest plane possible. Well, if you make the cheapest plane possible, one, you have less overall dollars, so you're selling a plane for $2,000 instead and your margins are smaller. So what are you going to do? Like you're going to go out of business, you can't do that. This is a little bit more about Olive's personality, and then this is going to be bad times ahead. So there's many coups that Olive Ann has to deal with. One happens when Walter gets extremely sick and then another happens when he dies and both the motivation for the coup is because they didn't think women should be running companies. So it's obviously just an indication like the time that we're in and the environment that she's having to work through. Before I get there to World War II though, there's something that's interesting. There's races for airplanes, like the car industry before it provided a unique marketing opportunity for these companies. In fact, there's a movie being made about this because Ford, some of the early like attention and publicity that Ford got was by building racecars and he used that publicity to spur car sales for obviously like for normal people, non-racecars. Well, the same thing is playing out in airplanes. And they used it, Beech used it for -- like to establish early credibility. And then, of course, after the creditability follows sales orders.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, Beech airplanes continue to compete in air races, they competed in the 1936 Mile High Air race in Denver, Colorado; a Beech Staggerwing, which is one of the planes they created or they were manufacturing, won that race and 2 more Beech planes finished in the top 5. This led to an often-repeated company boast. It takes a Beechcraft to beat a Beechcraft. There's 2 traits of Olive Ann that may seem contradictory but I don't think they are. She was enamored with business. In fact, she'd asked to be driven around Wichita and she would keep a list and notes of all the new businesses. But at the same time, she made a point of laying her work aside when the day was done, and this is, I think, something that a lot of people struggle with because it is also a counterintuitive point that, oh, okay, if I just put in more hours, if I just keep working, I'll make more progress. And sometimes, I think it's better to -- it's harder to maybe to put it down and let like you just have more time to think about it. So let's say, you end your day at 5:00 or 6:00, whatever the case is. And then for several hours, like your brain on a conscious and subconscious level, like you're going to be thinking about all the stuff you're doing during the day. And I think that's why a lot of people always talk about like, oh, I had an insight, it was in the shower the next morning. Like it's -- Elon's talked about this, even though he doesn't abide by that, that it's like, oh, it's not that you're having an idea in the shower, it's just like the -- he's down -- I think he has like a typical geeky way of describing.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He's like, "Oh, I'm downloading last night's computation." But Olive Ann definitely was interested and had a passion for her business, but also knew when to turn it off, I guess, is the point I'm trying to make. So now we're going to get into the note I write to myself is speed. The speed was made necessary and plus, we all have potential than we know, more potential than we know rather. So now this was the very beginning of World War II and it says, “Now the concern wasn't finding jobs for existing workers. It was finding workers to handle a gush of wartime orders. So the growth of this company due to World War II is staggering. So the company was building planes and hammering together new factories as fast as it could. In only 83 days, it erected 2 sprawling assembly buildings exceeding 300,000 square feet. Remember, they started in a tiny little sublease from Cessna. Skeptical onlookers question whether such monstrous structures were even necessary. Soon, Beech would outgrow even these structures and had to be forced to expand into hastily erected tents outside. Congress had appropriated money for only -- in April 1940. It says, “Congress had appropriated money for only 47 new warplanes. Only a month later, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt called upon the aircraft industry to gear up for producing 50,000 new planes.” So it goes from okay, we're going to pay for 47. Oh, no, not 47, make that 50,000. So that's what I mean we all have more potential than we know and that the speed was made necessary. So it says by June 1940, Beech had a backlog of orders totaling $1.2 million. By September, so does that July, August -- 3 months later, by September, it was $22 million, so it was almost 22x. And a few months later, $82 million. The payroll jumped from 700 employees before the war to 6,000 and then jumped again to 17,700.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So an additional 17,000 employees. The factory began turning out new models, it's called the Model 18 before the newly expanded assembly areas even had heat. This is what I meant about we all more potentially know. In addition to that is so they're having to -- they're working in a factory, right? And they have to get the work done because it's literally life and death at this point, okay? So it says before the newly expanded assembly areas even had heat, the temperature within the buildings was kept barely above freezing. So they have to have these like, they're not even space heaters because I don't think they exist at the time. Obviously, they had to have artificial waste to heat it up, heat the area like the factory is up before they had like central heating because the tools would freeze to the side of the airplanes. And so that's what I mean about we all have more potential and we're way more adaptable than we have even an inkling of thought of. You just have to be forced into that environment and then you're going to adapt. They didn't by choice wanted to make planes and deal with steel and aluminum and all these tools in an environment where the temperature is freezing, but they had to, and guess what, they survived, they adapted. It's not easy, and that's not the point. The point is that humans are much more capable than we think. I listened to an audiobook a few months ago, it's a guy named David Goggins, it's called Can't Hurt Me. And only -- I didn't finish the second half of the book because I'm more interested in like as you could see from the podcast, like the beginnings of people's lives and especially like this guy had really just messed up, he was a -- his dad was really abusive, beat the crap out of him and his mom and sold drugs and had guns everywhere. And he just took that like pain and suffering and used it as fuel, right? But he said something in the book that I thought was interesting. And he's convinced that most humans are living at 40% of their actual capabilities. So we just got used to like not tapping into our potential and I really like that idea. So he used that in like a physical form, he's like 300 pounds at the time, and he wants to join the Navy, they're like, no, you're too fat, like you got to lose weight, he had to lose like 100 pounds. I forget -- let's say, 100 pounds in 40 days or something like that. Then he starts running. He's never ran in his life, so he's running 100-mile races.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And he just realized like, oh, I had all this untapped potential before I would just sit at home, I'd come home from work, he was like an exterminator, like people like go to businesses and kill insects and he'd come home and just watch movies and drink milkshakes. And that same person that would just sit on the couch and drink milkshakes, a few years later is running 100-mile races. He's like we're not even tapping into our potential. That's something I definitely believe, and I think reading all these books definitely reinforces that. But I just thought it was fascinating that we had this huge -- I mean, World War II was the largest war in human history, in our species history, and you had people doing extreme things to meet an extreme demand. So it kind of illustrates that in a small way, not a small way, meaning the magnitude of what they're doing, but like a small amount of time, I should say. So this is a failed -- another -- one of the failed coups against Olive. It says, as events unfolded, Walter and Olive Ann both wound up at the same time in the same hospital. So he winds up -- Walter has like something called encephalitis, which is a painful affliction of the joint call – in like your spine. It’s like you have inflammation in the brain, you have headaches, stiffness of the neck, you can die from this. He doesn't die from it, but he dies from a heart attack shortly thereafter. But it says, as events unfolded, Walter and Olive Ann both wind up in the same hospital at the same time. She was in the hospital to deliver their second daughter, Mary Lynn, that's the person who wrote the introduction that I referenced earlier. With both Beeches out of action, a dangerous power vacuum developed at Beech headquarters. Remember this is not only are they both in the hospital, but they're having -- their company is growing exponentially. And lower-level executives move to fill it. They mounted a corporate coup, and it appears that they had support for it in high places.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So what does that mean? It says the company's Eastern bankers wondered whether Beech Aircraft could survive without Walter, so did the reconstruction Finance Corp. These are all the companies that are granting them loans during -- for the wartime expansion, which had granted the company large loans to get to war work started. But the plotters made the fatal mistake of underestimating Olive Ann. This woman was gangster. Even while in the hospital, she had taken the precaution of having a direct line installed to Beech headquarters. It says, “Meanwhile, word reached Mrs. B that one of her new executives were saying that Walter would never come back, and he knew just a right replacement, himself. Mrs. Beech ordered the self-promoter and 13 other new men fired.” This is more about Olive Ann during the war years. During the war years, Olive Ann worked 10 to 12-hour days. In addition to everything else, she took her turn a volunteer coup of women workers who call themselves the Guardettes joining them as they kept an eye for any saboteurs who might threaten the factory complex at nights. And in a particularly insightful one-sentence mention of her personality, this article that they're writing about Beech at this time, it says, “Her genius lies in commanding respect. She had an instinctive talent for managing money and when necessary, finding more of it.” So the note I left myself on the next page was, "Tough times don't last tough people do." Oh, I guess I should tell you, I think Walter has already died at this point, if I'm not mistaken. Just as the company's war time buildup turned out to be a short-term liability, but a longer-term opportunity. And you'll see what I mean by like they knew they were going to get through tough times if they adapt and they could find like creative solutions out, which is what I'm about to read you here. And they realized that they're not going to have to do this forever because eventually, things will return -- the regress to the mean or they'll get a little easier. And it required Beech -- to vast experience as a manufacturing facility to the point that the company now has considerable more capacity than they could utilize immediately. So this is after the war. On the other hand, the government mandate buildup enabled Beech to expand in favorable government loans. So that's a good thing, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

However, despite its best efforts, Beech Aircraft did lose money in both 1946 and 1947, so Walter, is not dead yet. Scratching for business wherever it could be found, the company entered one of the most unusual periods in its history. It started producing an array of products that had nothing at all to do with aviation. This is what I mean about being good and resourceful, not just wasting money. As a subcontractor, Beech built vending machines, metal pie plates, refrigerator components, and even the great American corn harvester. The company also began to design an automobile. So they're just trying to find any kind of opportunity to sell products to utilize their excess capacity that they had in the factory. Of course, as soon as World War II is over, the government is not going to be buying 50,000 planes a year. Okay. All right. So now we're at the point where -- we're at the point, this is – we’re in the 1950s because he dies in 1950. Okay. Yes, I think he's dead by now. All right. So something that's integral in understanding Olive is she -- well, first of all, the one quality she demanded above all else was loyalty, but there was not -- there was very little -- I'm going to just say from my reading, I don't think she believed in shades of gray. You're either with her or against her. She's kind of ruthless to this aspect. So you can't be partially loyal. You were either loyal or you were gone. So there's a number of which said now this is Bill Beech. This is -- okay, so Walter's brother, R.K., okay? He tried to do a coup after Walter died, and she disappears him is how the book describes it. So she kicks him out the company, which is her husband's obviously brother. His son, Bill Beech, years later is talking about this. And he says, there were a number of people who went to dad, which is her husband's brother, right? And essentially, they said, a woman can't run this company.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Bill Beech said in an interview for this book. He laughed. Well, that proved wrong, didn't it? R.K. Beech, that's the uncle, was similarly forced out and became a kind of nonperson within the company. So it's kind of a crazy ruthless aspect of a personality. Not only like she erased you from company history, but no one would be allowed to talk about you again. It was kind of crazy. So this is the son again. It says, “For me growing up in the Beech family -- this is a different son, this guy's name is Walter. But he says, “For me growing up in the Beech family was always very confusing and more than a little intimidating. There was this hierarchy of power that was always in play, and Olive Ann, of course, set at the top of the mountain.” He says, "I was aware from an early age that people could disappear from the family. Once they were gone, they were rarely if ever spoken of again.” Nothing seems to have dented Olive Ann quite self-assurance and her determination to lead the company. She had cofounded. So let's talk a little bit about our management style now that she's in complete control. She was crisp and direct, a woman who wasted little time on small talk, some woman after my own heart. Olive Ann said what she had to say, directed what she wanted done to be done, and didn't invite an extended discussion. She was just a force. You never took anything for granted with her. You always had to be at your best. It was her way or you could leave. This is another -- this is a stepson that also worked in the company. Beech Aircraft is very much a family-run business. She believed in hard work for herself and her employees and viewed hard work as a pleasure and a privilege in and out of itself. Her personal motto was "Slowly we go." She preferred a more incremental approach. I'm going to expound on this in a little bit. It's also something that she's criticized for, but in note I left myself, which I'll talk about in a little bit is, I'm not at all convinced that she didn't take the right approach. She gets criticisms she didn't. I might argue that she did.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

There was advantages to her incremental approach. It held down development costs and allowed the company to get maximum use out of existing manufacturing equipment. People did criticism that there was a serious downside to this incremental approach. It kept Beech Aircraft from fully embracing jets even as competitors returning to them in the 1960s and '70s, which I'll talk about more. So not only was she relentlessly resourceful, but she also taught her daughters. They had 2 daughters. Obviously, they don't have a father, the father dies and they're still young. They have an inheritance from their dad’s estate and the daughters get something like a $1.2 million or something like that. And it says Olive Ann used the trust fund as a way of teaching her 2 daughters about investment and money. They'd always enjoyed their vacations in the mountains in Colorado. Now she suggested that they together find and buy a vacation cabin in their own names. They did. Eventually, Mary Lynn became sole owner. And as of 2009, the cabin continued to be in family ownership more than half a century after its initial purchase. So this is something interesting now, something at the time. So they make $4.8 million in profits, right? But this is before taxes. And they had -- at the time, they had this thing called a wartime excess profits tax. Imagine this being able to be passed today. And I'm not saying it should have been. But I think World War II is the one example of like everybody making sacrifices where now there's a lot of countries that can fight wars and the citizens don't even know what's going on. It's kind of the opposite of what? Like if you're going to fight a war and if you're going to go overseas and kill people, I think like people should have to -- like citizens should have to sacrifice for that. So it says, this wartime excess profits took away, I guess, it's almost like a 75% tax, total taxes took a bite of $3.1 million.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So they made $4.8 million. They had to pay massive tax and it was $1.8 million. So she hits a crisis. As -- I wrote -- I don't -- sometimes I confuse myself with notes, a crisis as I read from her personal notes, Royce and Banana Republic. I was talking about my -- I love the fact that companies and I wish everybody did this, where they take notes about their processes of how they think about their products, about how they do customer, how they support their customers, and I wish like every company publish these documents because I think they're so valuable. And so what I was referencing myself is that what I referenced earlier, how Royce took -- Henry Royce took such notes that it turned in a book and how Banana Republic -- the founders of Banana Republic did the same thing. All right. So anyways, this is -- she's going to a crisis and this is 1954 -- 1953. Okay. So it says “Finally, there are some maxims embodying the power of positive thinking and common sense,” this is something that's very important to us. She says, "Success is a sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out. Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off the goal. He who thinks by the inch and talks by the yard should be removed by the foot. Happiness is a matter of habit, gather it fresh every day or you may never get it at all. You can't have rosy thoughts about the future when your mind is full of blues about the past." Now remember, she's running a hugely complicated enterprise. Her husband, somebody she's known for maybe 20 years, the father of her children dies unexpectedly. And she's having to deal with this. And we're kind of seeing what's going on internally. Like how is she able to survive this? It says in the fall of 1953 and continuing to 1954, the pace and volume of her entry suddenly intensified. She was struggling with her biggest corporate crisis since becoming Beech CEO.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The crisis moves into an even more dangerous phase when the banks seem to be losing faith in Beechcraft. So not only she had to deal with internal coups from underlings, but banks are trying to basically cut her off. It was a bad time, a November entry reads simply, "Trying days.” It was followed by a December entry that reads, "Road roughens." Immediately following this entry, she wrote that unidentified someone mentioned bankruptcy, "My hair turned red." This is evident in another entry that reads, visited -- so she's making some progress, "Visited with National City and Fourth National Bank of Wichita again." She's deciding to replace the bankers that are giving her all this trouble, making good progress, working towards goal. By April, she could elatedly declare victory, “Happy day, telegram of cancellation of V-loans sent to First National New York.” So before they could knock her out, she does the actual knockout blow and says we're prepaying everything and this telegram is basically saying, hey, we're going to prepay and then you need to consider this telegram like the end of our business relationship. We want nothing to do with you anymore because they weren't supporting her during tough times. Olive Ann celebrated this occasion which remember -- I bring this up because, one, this goes on for almost a year. And two, like from the outside, okay, the company is making millions of dollars or they're doing tens of millions of dollars in sales. Everything seems -- from the outside it might appear everything is okay. But people are not -- we -- as a species, we tend to broadcast the things that are going well and hide the things that are going bad. Everybody has bad things that are happening to them. Don't be fooled, don't be brainwashed into this. Like this is very important to understand that Beech Aircraft is undoubtedly a success. It's a successful company until it winds up being sold. Like for its entire existence, it was successful, but it doesn't mean it was easy. That doesn't mean every time was bad. And I think that people need to understand that.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says -- remember, I told you to remember the term coup de main. So it says, “Olive Ann celebrated the occasion which seems to have caught First National by surprise in many ways and for a good long time.” Coup de main, she exalted in her diary. She had written the term in her diaries a number of times over the years, it's almost like she's just manifesting it. Now she had pulled off a coup de main in reality. So the author continues. “If there was times where her first fierce determination flagged and it is almost certain that there were little evidence of those times appear and her diaries beyond those entries,” meaning the interest that I just read to you. "Steel true, blade straight" in which she's almost -- she wrote that over and over again, in which she almost seems to be talking to herself summoning up her courage. Only occasionally do self-out surfaces in this entry a speech, a good one I wrote, but I'm afraid I won't be able to give a justice for why I don't have the answer. So this part reminded me of one of the documentary I'd recommend anybody into entrepreneurship should watch, it's on HBO, it's called The Defiant Ones and I don't know if you know who Jimmy Iovine was. I've heard his name, but I didn't know much about him until I watch the documentary and he's one of these people that have just insane careers that don't make any sense. Like he starts out kind of like a loser, winds up getting a job at a recording studio, answering the phones, becomes a producer at 22, 23 years old, starts working with people like Bruce Springsteen and John Lennon. Has massive hits as a producer, then founds Interscope Records who in the first few years of its existence, it becomes one of the most successful record companies of all times, signs people like Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, Tupac, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, goes on to found Beats by Dre with Dr. Dre, sells it a few years later for $3 billion to Apple. Anyways, he has this really -- I think maybe his most important idea is his idea about fear and this is what Olive Ann is experiencing here in her diary entry.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And he says, I'm just going to read this quote that I took notes on one time. He said, “You need to learn to turn fear into a tailwind instead of a headwind. Fear is as powerful as the force. If you can harness it, it is an asset; and you will have a big, big advantage. That has been my whole thing.” And this is what I mean the most important idea, I think he had -- that I've heard from him. “When I feel fear, I have trained myself to move forward. The fight is never over with fear. It has never gone. You have to harness it.” So specifically, that one sentence when you feel fear, you have to train yourself to move forward. Understand that everybody feels fear, it's completely natural to the human experience. But what's unnatural is going forward in the face of fear. And so that’s what he is talking about. Like for many people, when they feel fear, it's tailwind, it pushes them back, it stops them, and slows them down. Jimmy is like, no, no, no. One thing I did is I learned -- I use it as fuel to speed me up, to get me to where I'm going. So I think it's important. So this gives you an idea of the scope of the organization she was running. Beech now counted more than 40 ongoing projects ranging from contracts and subcontracts for both commercial and military aircraft. They had advanced secret research projects in Aerospace and the company's annual report for the fiscal year ending September 30, recorded revenues of nearly $104 million. More maxims and it says the hallmark, this is something in her diary, "The hallmark of the adult is that he is willing to pay for what he wants. Also, he knows the cost." And the note I scribbled to myself when I read it was like, I wonder what was going on in her mind when she wrote that. So I always talk about this idea, books are original links. I explained at the beginning of the podcast, Kirk Kerkorian and the book on his life linked me to Olive Ann and the book on her life. And now I just found another book. So I've heard -- you've heard -- you've probably heard the term Learjet, right? I heard the term, don't know much about it. I had no idea that is named after the person that started the company, Bill Lear. So this is an example of this book now linking me to him. I've already put -- found some biographies on him. I just got to figure out which one I'm going to read, so he'll eventually pop up in a new founders’ episode eventually. And you'll see why because he's a misfit, he's a rebel, he's a mad man, he's a crazy person which I love to study. It says, Bill Lear is typically described as a man you could hate one minute and love the next. But this wasn't the case with Olive Ann. She thoroughly disliked him all of the time.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But Bill Lear was a genius. There's absolutely no doubt about that. And this is what I mean, like, what wait till what I'm going to read you right now. “He's credit with more than 150 inventions, including the car radio, the 8-track stereo tape player and the auto pilot for jet air pack -- for jet aircraft, but his best-known creation of all was the Learjet. How do you do -- it would take – typically, it would take a person multiple lifetimes to do all that. That's insane. He invented the car radio, the 8-track stereo player, autopilot and the Learjet. The Learjet was his mass produced and expensive and speedy business jet. When he came to Wichita in 1962, he had been refining the Learjet design for 3 years. Now he was ready to build. What irritated her, Olive most about Lear? He soon began hiring away Beech engineers. So he hires away one of her friends, and she just couldn't believe it. He says, “Ms. Beech just couldn't believe that anyone would leave Beech for another company.” So he hires away Jim Greenwood, and that's whose quote I just referenced. And this is hilarious, her response later on. Because again, there's no what I referenced earlier. There's no black and white like –there's no gray. It's black or white. You're Jim, you're on my team. Now you're off my team, so you're dead to me. One day, Greenwood as a Learjet employee bumped into her on a commercial flight. “Hello, Mrs. Beech,” Greenwood ventured. “Oh, Mr. Greenwood,” Olive Ann replied. “If I had known that you were going to be on this flight, I would have tried to think of something nice to say to you.” I read that and it make me chuckle. I think it's hilarious.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. So Lear starts this company. The first year he gets $52 million in sales, the first year. And so what happens is everybody -- they're making these like a little, I don't know, I guess you call them turboprops is what everybody was flying before that they introduced in the jet. And so, this is where people were saying like, slow we go, incremental approach was -- like people thought it was detrimental. I'm, again, not at all convinced that this wasn't the wrong -- like this was the wrong strategy. I think if I was in her shoes at this point in the company history, I would have done the exact same thing. I think it was the smarter thing to do actually. I think the criticism she's getting is wrong. And so I guess before I tell you -- like the criticism, what the -- I should tell you what the criticism was. The criticism was that she was too slow to embrace the new trend in the industry and create an entire new. She wanted to incrementally approve the existing product line and not scratch everything they're doing in building a jet, which is a completely different product, right? And at this point, Beech Aircraft has been around for almost 30 years. The 2 co-founders that created most of the products were her husband, he's dead and the engineer who's -- he's not -- he was the other cofounders, he was not really involved in the companies, he’s like off sailing. He had like a love of sailings, was writing sailing textbooks and those other stuff. And like are you going to put your company in a precarious financial position? Like I understand what their point is, the future is jets, if you don't embrace the trend for jets, right, then you're going to miss out on that. But it's also like there's a lot of businesses that have like staying power. So you might not have this huge growth. They might not be doing $52 million in sales the first year, but you're also competing with a company that was created from its foundation to build jets as opposed to taking a huge organization, kind of trying to turn the ship around on a dime and do an entirely new product line. Like -- and the reason I bring that up is like, okay, so let me read this part, and let me tell you why.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And why -- so this is her reasoning. She goes with the cost of developing them, meaning the new like incremental approach for the turboprops or whatever you want to call them, with the cost of developing them already pretty much written off a large percentage of each sale flowed right down to the bottom line is profit. On the other hand, the Learjet appeared to be the wave of the future. And so this is how the corporate history pits this decision. Compared with peer jet power, the turboprop offered many advantages, great savings in initial and operating costs, so they're cheaper, ability to operate anywhere without limiting noise factors, safe, easy, fast transition for the pilot accustomed to handling propeller-driven, piston-powered aircraft. And the executive who like to take over the control himself would have little that was new to learn to handle the company's -- the name of the product is called King Air, with the proficiency of a veteran professional. Building the King Air turboprop was another example of Olive Ann's slowly-we-grow approach, and it proved to be a highly profitable decision. Within 90 days of the initial announcement of the new model, advanced deposits for future deliveries already totaled $10.8 million. This is just the beginning. The King Air turboprop would be in continuous production for the next 4-1/2 decades. And as of 2009 was still in production. So she got a lot of -- this is maybe her most criticized decision. It's like, oh, you missed this huge wave. She even had a chance to buy Learjet and wouldn't because she hated that guy. But what I thought of when -- so as I'm reading about like the back and forth and like the pros and cons of the decision, it may be think of there's a quote by Charlie Munger that I came across in the Tao of Charlie Munger. And I'm going to read it to you. And it says, "Over the very long term, history shows that the chances of any business surviving in a manner agreeable to a company's owners are slim at best." So that -- in light of that decision, given the competition and the size of the company and what their expertise was, I think it was the right decision.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This decision I would have made. I would have tried to increase profitability and understood that like the -- like you're not -- you're better off managing what you're good at already than trying to do something new. I know there's other companies that have succeeded somewhat, Amazon, of course, being the outlier there, that they started off selling books online. They had this huge retail business and then because of their dedication experimentation and their skill set, they now have a bunch of other hugely profitable businesses, AWS being one example. But in this case, you have a 60-year-old CEO. All the good product people are gone. Like, yes, of course, you optimize what you already have. There's still a market there. So a lot of people are like, Learjet looks good because it’s got $52 million in sales. It got $52 million of sales because jets are a lot more expensive than turboprop planes. And you have an entire market that is not looking at jets, and you already have like you're a standard bearer for quality and excellence in this turboprop industry. And what you just said? Let me go back to that quote real quick. Cost of research and development, right, cost development was already written off at this point. So a large percentage of each sales flowed right down to the bottom line. This was the smart financial decision. It's like she's been criticized for not competing with them. If she competes with them, she would've lost. And then -- so, okay, you compete with them, right? You lose and now you're company's at a precarious financial position, you go bankrupt. How is that smarter? Sometimes you have to know, hey, what Charlie Munger said, everything -- we're temporary beings, I talk about this the whole time. But not only are we temporary, the businesses are temporary. The businesses, your business, the business you want to do, the business that you might start in the future, maybe one you ran in your past, maybe not even running business, maybe businesses you admire.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Like you usually have 1 or 2 really good products, good ideas, and you live off that. That's successful. There's nothing wrong with it. This idea that we have to constantly like throw everything away and not constantly, like I don't buy that. I don't think it's a good idea. It just did not make sense. I did not -- when I'm reading this like, I don't understand this criticism, what do you expect this person to do? And then wind up being like this company survives. Winds up merging with Raytheon, like she winds up her -- the stock for the Beechcraft Air owners, shareholders rather, it goes up like 4, 5x in wake of that merger, like she did a good job. I don't understand this criticism. It's like this fake world where -- the criticism sounds like this fake world where we know what the future is and it's all predictable and the ideas are going to work out like let's say, if we're not awash in a sea of chaos, like that's ridiculous. All right. So now I want to fast forward to the end when she actually steps down at 76 years old. Before I get into that, I just want to remind you, as you've seen, I don't -- I presented this podcast ad free. My business model is very simple. I give half of my podcast away for free. The people that want to get the other half, they're available on what I call the Misfit Feed. The Misfit Feed comes from that famous Apple app, it's called Here's to the Crazy Ones. It starts out like here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in square holes. I just think it's a better name than just saying subscriber or whatever case is. Anyways, usually podcasters like, oh, please sign up and support like me, the podcast. You're doing that. But honestly, like by accessing these other podcasts that are available nowhere else, first and foremost, you're supporting yourself, and then secondary, hopefully, you enjoy my work and you're learning from it and you're supporting me.

So if at all, if you're learning from this and you want to get more and support the ongoing production of these podcasts, please look at -- there's a link below. You tap it within -- I've put a stopwatch on this like, I think, 10 to 20 seconds, maybe 10 to 30 seconds from the time you tap that link to the time that the private fee is automatically installed in your podcast player of choice and you can be listening to the Misfit Feed, the exclusive podcast that are available nowhere else. Okay. So back to Olive Ann Beech real quick. It says this was an article, talks about referencing her stepping analysis. An aviation era, the independent reign of Olive Ann Beech, 76, the last founder of a major -- founder and manager of a major aircraft firm is coming to an end. The quiet small-town Kansas girl, who cast her lot 55 years ago with Walter Beech, a sometimes rockets ex-army pilot and barnstormer has made her biggest decision. Often called the First Lady of Aviation by Beech Publishers, Olive Ann Beech is praised by both supporters and detractors with such comments as she thinks she's indestructible, and maybe she is. Beech is the last of the builders started during Aviation's golden years of the 1920s and early 1930s, that still is controlled and run by a founder or immediate family member. And then I want to close on this, which actually hit me in the heart when I read it, I was really sad. I'm not trying to make you sad, but these -- fundamentally, like the story of companies stem from the story of people, the founders that started the company, the people that worked there, the customers that buy the product, they get -- all of it is a story of people. We can't lose sight of that. So this is her nephew talking. “She no longer seems intimidating to me. And by that time, I had grown very fond of her. I remember one New Year's Eve, 1987, I believe, when on a whim, I decided to drop by her house and wish her a happy new year. We sat in her breakfast room, drank strong coffee, and talked. She seemed generally pleased that I'd come by. I think I stayed for at least an hour. It was one of those few times, if not the only time that I ever just sat alone with her and talked casually and openly without the family or a bunch of other people around. It remains one of my fondest memories of Aunt Ann.

In her final years, I remember how sad I felt watching her decline, watching the once towering presence become a little old lady, watching her sharp mind and sharp wit fade. I've seen the same thing happen to many other people. But in Aunt Ann, it seemed particularly poignant given the imposing presence she had once been in my life. I carry part of Olive Ann with me to this day. I think she said to me and to others, her sense of taste and dignity, her generosity, and as I've grown older, I discovered the deep wisdom that lies in her simple life motto, slowly we go.” Her life and now skipping ahead this about 5 years later, “Her life ended peacefully at her home on the morning of July 6, 1993. She simply slipped away in her sleep. She was gone now. The small-town girl with bangs and a determined gaze, the slender young woman with fashion model looks, the corporate executive who brooked no nonsense, the wife and mother of 2, the elegant first lady of aviation who blazed a trail for other women to follow, she had forged her life, molded into a shape of her choosing by sheer strength of will. No one can make you feel inferior without your consent, she had reminded herself in her desk diary in a phrase that had become her guidepost, and no one ever did.

So that is where I'll leave the story. If you want to learn more as normal, this is -- these are just the highlights and notes I took. It's tiny, tiny part of the book. There's so much more to learn. I might even do -- Walter seems like a crazy guy too to do a podcast, and maybe I'll do a podcast on him in the future. I'm not sure. But if you want to buy the book and support the podcast -- so first of all, if you want to support yourself by buying the book, you get something interesting to read. You support the author for taking all the time and effort to write books that we can all learn from and then you support me and podcast because there's a link below or you can just go to amazon.com/shop/founderspodcast. It's what's known as an Amazon affiliate link. If you click -- if you buy a book using that link, Amazon sends a small percentage of the sale to me at no additional cost. To you, it's a way to passively basically support the podcast. And more importantly, to support yourself because there's very few activities that better use of your time other than spending time with family, taking care of your health, and working than reading. And it's just a fantastic, beautiful book. I got the hardcover, tons of pictures. There’s even some pictures of Olive Ann and here with Walt Disney, which I particularly enjoyed, pictures of their products. Just an amazing -- and one I don't think I'll forget.

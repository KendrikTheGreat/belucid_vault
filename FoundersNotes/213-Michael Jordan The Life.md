So let's go back to this. "There's no shortcuts. I've always believed in leading with action, not words. And I learned very early to follow my instincts." This is, again, these ideas he's going to repeat over and over again. "My standards have always been mine alone. I've never tried to live up to the expectations of others, and everybody knows the results. This book is about the process. The values that form the foundation of my playing career are the same values that define Brand Jordan. I truly believe those values never go out of style." So that he sets the very beginning of the book saying -- asking a question, will there be another Michael Jordan? "Sure. There is no doubt a player will come along who will be able to build on what I have accomplished just as I built on the example of great players before me." And then he talks a little bit about like the growth of the NBA and the game since he's retired. And that there's a -- obviously, it's way more successful as a business in general, a lot more fans. And so the rewards, the players are not only larger, but they come quicker. And he's not sure that's actually beneficial. So he's saying, "there wasn't a lot of corporations looking to invest in young NBA players in 1984. It's often the other way around today," meaning that you could have -- he had to prove that he had the ability to play and then he got the rewards. He's saying that they're being players today are being rewarded on future potential. And that -- this is his opinion on why that could be potentially detrimental. "It's often the other way around today, which makes it a lot harder for young NBA players to realize the depth of their potential. It's hard to spend all summer working on 1 aspect of your game when you've already received the payoff. I never had that problem." And so now he's going to go into, like, what motivated him. "I wanted to prove what I could do." This is something he repeats over and over again, too. "When my play started providing me with the rewards, then I wanted to prove, I deserve them.

His relentless determination produced 6 NBA championships and some of the most spectacular performances in sports history, while his enduring grace and unique sense of style made him equally famous in the worlds of fashion, business and marketing. In Driven from Within, Michael makes it clear that the basis for his phenomenal success came from the inside out, thanks in part to those who guided him along the way. His skill, work ethic, philosophy, personal style, competitiveness and presence have flowed from the basketball court and into every facet of his life. Nearly 3 years removed from his last turn as an athlete, Michael's 20th Air Jordan Shoe has helped push Nike's Brand Jordan division to nearly $500 million in sales. This is a book about the power of collaboration and teamwork. The all-inspiring energy generated when people combine their creativity and passion and a fearless desire to lead, whether it's waking up at 6 a.m. to work on fundamentals as a high school junior or spending hours with legendary designer, Tinker Hatfield, on the intricacies of state-of-the-art shoe design. Michael Jordan has never wavered in his desire to be the best. Everyone knows the results. In Driven from Within, Michael Jordan and those in his inner circle revealed the philosophy that made it all happen.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So that is from the inside cover of the book that I'm going to talk to you about today, which is Driven from Within and it was written by Michael Jordan and Mark Vancil. So I was not expecting to do this book right now. It's actually 200 pages into another book that hopefully will come in the next few days. But ever since I read that almost 700-page biography of Michael Jordan, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Just the ability to look into Michael Jordan's mindset and operating system really motivated me and really fired me up actually. And so I had read like briefly the introduction to this book. It sounds like, you know what, I need to do this right now. I feel compelled to, I can't put this book down. So in the last few days, not only did I finish reading -- I read this entire book, but also would go on YouTube and every free moment whether I'm washing the dishes, I'm in the car, I'm going for a walk, whatever I've been doing, I've been looking up videos and listening to Michael Jordan speak, not videos about Michael Jordan, but literally downloading into my mind as much as I could, just him talking. And that is what also this book because most of it -- there's a couple like little -- he calls them vignette, little stories from people like his mom, some of his oldest friends, the shoe designer, Tinker Hatfield, that he's worked with for 20 years on the Jordan Shoe and his main business. But the vast majority of what I'm going to share with you today is just straight from the words of Michael Jordan. And then you and I will have the ability to download his mindset straight from him. And there's some ideas that I've learned from both these books that I don't think I'm going to forget. And I'll make sure I'll point them out to you as we run over them today. So this is Michael talking like, why does this book exist and what it's about? And what I'm about to read to you, remember, he is talking -- he's not talking about his playing career, he's talking about his business. And what's fascinating, so this book is almost, what, 20 years old, something like that. And I think it's a great illustration of what a lot of these other great minds that you and I have been studying, they always tell us to never interrupt the compounding, that it's hard for our minds to grasp that all the profits are far into the future. So 20 years ago, it's already a Jordan Brand, which he refers to as -- so in the book, he'll call it Brand Jordan. In modern day, he says is a Jordan Brand. So I don't want you to get confused about that, but I'm going to read it as it appears in the book, which is Brand Jordan. But the Jordan Brand, over 20 years ago, was doing $500 million of sales, fantastic business, right? You fast forward 20 years in the future, he did not interrupt that compounding, and now they're doing 7x that amount, $3.6 billion a year.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So let's go to this. It says no one -- and remember, he's talking about the business, "No one could have predicted the outcome because I was never following someone's lead or operating off an existing model. There were no models for what happened at Nike." As you’ll remember, if you listened to the podcast I just -- the previous podcast. When he signs at Nike, they're doing $25 million a year in revenue and a large endorsement contract for an athlete at the time would be like $100,000. So he says, "there was no models for what happen at Nike, and certainly nothing close to what we have created with Brand Jordan." Looking back -- so again, this is why the book exists and what it's about. "Looking back isn't about celebrating the results as much as it is about understanding the process that produced those results. It's been about leading and staying true. Authentic to those fundamental values that flow downstream from my parents and later, coach Dean Smith," as his college coach at UNC. "Moving through the business world full time, I recognize that the structure of success is no different there than it was on the basketball court. Great companies have a lot in common with great teams. Players who practice hard when no one is paying attention will play well when everyone is watching." And so right there, his -- what really surprised me is his complete dedication to practice, how much he talks about it over and over again. And that is one of the main ideas I learned from Jordan that I don't think I'll ever forget. It was so surprising to me, and it's something he's going to repeat over and over again. You know what, it just struck me when I was reading the inside cover to you a few minutes ago. And I didn’t make the connection until -- for whatever reason, it's popped in my mind there. But if you go back, like you'll see -- I've done an extensive amount of reading and studying of people like Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett are the 3 that popped in my mind, over decades of their career, right? And what's fascinating to me is how much they have a handful of ideas that they repeat over decades. Jordan shares that trait with them. There's a lot of things that he's saying when he's 35, when he's 40, that he's still repeating when he's almost 60 years old today.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I never felt the desire to rest on what I had accomplished. I never felt like I deserve to drive a Bentley when I got my first contract or live in a mansion." There’s actually a story I'm going to share with you later in the book, which talks about his -- it really surprised me how financially conservative he was. I was not expecting that from him. And it's actually kind of phony what motivates him to be so conservative, too, because just he was terrified, the idea of ever having to get an actual job. Those things might be symbols of success to some people, but there are a lot of people who confuse symbols with actual success. What's left after you got all the money and buy the best car? There's nowhere to go from there. And so his point is like I just focus on achievement, and I knew that the financial rewards would come from that achievement. When we won 1 championship, I wanted to win 2 in a row. When we went 2, I wanted to win 3 in a row because of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson had never won 3 straight. Nothing of value comes without being earned. So I guess just to pause here. All -- everything I'm reading right now is coming right after -- one right after another. There's not really a narrative for the book. What I really feel is like so it goes in order of like the design and the shoes, goes through like their thought process, the growth of the business as a result of all this. But really, the way to think about this book is just Jordan, just speaking freely, like off the cuff like if you're having a conversation with a friend just downloading into your brain, everything he learned from his -- not only his playing career but building the brand and giving you his mindset and operating system himself. So he's saying nothing of value comes without being earned. We're going to get into his motto, which he got from his high school coach, which I think is fantastic, but he talks a lot about the fact that he looked at himself as a leader. He says, "that's why great leaders are those who lead by example first. You can't demand respect because of a title or position and then expect people to follow you. That might work for a little while, but in the long run, people respond to what they see. I practiced hard every day because I wanted everyone of my teammates to know what I expected out of myself. If I took a day off, then I know they would, too. Just like my high school coach used to say, it's hard, but it's fair. I live by those words."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then a few pages later. He just got this great sentence, which really is just sort of an echo of this idea that you and I have talked about over and over again that the score takes care of itself. Another rather surprising thing I learned about Jordan. He just focus on being as good -- as great at his craft as possible, and he knew if he did that, then he'd get the rewards he deserved. "I figured if I was good as I could be at playing sports, eventually, it would pay dividends. I didn't know how. But my main focus -- excuse me, my focus was to be the best player in whatever sport I played. That's all I ever thought about." So at this point in the book, is still reflecting on his early life. This is about what his dad -- like we talked in the last podcast that the fact that as dad told him, you're not good at anything, go in the house with the women, get out of here like really burned like an extreme sense of like motivation in him. And so there's 2 main ideas. He's going to -- I'm going to start this page on him talking about his father's opinion of him when he was a kid. But really, the thing about Jordan, I think is 2 -- he's got 2 really good ideas on this page that he shares with other people. I'm going to -- the shorthand on the note I left myself was have 1 speed, go. That is something I learned from Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari and Chuck E. Cheese. He was a mentor or Steve Jobs, hired a 19-year-old Steve Jobs. And he said he's like, "when I gave Steve Jobs at job at Atari, like he did, there was no -- he had 1 speed. He was all out all the time." And then this really -- the second idea really surprised me not because of the idea behind it but because he was -- he said it explicitly, and this is an idea you and I have talked about over and over again that if you want to be truly great at something, find work that feels like play. So this is Jordan on his dad. "He didn't think I had amount to anything because I had no hand skills and no mechanical skills. The way my father looked at it, there was no guarantee I'd be able to make a living." Remember, they're just like a normal, maybe lower middle-class country family in Wilmington, North Carolina.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So his idea -- his dad's idea is like you have to be able to -- if you're a mechanic, you can always fix things for other people, then at least you're guaranteed some kind of way to make a living and to support yourself and your family, right? So he's like, "that's what I did, that's what you should do because I know hand skills on mechanical skills. That's way my father looked at it. There was no guarantee I'd be able to make a living. So if you didn't have those skills, nobody guarantee I'd be able to make a living, but I never thought about that. All my energy was focused on getting where I had to go," and Jordan talks about one of the motivations to that. "I wanted the freedom to do what I wanted to do, and I wanted to do it my way." To this day, and this is shocking because Jordan is widely known for one of the greatest work ethics of any sports -- any player in sports in any sport ever, right? And – but he’s saying, "to this day, I don't enjoy working. I enjoy playing and figuring out how to connect playing with business. To me, that's my niche. People talk about the work ethics of a player, but they don't understand what appear to be hard work to others was simply playing for me. We were playing a game. Why not play as hard as you can?" And so on this page his mom is talking about stories from his childhood that the sentence might be surprising, right? "Michael wouldn't have done anything if we didn't remind him, not -- when he came to sports, but just doing chores, going for a job. He would have laid around and looked at the TV all day." And so I think a lot of people have that problem like, oh, I don't feel motivated. So you're probably a driven individual in general. You just pick the wrong profession. If there's somebody out there that has to -- dragging themselves out a bed like, "Oh, c_*_, I don't want to go do what I'm about to do," then to find something else to do. If you told Jordan, "hey, I got to go work as a mechanic, I got to go sit in office from 9 to 5 and answer e-mails." These are examples he's actually used in conversations. And I think they also appear in this book. He's like, "to me, that's torture. I have to force myself to do those things I wouldn't work very hard at them" But he would say, "Hey, I have an opportunity to make -- to be a pro athlete, and I will work from the time my eyes open in the morning till I go to bed at night, and no one will have to push me from behind."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But what's interesting is it wasn't always this way. So that leads me into the next section where this is about its first mentor and a constant desire to improve its skills. And this is - excuse me, his high school coach. So it's got named Coach Herring. Coach Herring is the guy that gave him that life motto. It's hard, but it's fair. "Coach Herring was the first one to see in me what I saw and myself. He picked me up every morning my junior year, took me to the gym before school and worked me out. He was my pusher. He was one of the coaches who would just talk to you. You have to stay focused, MJ, you can't do this MJ, get your grades up, man, get your grades up. Most days, I enjoyed it. Some days, I didn't feel like going." Remember this whole idea about I didn't feel like doing it because he explicitly talks about your feelings don't matter. Business is about service to others. When he is playing, he feels it's his obligation. Somebody paid their heart -- they worked all week, they paid their hard-earned money to buy a ticket to watch me and to play to entertain them. And to that degree, I think it's smart to have a motivation that's bigger than yourself, right? But his point is, it doesn't matter if my knee hurts, my ankle hurts. I don't feel good. I have an obligation because I'm serving other people to go out and give my best effort. So most days I enjoyed it. Some days I didn't feel like going, but those are the days that Coach Herring would push me. Eventually, Michael is able to play that role for himself, right? He made this big old poster with all the drills listed, and we went through them every single day. That's how it got started. I wasn't a great athlete at the time, but I wanted to be. I wanted to be admired. I wanted to be respected. I wanted the girls to respect me, too. All of that drove me a lot more than most people think. I didn't have any status at the time. If that's what you saw, meaning I wasn't the best player, I wasn't excelling. I was going to prove you wrong. Just watch me. That was my mentality.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then he is an idea that I think is very -- again, surprising that he starts with low expectations and then he'll tell you over and over again, and you should be concentrating on the fundamentals. But what I found interesting is like he started with low expectations. But once he reach that low expectation, he didn't rest on his laurels, right? He picks on the next target. But as he's moving up that progression, he's building confidence. So let's go into that, you'll see what I mean. My expectations are very low. I wanted to be the best player at the park in Wilmington. Then I wanted to be better than my brothers or the guys in my neighborhood. These were my expectations. Then these are about the progression. Make the Varsity team in high school, impress the coach, get a 4-year scholarship to a major college with each -- and he ends that sentence there. But if you think about it, he's like, go to college, win a championship in college, try again and win a championship. Go to the NBA, spend 7 years training, win one. Then on win 2, then on win 3. And I was watching this other interview with him. And it was like real quick with a reporter, but they're like, "hey, you just won 3, isn't that enough?" He's like, enough for who? Might be enough for you, but he's like, no, there's always something else, something that's coming next. So he says with each progression, I gain confidence. Then he talks about what he learned from his college coach. Coach Dean Smith's system wasn't about excelling at 1 phase of the game. He was about excellence in every phase of the game, scoring, rebounding, passing, playing defense. And so part of the progression that had to occur to get him to the next level is the fact that his lies -- his high school coach lies to get them into a 5-star basketball camp. And before Jordan has just isolated in North Carolina, he doesn't know how good he is, but his coach sees other people playing. He's like, you can play with these guys. So he wants of lying, get them into the basketball camp. I'm not going to repeat stuff I already covered in the last podcast, but this was new information was the fact that the guy running the coach -- excuse me, running the camp was so impressed that originally, Michael was only supposed to stay for 1 week.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so the guy running the camp his name is Mr. Garfinkel, calls his parents and like, don't pick up, Michael. And so this is his mom, Michael's mom relaying the memory. Each week, we would sit -- they're talking about -- their finances were tight. They had to stick to a budget, stick to figure out which bills we can pay this week, which ones we can't. So we got this guy calling saying, "Hey, come, Michael needs to stay for a second week, we don't have the money for it." And this blew my mind. Each week, we would sit down and figure out what bills we were going to pay. We had paid for 1 week of basketball camp when Mr. Garfinkel called. We told them we only had 1 week -- 1 call to say, "Hey, Michael needs to stay for another week." This guy is like, you don't understand your son's going crazy. So it says he called, we told him we only had money in the budget for that 1 week. Mr. Garfinkel just let us have it. He told us we didn't know the skills of our son. I said, "sir, that's okay. We pay for 1 week, and we're coming to get him. He said, I'll give him the money. And then Michael jumps in and talks about what this camp gave to his confidence and his ability, "hey, I can play with the best people around. I'm as good as they can or actually, I'm as good as they are. I was full of energy after that second week. I thought I must be doing something right. All I wanted to do was to improve, to keep getting better. I became a sponge. I got a glimpse of what success looks like.” So I'm going to fast forward in the book. He's in Chicago, Rookie year right away, and he's like, okay, this guy is not playing. And so there's going to be some stories from friends, 2 different stories from 2 different people in here. Let me give you the first one. You couldn't help but notice this guy was different from all of us who were already there with the Bulls. His practice habits were unmatched. And so that's an easy -- that's the idea that repeats over and over again. It's an easy idea for you and I to use in whatever field that we're in, we just make the commitment. No one is going to prepare more than me. No one is going to practice more than me.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

His level of effort, his level of competing stood out. He always wanted to take it to the next level. If the other guys didn't take their effort up, then Michael had no problem embarrassing them. And so then we have another story in the same page from a different person. Really, the note I left myself on this page is practice -- combine practice, effort and education. You ever see Star Wars? Yoda is this little ugly thing, but he's the Jedi Master. He's the guy who taught everybody. Everybody went to Yoda for knowledge. When you sit around talking to any older person who's lived their life to the fullest, they have great stories to tell because they've had great experiences. Michael is Yoda. He's always been an old soul. That's probably attributable to the education that he got from his parents, the education he got from Dean Smith in college and then the education that he got in the Olympics with Bobby Knight. He was more mature than the average 21-year-old kid coming into the NBA. And you see that maturity, too, if you watch the Last Dance because his Rookie season -- think about it, you're a kid from a small town, now you're dropped into Chicago. You have a nice contract, not nearly like comparable to what athletes today make, but you're making a lot more money you've ever made in your life, you have more freedom. You have people even though at the time, I think they were like they didn't even sell half the arena in Chicago. But you have -- you probably feel good about yourself. He goes looking for his teammates one day, knocks on the hotel room, goes in and he sees most of the Bulls. Remember, the Bulls is a crappy team, a bunch of average players, not really serious about their craft. Goes in there. There's a bunch of girls, there's a bunch of alcohols, there’s bunch of people doing cocaine, and he just turns around, and he say, “All right, well, I'm leaving, I'm out." And so the maturity for a 21-year-old person to not give in to the temptations because those temptations would get in the way of what his goal in life was. That is very rare.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this next section is called Uncompromised. And I want to pull -- before I read this to you, I want to pull out -- I have a bunch of notes from these talks that I was listening to the last few days. One of them comes there's like this long, it's like an hour-long talk that's on YouTube, where Michael is just sitting down and being interviewed by the magazine, Cigar Aficionado, and they're talking about -- this is like 2 years before the Last Dance is released, and they hear the rumor, and they're like, well, it's not out yet, but he says -- Michael said something that was very interesting, I think, ties into this section of the book. He said, listen, if you're going to watch the Last Dance, it's going to show my unwavering dedication to the game. And really think that I think unwavering and uncompromised are similar ideas what he’s talking about here. Some players look at me for all the wrong reasons, marketing, admiration, money made off the court. They don't understand the foundation I had to create to support everything that came afterwards. They don't know about lifting weights at 7:00 a.m., practicing hard every day, finding ways to motivate myself for every game, sitting up half the night with an ankle in a bucket of ice or hooked up to an electronic stimulation machine. They don't know about any of those things. In a sense, my experience created a vision that obscured the hard work and commitment. With all the attention on the surface, it's easy to become confused about the source of the money and glamor. And the great maxim that I think would condense or distill what he's telling us there is the fact that the public praises people for what they practice in private. The public praises people for what they practice in private. They're seeing the money. They're seeing the private jet. They're seeing the commercials. They're seeing the championships. They don't see the hours of practice. The fact that I'm getting my knee drained. My ankle is messed up. I woke up at 7:00 a.m. this morning. I lifted weights before practice. I worked on drills after practice. And so he gets to his punchline here, "You have to be uncompromised in your level of commitment to whatever you are doing or it can disappear as fast as it appeared."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so he continues the theme, “Don't pay attention to the wrong things. Pay attention to the way I played the game. Pay attention to my passion. Pay attention to the idea of focusing on improvement every day. Pay attention to my commitment. Commitment cannot be compromised by rewards. Excellence isn't a 1-week or 1-year ideal. It's a constant.” “There will be days when you don't feel on top of your game, but your commitment remains constant, no compromises. Look around and just about any person or entity achieving at a high level has the same focus.” The morning after Tiger Woods rallied to beat Phil Mickelson at the Ford Championship in 2005, he was in the gym by 6:30 to work out. No lights, no cameras, no glitz or glamor, uncompromised. So something I learned that was surprising in this book is the fact that Jordan almost left Nike to set up another company. And it's just a few years into his career. So this is Jordan talking about it then I want to talk about -- then we have his agent, David Falk, talking about this time. And I love comparing the same die hard competitive spirit that Michael Jordan applied to his game, Phil Knight had that same competitive spirit in building Nike. And so it says, so when my contract was coming up, he came to us and said, so he's talking about there's 2 executives at Nike, Peter and Rob, that were really like Jordan liaisons to Nike. And so they went up dipping out and saying, "Hey, why don't we start our own company, your own equity that you can build the business." And so Jordan is talking about this. So when my contract was coming up, they came to us and said, "Let's go out on the edge, let's do something different. Let's start our own shoe company." Peter was our lead designer and I had worked very closely with them. And Rob was a very good friend of the family. And so Jordan is really about loyalty and personal relationships, so he was contemplating this. And so this is his agent talking about that. But Michael was at Nike, and it was becoming the most successful endorsement in the history of professional sports. To say that I was in shock would be an understatement of the century. First, I thought Rob was a really close friend. And to think that he would have done all this behind my back amazed me.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Second, starting your own company seems -- at this point, seems to kind of thing -- it is the kind of thing that seems really sexy, rather, and exciting to a client because they're not seeing the downside. I had a meeting with Michael's parents who were very, very competitive. And I said, "You don't understand. This is going to be like a World War III for Phil Knight, and Phil is a very competitive guy." That -- this is his number 1 talent leaving, and he's not going to say, no problem, you have my blessing. Take my number 1 endorser, good luck. Phil is a competitive guy. Nike wanted to take over the world. Michael wanted to take over the world of basketball. So that drive was mirrored from one another. They are parallel stories. And I love that, that stated explicitly because if you read -- I've read -- I have re-read Phil Knight's book, I don't know, like probably like 30 podcasts back or something like that. I did another episode on Shoe Dog. Now I've read 2 books on Michael. I've spent a long time studying him. I do believe like that is my understanding as well, and I'm glad it's stated explicit here. They are parallel stories. It's the same idea manifested in 2 different personalities in 2 different industries. So what they wind up doing here that's smart is they're using the other offer as a leverage. So David and his parents talk to Jordan out of doing this, but then they use that offer as a way to get equity and to actually get Brand Jordan. Nike put a big deal on the table that expanded our line, gave me more creative control. This is Jordan speaking here. Gave me more creative control and approval rights. Within Nike at a period, we were expanding a line when in essence, we were starting another company beneath the Nike umbrella. Rob and Peter understood my feeling. They told us to use what they were trying to do and to get what we wanted from Nike, and that's what we did. So then there's this great story about when Michael Jordan gets to meet Warren Buffett and gets to hang out with him, spent some time with him. And they really realize like this is a different animal, same beast, and it has to do with how they come about making their decisions.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I've always wanted to know what successful people used when they were evaluating a deal or making a decision. I was with Coca-Cola earlier in my career, and they would put me on a dog and pony show all over the country to meet bottlers. It would take almost 8 days. I'd go into supermarkets everywhere shaking hands. On one of those trips, I was in Omaha, Nebraska, and I had the opportunity to meet Warren Buffett. He invited me out on his boat. First of all, I don't like boats. Now this is the richest guy in the world of time and he's the largest shareholder of Coke. I said, "Mr. Buffett, I don't mean to offend you, but I'm afraid of boats." He said, "Don't worry, we have life jackets." I told him you're going to have to give me 2 to give me on that boat. And so then they have this decision or excuse me, this discussion. I asked him about his decision-making process. What do you think about when you're making your decisions? What is your thought process? And he says, whatever my gut tells me, that's what I do. And so Michael was like, "Oh, I'm the same way. I thought that was pretty wild because up until that point, I was just -- when you talk about making decisions, I was just asking myself, what do you feel? Once I made a decision, I didn't think about it again. It was strictly off gut. That's how I made the decision to go with David Falk. That's how I evaluate deals before I sign my contracts. I don't think about it again from that point forward. It's still amazing to me that given the decisions Warren Buffett makes and the money that transfers with those decisions that he still goes with his gut. I just felt good hearing that from a guy like him -- or excuse me, I just felt good hearing that from a guy like him. And so now we got to the part where I mentioned earlier how it was kind of surprising how financially conservative was. And so Tinker Hatfield, main designer, like he calls him his right-hand man and the Jordan Brand for the design of shoes, goes to visit Michael. He's a few years into his career. And he goes to his house, and he says, his first house after he got married was a normal place. It wasn't anything special whatsoever. And he was a major superstar by then.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

That was an interesting aspect to Michael. That reminded me because this is a great story. Bill Gates to go to visit Steve Jobs and they're working on a deal. And he goes to his house and Bill goes -- he sees like his house, he sees his family and Bill at the time had been living in, I think it's called like Xanadu or whatever his -- he's like a 60,000 square foot house on the Lake in Washington, right, that got a lot of like attention because there's like leading technology of its day and all this other stuff that he built into it. But he asked Steve Jobs, he goes, "do all of you live here? He couldn't believe he's like how relatively modest for the amount of wealth that Steve Jobs had, that he didn't need to feel to do the same what Bill was doing. So this is Michael talking about that. It's always been very conservative financially. That came from my advisers. And I listened to them because I was scared. You don't want to be like some of the guys at the end of their career with nothing to show looking for work. That was scary to me. The idea that at some point in time, I'd have to go get a job. I've seen a lot of people who had opportunities to be successful and wealthy, but they made critical mistakes. I pay attention to those things. Money never drove me. Sure, I wanted to be successful. I wanted the nicest things that success brings. But my passion was pure. The way I played and the way I go about things has never had anything to do with money. And part of this and motivate him more was the fact that even when he was in his early days of his career, his mom would repeat the story of Joe Lewis, I didn't know that. I heard the name Joe Lewis. I didn't know what she's about to tell us. I often told him about Joe Lewis, the Boxer. He died homeless. He didn't even have money to bury himself. He had no discipline and no direction. And then just a quick paragraph, 2 ideas that he repeats that I think are worth reiterating. One, blinders on focus. So just like when the horses, they put the horse on the -- blinders on the horses so they don’t look left and right. They just look forward to whatever their goal is. I think a lot of successful people in life have that mentality.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then does Steve Jobs quote that I repeat over and over again that reminds me of -- there's a lot of parallels between Steve Jobs and Michael Jordan. So it be a yard stick for quality. People are not used to an environment with excellence is demanded. So he's saying, I'm very secure in my ability to focus on what I want. If I have a goal, no one is going to deter me from what I want to do. I'm going to get up and work out in the morning and do all the necessary things I have to. I am not going to be talked into looking the other way. When I got to the point where I was a senior partner in the Bulls, the guy who had been there the longest, I started to exert my leadership vocally. I guess you could say I became a tyrant or at least that's how some people chose to interpret those actions. That's not how I viewed it. I knew what it took to come from where we were in 1984. I had put it on the line, and I had earned the right to let my teammates know what I expected to them, and it was no more than I expected of myself. I played in front of 8,000 people a night in the beginning. That never determined how hard I played. It's easy when 18,000 people show up to watch you to play and every game is sold out. It's not hard to find your motivation in that environment. I was playing when Chicago Stadium was half empty, and my effort was exactly the same. And a lot of what Jordan has to say, and he says this in interviews, too, I need to start reading some of my notes to you because I'm going to get to like towards the end of the book and not include the notes, which I think are very valuable and just hearing them talk as well, but it's about managing your mind in this mindset. So in addition to practice and just saying, "hey, no one is going to out prepare me, no one's going to practice more than I do in my craft," right? That's another idea that I'm going to take from Jordan. The other idea is -- another main idea that I think at least I definitely struggle with is like I'm constantly like worried about what's going to happen in the future. Like, "hey, I'll be happy, I’ll be satisfied when I get to x." Then you get to x and you like play that game with you. And it's -- one thing I learned about Jordan is just shocking to me is he just lives and thinks about this moment.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He did it when he was playing in the Bulls. He did it when he became an NBA owner. He talks about it when he's building Brand Jordan. He talks about it now as almost a 60-year person. And actually, let me just read this to you now because this is when he's 58. And he says, "I want to go through a day or a week, not worrying about what I have to do on Wednesday or Thursday because I won't then enjoy Monday." It's just this more living in the moment. He has different ways to say that same idea. All is now, all you can focus on is this moment. And the example I used in the last podcast was the fact that he just won his 6 championships, he's playing the piano, doing champagne everywhere, there's smoke and cigars. And the guys like, hey, you got another one in you. He's like, it's the moment man, live in the moment. We're enjoying this now. We worry about that in October. That discipline it takes. And I think it'll be a lot happier. I think that's also why if you have little kids, like you know they're just usually happy and even if they're upset, they get over it fast because it's all for 18 months or like my son is now, it's like everything is just whatever is happening at that moment. And I think everybody, like every human struggle with that, but especially driven, motivated people struggle more. And I think we must learn to live in a moment because if not, you're compromising the present. Like you just said, if I'm worried about what's happening on Wednesday and Thursday, and we say, I can't enjoy a Monday. And I have limited Mondays left. He talks about he might be 54. I said 58. Now coming to mind, I think he said, "I'm 54 -- at this point of the interview is like, I'm 54 years old. I have limited time left. Whatever, he's 54, 58, same difference. But his point is like I have limited Mondays left. I'm not going to ruin them by worrying about something. I'll worry about Wednesday when I get to Wednesday. I'll worry about Thursday when I get to Thursday. Let's go into this page. This is now what you want and don't rely -- don't really pay attention to other people's expectations of you. Another thing I learned from Kobe Bryant, too, because he was given this interview with Ahmad Rashad, and he talked about when you go through struggles, like what about the fans’ expectations of you.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The question Ahmad Rashad is asking Kobe. And I love it because Kobe has like the stinky face. The stinky is like, "Oh, like if you taste it, you smell something really grows, you can just hit them with the stinky face. And he's like -- and he shook his head immediately. And he's like, "their expectations will never be higher than my own." And I think that the idea there is like you've really messed up with people that have -- they're able -- they can put external expectations on you that are higher than your own. Back to this note focus on the present moment. And then it's all you can control -- focus on the present moment is all you can control and then why not me. So, let's see what Jordan's saying here. All I knew was that I never wanted to be average. I just wanted to follow what I felt. My father put a challenge for me in front of me. I knew what he expected. So back to be a mechanic, be whatever. The expectations I have for myself were beyond my father's expectations. My thoughts were way beyond the idea of preparing myself for a job so I could be like the guy down the street. I had dreams. They were my dreams, and I had no fear of them. And this is an important sentence. I knew going against the grain was part of the process. I wasn't limited by someone else's view of how my dream should look or whether they were reasonable or not. So, he talked about like what do you do after you identify the goal, put all the work in and then let the future emerge. That is a lot different than forcing the issue because you're worried about an outcome that hasn't been determined yet. Anything can happen if you're willing to put in the work and remain open to possibilities. Dreams are realized by effort, determination, passion, and staying connected to that sense of who you are. Why me? Why not me? And he's not saying, "Oh, don't worry about the future, whatever will happen will happen." He's saying the point is like if you did everything possible, if you know, you put all the work in possible, then let the results land where they are. That's not the same thing. It's just being, "Oh, whatever maybe, will be." No, it's like I'm going to do my level best. And then if I know I do that, I will be okay with whatever happens.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so let me give you a quote from another interview. "I never feared about my skills because I put in the work. If you put forth the work, then what are you afraid of?" And then this is a line from his Hall of Fame speech, "limits like fears are often just an illusion." So, then another idea that's going to pop up in this spoke repeatedly. It's really an introduction in why he's worthy of study. It's his extreme mindset. This is the extreme mindset of Michael Jordan. So, he says, if you want to win, you must pay the price. It's not complicated. If somebody didn't want to hear that from me, fine, go play somewhere else. Come on, man. You might be sick, but you can still play. I remember when we were playing Detroit and one of our guys was bent over after getting hit. I said, "don't let them see you in pain." You know why? Because they're going to do it again. And that's going to take your mind of what you need to be doing. Show that you can stand up to whatever they have to give. Let them know it's not affecting you and they won't do it again. But every time your whim out, you bitch about it, you cry to the ref. All I'm going to say is shut up and play. You know what they're trying to do, don't let it happen, play right on through that stuff. And so that is one of his main criticisms about the players that came after him. The fact that they don't look at it. They look at like it's almost like -- there's an echo to what we learned from the great advertisers of the past. The fact that a lot of people are saying, "Hey, I made some tires, buy my tires." It's like, no, no, do you think the best ads is service first. Like what can I offer you? But Jordan's point was like they paid money for you to play like you should show up and play, right? And what he's saying right here about, you got to learn how to play through the pain, don't let people see you struggle, whatever the cases. For some reason, when I got to this section, it made me think of a paragraph that takes place in Henry Ford's autobiography, My Life and Work because Henry Ford had the same mentality about service first.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

You're serving your customer first and your feelings and desires come second. And so he's writing these words almost 100 years ago, but it echoes exactly what Jordan's mentality was when he was playing basketball. I pity the poor fellow who is so soft and flabby that he must always have an atmosphere of good feeling around him before he can do his work. There are such men. And in the end, unless they obtain enough mental and moral hardiness to lift them out of their soft reliance on feeling, they are failures. Not only are they business failures, they are character failures also. It is as if their bones never attained a sufficient degree of hardness to enable them to stand on their own feet. There is altogether too much reliance on good feeling in our business organizations. And Michael is not just preaching this. Like he actually lived this. So that's what gives his words. I feel more weight. This is a continuation of this extreme mindset of Michael Jordan. A leader has to be willing to sacrifice to help everyone else get to where they need to go -- where the team needs to go, rather. No one could take days off with the Bulls because I never took a day off. Horace Grant and I had a falling out because he wanted the day off here and there, and I would chastise him for it. That's what leaders do. They set a standard and everyone has to live up to that standard. It is the same in every great organization. You have to rise to our level. We are not going to drop down to yours. I apply that standard to whatever I do. And this is his mom on the same page reflecting on this. Michael earned every bit of this. I tell people, do you know how many icepacks -- do you know about the icepack on his knees, how he hobbled out of Chicago Stadium some nights, barely able to make it home. I remember that day in Utah, when they call it the flu game, which we learned is the food poisoning game. I'll never forget the day, I told him, "don't play tonight. You are too sick." And what did he do? The best came out because you find a little bit of strength where you keep going -- when you keep going.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

That's determination and focus. The idea that he wasn't going to give up until he had given his last, that is life. Give it your best and all other good things will come to you. Then a few pages later, there's just 2 sentences -- 2 ideas that are conveyed in 2 sentences that I want to bring to your attention, and this is Tinker Hatfield describing what it's like to work with Jordan. "He's just deadly, coolly efficient." And then Jordan talking about how he approaches everything which I love. "I focus on the little things, little things add up to big things." And for some reason, what I was reading this page in the book, it made me think of -- I did this two-part, it's like one of the longest episodes of Founders. It's the Peter Thiel episode. I think it's back in the 30s or something like that. I read Ryan Holiday's book Conspiracy, which I thought the storytelling that book was fantastic, and then Peter's book, Zero to One. And there's something I heard Ryan on a podcast one time. He was doing like the book tour, doing these interviews to publicize the release of that book. I think that's probably how I found the book. Anyways, he said something about Peter Thiel's approach to the Conspiracy, to get revenge against somebody that he felt wronged him. And he's describing the whole arc of that book and all the different decisions that had to go into -- from Peter's perspective, the successful outcome. And the sentence was it was ruthless efficiency and hyper competence. That's the same description of Michael Jordan as well. Now remember, the point of studying Michael Jordan and people like him is because it's not like the person walking around the average person has anywhere close to this extreme mindset that Jordan does. This is an example of that. This guy telling a story has been Michael's friend for 25 years. And this is Michael Jordan's you can't ride the fence story. This is crazy. I was really close to Ralph Sampson. Ralph had a big Puma contract.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

When I would go to Boston with Ralph, we'd go to the Puma warehouse. I would do the same thing when I go out to Nike with Michael. They'd say whatever you want, pick it out and we'll ship it to you. I had my closet that separated out, half Puma, half Nike. Michael comes to my apartment. We're getting to ready to go out and he says, "man, it's kind of cold. Can I borrow one of your jackets?" I said, "sure, go in the closet." He went in there and saw everything separated out. He's in there a little longer than necessary, and he comes out of my room. He has taken all of my Puma stuff out, brought it to the living room and laid on the floor. He goes into the kitchen, gets a butcher knife and literally cuts up everything. This was like his second or third year in the league. He literally took a butcher knife to it all. When he's done, he picks up every little scrap and walks it down to the dumpster. He then says, "Hey, dude, call Howard tomorrow and tell them to replace all of this. But don't ever let me see you in anything other than Nike. You can't ride the fence." That's how Michael thinks. Now we're going to fast forward in the timeline. This is Jordan talking about his time on the Dream Team. And so one of the sentences that stuck out from last week's book or a couple -- the book, the last book rather was that Jordan had been surprised to learn how lazy many of his Olympic teammates were about practice. And then he said something or the office said something that just gives me goose bumps, gives me chills. They were deceiving themselves about what the game required. Think about the extreme mindset of Michael Jordan. This is not only like you have multiple levels like it's extremely hard, about 400 players, something like that, 400 people, forgot the exact number, can get to the NBA, then even smaller number gets to be an All-Star, an even smaller number gets to be chosen for the Olympic team. This is who Jordan is talking about. And then he's saying, even when you got to that level, they didn't understand the importance of practice. They were deceiving themselves about what the game required, but they already got to the Olympics. What are you talking about? And I was thinking about at it was like, well, how many of those players, yes, they got to Olympics, they had individual accolades.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

They got deep in the playoffs. None of -- a lot of them -- none of them won 6 championships on that team. And a lot of them never won a single championship. So I think that really ties into like this extreme outlier mindset that Jordan possesses. So I'm just going to read nearly this whole section to you because I thought it was very interesting. He says the 1992, Barcelona Olympics was one of the best times in my life. You're talking about the greatest players in the world. Guys who had every story written about how great they were, all the things they could do and had done on the basketball court. All I thought about was, "I want to see this for myself. I want to see what those -- these guys are all about." That was my motivation going to the Olympic Games in 1992. We were coming off back-to-back titles. I was exhausted, but I had to see these guys for myself. I had played against them, but I wanted to see how they practiced. The best part of the whole thing turned out to be the practices. All we did was a lineup in play. Chuck Daly, the coach of the Olympics. He just say, "come on, guys, let's go hard for an hour or 2. Let's get loose." That's all he did. He didn't coach -- he didn't call fouls. He just threw the ball out there. The games were competitive as hell, it was up and down the court. We had 12 players, but John Stockton had broken his leg, and Christian Laettner was on the team, but he was still in college, and no one would let him in the games. We played 5 on 5. If Magic got off to a good start or anyone else, the talking would start. These are the teams, Me and Scottie, Chris Mullin, Larry Bird and Patrick Ewing. That was our 5. They had Magic, Drexler, Malone, Charles Barkley and Robinson. Think about this, he beat Magic in the finals, beat Drexler in the finals, beat Malone in the finals and beat Charles Barkley in the finals. That is crazy, I didn't realize that's how I read the sentence. We whip their a** every day. In Monte Carlo, we got into the most heated match of all time. Magic was telling us how great the Lakers were and how Showtime was the best basketball. Me and Pippen are listening to this on the way of practice, and we say, "okay, we're going to show you what the new kids are all about."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Me and Magic talk trash back and forth all day. I was guarding him, and I'm saying, you don't have Kareem now. You got to do it all yourself. At the other end, he was guarding me, and I blew right by him, I'd be trash-talking. This isn't your old team. We beat them so bad. Then when the game was over, Magic said, "we ain't leaving. We got to keep playing." Scottie and I looked at Bird and we said, "we're ready to go." Magic said, "why are you ready to go?" And we said, "because there isn't any competition here." Magic didn't speak to us for 2 days. So another thing that Jordan says in this book, I've also heard him in the interview multiple times that's important. Like if you were being authentic to yourself, if you're making decisions from your instinct, that's the only way you're going to have long-term success because you can't -- if you're just following fad, you're trying to fake something like you can only do that for a short amount of time. And then he combines us with the ideas like skip the shortcut, like it's supposed to be hard. It's hard, but it's fair. Remember his motto. It's going to remind me of there's a quote in that book, the Hour of Fate, I forgot which Founders episode it is, but you'll see it in the archive if you're interested because it's about the partnership like the -- I guess the feud and then the unlikely partnership between Theodore Roosevelt and J. P. Morgan, but Theodore Roosevelt is somebody I'm going to read multiple books on the future. I've already done, I think, what, 2 or 3 podcasts on him at least because he's just a very fascinating individual, and he lived, I feel, multiple lifetimes because he dies relatively early when he's 60. The River of Doubt is a great book about like towards the end of his life and just the crazy things that he would do. And that's also in the archive. But in the Hour of Fate, it said Roosevelt was forever at it. He was a curiosity, always pushing and straining and admonishing friends around him to do the same. Theodore love to row in the hottest sun over the roughest water in the smallest boat. He is not one for shortcuts. Jordan isn't either. So he says, "We have become a shortcut culture. To a certain degree, we define success on the basis of fictional attributes. If a guy has commercials, a lot of money, the girls, the car, then he's considered successful, whether his performance matches all those things or not. “

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“Success to me has nothing to do with how much money you have or what kind of car you drive. I always wanted to know where I fit in with the best. Authenticity is about being true to who you are even when everyone else wants you to be someone else. It is a lot harder to become the best you can be when you're focused on trying to be the best version of someone else. There's nothing authentic in that. And if it's not authentic, then it's not going to last." And so that reminds me of something he said in this interview, the Cigar Aficionado interview because it's like you own an NBA team, you've got businesses going everywhere. Like what is most important to you? And so Jordan says, of all the things I've involved in, my strongest passion is the Jordan Brand because I can impact that in a much greater sense than owning an NBA team. To be able to continually talk to that consumer, to interact with that consumer, it's not dependent on how the season ends. This is the most important part. If I had to pick of all the things I'm involved in, the most important is the Jordan Brand because it's my DNA. It's in my DNA. It is who I am. This is a story coming from the preparation and his work ethic that he was previously applying to basketball and now he is applying it when he's in the minor leagues trying to be a baseball player. And really, this is the Jordan doesn't have an off-button story. What Michael did to get himself ready to play baseball was grueling. He would get up every morning and go to the complex before -- way ahead of the other players. He'd get into the batting cage, swing the bat and knock around the ball. He would do this for an hour to 90 minutes. Then the team would show up and Michael would go through the regular practice, which ran about 3 hours. Then he would go back out for another hour. His hands were so raw that the calluses would rip open every day. The trainers would wrap his hands in gauze and tape. He looked like a prizefighter. The next morning, Michael was back in the cage, swinging a baseball bat for hours. He never missed a day. Not only did he not miss a day, he never said a word about his hands. That's how you get ready. Once the on button is pushed, there isn't an off button.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So another idea I love the fact that Michael was always talking about something he learned from his parents, something he applied for the rest of his life is that you got to take negatives and turn them into positives. So he's got this really famous commercial, Nike commercial. It's the Nike commercial about failure. And I'm just going to read to you real quick because I pulled the transcript. "I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life, and that is why I succeed." So he's asked, I'm going to combine this with something else I heard him talking in this interview is like, what's your biggest regret? "I don't have regrets. To win, you have to lose. To be successful, you have to have something that wasn't successful. To be happy, you have to have disappointment." And to me, that's the idea he's expressing. I just have one sentence for you here. He's talking about the commercial that I just read to you. The idea of not being afraid to make mistakes or using negative outcomes to create positive ones was great. And so let's go back to this mindset. The reason I'm talking about, hey, like you get close to Jordan, you hear his words, you read books about him, you watch his interviews, you're really downloading his operating system and the mindset that he approached his craft, and he talks about the mind over and over again. And he says, the mind will play tricks on you. The mind was telling you that you couldn't go any further. The mind was telling you how much it hurt. The mind was telling you these things to keep you from reaching your goal. How weird and twisted, right, and crazy this is, right? You have a goal, your own mind is trying to play tricks so you don't accomplish that goal. The mind was telling you these things to keep you from reaching your goal, but you have to see past that. Turn it all off if you're going to get where you want to be.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I'm going to read this again. The mind will play tricks on you. The mind was telling you that you couldn't go any further. The mind was telling you how much it hurt. This is Michael Jordan. This is not a soft, weak person, and he's telling you my mind tried to do the same thing to me, right? This is extremely important. The mind was telling you how much it hurt. The mind was telling you these things to keep you from reaching your goal. But you have to see past that, turn it all off if you're going to get where you want to be. So there's a couple of quotes I'm going -- before I go to the next page from my notes on all these talks I’ve been watching. So one of this, I think that will help, and Michael says, "Work ethic eliminates fear." And actually, you know what, before I go back to my notes, what he's talking about the mind playing tricks on you that you're going to be here for work ethic eliminates that. Jeff Bezos -- in the next page, Jeff Bezos, what Michael is about to tell us, remind me of what Jeff Bezos said. He says -- Jeff says, "Stress primarily comes from not taking action over something that you can have some control over." So Michael is saying, "I was as prepared as I could possibly have been for that moment. I couldn't go back and practice a little harder. I knew I had done the right things to prepare myself for that situation. One way or another, I knew I was prepared to be successful." Now if you know you haven't prepared correctly, which is what Jeff is just saying, whereas the root cause of stress or you haven't worked that and then you haven't worked hard enough, that's when other thoughts and emotions creep into your mind. That is stress, that is fear. Pause here, go back to this. Work ethic eliminates fear, right? Back to Jordan's paragraph. it is the same process for doing anything anywhere in life, no matter how big or small whether that's running a corporation, taking a test in the second grade, or taking a shot to win the game. At that moment, and I double underline this sentence, this is fantastic. At that moment, you were the sum total of all the work you have put in, nothing more and nothing less. If you are confident that you have done everything possible to prepare yourself, then there is nothing to fear.

Back to my notes on the talks. I have total confidence in my skill, so I am not afraid. It's the same idea he's expressing, I think, like 15-year gap which in those 2 ideas. So it's obviously very fundamental if he's still talking about it. More notes. "I know I can play this game, and I know I can play at the highest level. You've got a lot of guys with the ability, but they don't have control of their mind." I'm not making this up. How many times is Jordan saying the same idea over again, the importance of having control over your mind. A lot of people can run and jump and shoot, but they don't have the killer instinct and the confidence in themselves to perform those skills. Let's go back to the Zen, his heavy influence from what he learned from Phil Jackson, from the psychologist, a medication, living in a moment like the Zen Buddhism idea. I want to allow whatever is going to happen to happen at its own rhythm. That is just -- there's a single quote on an entire page. I want to allow whatever is going to happen to happen in its own rhythm. Something he told Oprah that's kind of similar to that thought. If you chase something, you might not get it. If you put forth the work, the next thing you know, it's bestowed upon you. Okay. So now he's got a bunch of ideas on this page. So my note is my driving force was to show people what I could do. Wake up and go on the attack. We are on the offense all the time. So there's a -- you can find these principles of Nike in the early days. I think their first marketing manager is one that wrote it out, but they said that we're on the offense all the time. Jordan is the same thing. And then find ways to trick yourself. So let's see what this is about. My driving force, my passion was to impress people with what I could do. It was the idea somebody might be sitting in the stands who had never seen Michael Jordan play before. I thought about that person who had never experienced the excitement or the entertainment I could provide. I would wake up in the morning thinking, how am I going to attack today? And then the idea of even how do you have that motivation every day, even after you -- now he's got the accolades. He's All-Star, gold medals, MVPs, championships.

You've got to trick your mind. You got to play games with yourself. I never knew when my motivation would be until something during that day. It wasn't easy as I went along because I had accomplished so much. I had to trick myself. I had to find a test within the test. I look at these kids today, and they don't know how to trick themselves. They don't even understand the need to find a way to get yourself ready to play at that high level every night. And now we're going to see that. Again, he's holding everybody else to a high standard, but not a higher standard than he held himself. And so this section reminding me of that quote I say to you all the time because I think it's extremely important to know comes from Founder Four Seasons, Issy Sharp, excellence is the capacity to take pains before I read this section to you. Let me read some more quotes from these interviews that I think are echoing what I'm about to read to you. Remember earlier, he's saying, I'm not going to fall down to your level, right? My competitive drive is far greater than anyone else I've ever met. We have a goal of vision to obtain. Sometimes you have to do it when you're tired. It's a test of your will to succeed. So how does this relate to what's happening. He's talking about when he's playing on the Wizards, goes from being GM to going down and trying to get to know the players. At Washington, Kwame Brown said I was hard on him, and I was because I never believed he had ever tried to push himself. He had developed bad habits and I don't believe in bad habits. Tomorrow's kids are going to have to see someone playing hurt, see someone practicing the day after winning a championship. We have to provide examples so they can relate to that ideal. Otherwise, we'll lose the gap that it starts to fade away. And 20 years from now, you'll never see someone play sick or get out on the floor with a sore ankle. So on the same section, we have a friend of his like add to what Michael is saying here. I saw a guy sitting on the training table for 2 weeks with a sprained ankle. Michael had a back spasm one day, and we literally had to carry him off the floor and drive him home in the bed of a truck because he couldn't move. They gave him treatments and -- they gave him heat treatments and cold treatments all night long, and he played the next night. He had fluid drained off his knee. I don't know how many times.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

One night, he had 22 cc's of fluid drained. Do you know how much that is, and that was before the game. So again, I think Michael's words resonate because they're not just words. He's not telling you, "Hey, Scottie, you have a migraine, get in here. Hey, you're back is hurting because in the Last Dance, Michael encouraged him to play, like he said, just go out there to be a decoy. He -- that wouldn't work if he didn't do it himself. And so what did he say? You have a goal, don't you? You have a vision to obtain? Well, sometimes you're going to have to do it when you're tired and sometimes you're not going to feel well. You have to do it anyways. It's a test of your will to succeed. Let me go back to my notes. There's another thing he says in his other interview. If you love something and your goal is to be successful, there's a certain price you have to pay. There's a certain accountability you have to hold. Later in the same interview he says, everything comes with a price. And I'm going to read the last note I have on this and then I'll just finish with the book. Because really, this is something he said about his dad. And he's saying it 25 years after his dad was murdered, right? And part -- like part of the reason Founders exist is, of course, like we want to learn like how they thought about work, the ideas they had. They spent 40, 50 years over their career. They've obviously picked up useful information that is useful for future generations. But work is just a -- like a smaller part of life. It's really like how -- to learn how you have a great life. And so outside of the work relationships, I think about the personal relationships a lot because these are life stories. They're not just work stories, right? And really something that has -- I feel like I've benefited greatly from reading these books is understanding the profound impact that the relationships -- how your relationships with other people affect their journey in life.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It could be your close friends. Obviously, your kids, your life partners, your spouses, whatever it is. But there's 2 -- he just has a few sentences here. There's just 2 ideas that jumped out of me is the fact that he's having this discussion 25 years after his dad died. So the impact that you're going to have if you have kids now or maybe you have kids in the future, like how important that relationship is to your kid and know that's going to affect what you do with them. Your actions are going to affect their lives long after you don't exist anymore. And then Jordan's ability to process and to get control of his mind to take one of the most negative things that could ever happen to a person and say, "hey, I'm going to -- I didn't have control over it. I didn't want it to happen. But moving forward, it's going to have a positive impact on my life," he says. So this is when he asked about his father 25 years after he died. I had him for 32 years. I never look at it from a negative sense. We're talking about I'm not -- yes, I wish he was still here, but I had him for 32 years, right? Obviously, he was murdered. I think about him practically every day. So those 2 ideas, like, yes, I didn't want it to happen, but I had them for 32 years. I got to relish in the fact that I did have him for that long -- for that period of time. I wanted more, but I didn't -- I don't get to control that. I had for 32 years and even almost 3 decades after. He's no longer with me. I'm still thinking about him every day. So let's go back to the book. This -- I almost ended on this because I thought it was so such a great thought. Like it doesn't have to be someone else. It could be you. And so he says, for the 20th-anniversary shoe, we asked, "who's going to be next? Who's going to come along and take Michael Jordan's spot?" In one way or another, just about everyone is going to go through that kind of search. The idea that it could be you is something all of us can relate to when we think about our goals. It doesn't have to be someone else getting all the accolades. It could be you.

And then we have Michael explicitly talking about the fact that building a team on a business is extremely similar to building a team in a sport. Differences, 1 is negative sum and 1 is positive sum. There's only 1 NBA champion. There could be many, many successful businesses. And really, he's going to touch on when it was another main idea, the ones that at least I'm going to take away this idea, okay, practice, right, the important practice, believe in practice is the way I would distill that idea down to its essence, believe in practice. Live in the moment and then the importance that listening is a superpower. How shocked were you when you -- if you listen to the podcast, like the fact that everybody around and talked about Michael is one of the greatest listeners. That is not -- from the outside, does not look that way, right? Just go to what he says here. We bring our personalities, our visions, and our creativity to discussions. He's talking about the team at Jordan Brand. And we don't give a damn about getting credit. We are there to create something beautiful, something representative of what the brand is all about. What I think they like about me is I could admit when I'm wrong, and I can accept criticism, and I can accept creative insight coming from someone other than myself. There are a lot of people who can't do that or won't allow us to us to do that. They all feel like it is an attack on their intelligence or a negative comment on their ideas. They want so much credit that they can't share the credit, but that dynamic is just a destructive inside of creative team or a corporate setting as it is on the basketball court. In its highest form, business is a team game. The team can accept that philosophy. The teams that can accept that philosophy are the teams that get the best chance long term to be successful. Team sports are no different. Give me 5 guys who want to work hard and play together, and I'll take those guys every time over more talented players who can't come together for the good of the group. For years, people have viewed me as an individual and not a team player because I scored so much. But I was a team player. I was just filling my role at that time. Brand Jordan is no different. Even though my name is on the product, it's a collaborative effort. I have the same kind of commitment to the brand that I had to basketball.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I have an intense focus and desire to make the brand successful. But I'm not so dominant that I can't listen to the creative ideas coming -- remember, listen, he said that word, but I'm not so dominant that I can't listen to creative ideas coming from other people. Successful people listen. Those who don't listen, don't survive. And then Jordan closes just a reminder that you just have to focus on the moment, all is now. In all honesty, I don't know what's ahead. If you ask me what I'm going to do for 5 years, I can't tell you. This moment, now that's a different story. I know what I'm doing moment to moment, but I have no idea what's ahead. I'm so connected to this moment that I don't make assumptions about what might come next because I don't want to lose touch with the present. Once you make assumptions about something that might happen or might not happen then you open up the possibility of making mistakes. You start limiting the potential outcomes. I don't make assumptions. I know what I know, and I deal with my life based on what's happening right now. And that is where I'll leave it. To get the full story, buy the book.

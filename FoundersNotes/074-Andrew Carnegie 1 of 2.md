And he says, A sunny disposition is worth more than a fortune. Young people should know that it can be cultivated; that the mind like the body can be moved from the shade into sunshine. Let us move it then. Laugh away trouble if possible. So I think this is important because you might have experienced this before where you might have a problem. Well, let me think back to the podcast we did on Henry Kaiser where I think it was him that said that ''Problems are just opportunities in work clothes.'' So I'm sure you've interacted with people that are more pessimistic and cynical and there's a problem in front of them, and they just think it's the biggest thing in the world. There's nothing I could do, my life is over, oh, well, it was me kind of thing. And then the other side of the spectrum, you have people like Henry Kaiser, he is just like, okay, this is a problem. Well, that's just an opportunity to dress up in work clothes. So let me look -- let me approach it that way. I think as I get older, I realize that there's very few things that are actually like black and white in life, and the perspective in which you approach things influences like your enjoyment of life heavily. And I think that's what Andrew is telling us here, he's like, listen "A sunny disposition is worth more than a fortune." And you should know that it can be cultivating, meaning this is a skill. It's a life skill that you develop through -- with over time and with experience. And at the mind, just like the body can be moved into the shade, from the shade into the sunshine. I think it's extremely important. And he goes right after he gives that great quote. He talks about this grand rule for life, which I think, again, is related to his choice to choose optimism in most things in life as opposed to pessimism. And he's going to hit on that several times throughout the autobiography. And so now he gets into something that's very, very interesting. It's so much that he calls it his grand rule of life, and he says, "So it says, "Let's move it then. "Let's laugh trouble away, if possible."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And one usually can provided that self-approach comes not from his own wrongdoing. That always remains. So what he's talking about is, well, let me read the next sentence and I'll get into it. He says the judge within sits in the supreme court and can never be cheated. Hence the grand rule of life and this is his grand rule of life. ''Thine own reproach alone do fear.'' This motto adopted early in life has been more to me than all the sermons I ever heard. So when I read that, I was really trying to think is like, what is he trying to tell us here? And he's like, listen, you can laugh your trouble away. You can understand that you could take like a more optimistic approach of life, but only if you're not -- if you generally have not done something wrong. So that's what he means when he says the judge within sits in the supreme court and can never be cheated. You know what -- how you feel about yourself. You know if you're putting forward your best effort. You know if you're being a good person. You know if you're making a mistake and carrying on, no matter what. And I think that's extremely important that you cannot control the opinions of other people. There's no human that's ever existed that's been either universally loved or universally hated. That just doesn't exist. And therefore, like if you're exposing yourself like, oh my god, what's this person going to think like that really it comes to superpower. That really doesn't matter. As long as you are comfortable, the judge within sitting inside of yourself, that's analyzing it, analyzing you, analyzing yourself rather. As long as that person is happy, then I think there's no reason that you can't -- it ties into like what he was saying, like you can move your mental state like I just jokingly said, I'm going to adopt a positive mental attitude. I say that like ad nauseam to my friends. It's like a David-ism because I do think like it's extremely important in everything you're doing, especially something is hard. Now on the flip side of that, though, you're not -- you cannot run away from that inner monologue, like if something is eating at you.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

If you know you're doing something that you shouldn't be doing or if you're -- it's very important, like I -- just experiences like right before I go to bed, like your mind just wanders, you sort of replay actions or things you said. And there's -- everybody is going to have regrets in life. I have tons of them. And I feel like the times I have been most unhappy with myself is when I know I'm not putting forth my best effort, or when I know I'm taking a shortcut, or I know, I'm not doing what I should do. And I don't think you can escape that. And that was just -- he's writing these words, let's say in the early 1900s, we're 150, 120 years later, and I think it's still true. The judge within sits in the supreme court and can never be cheated. Like that's just a really interesting way to describe that phenomenon. Okay. So I talked a little bit about this last week. I just think it's really interesting. Looks like a really interesting dichotomy because he talks about his dad was displaced by new technology. And as a result of the displacement of new technology, Andrew experiences some life circumstances that actually motivated him to build wealth. So that -- we've seen multiple times, right? A lot of people that have hard upbringings, they use that as fueled motivation to write the wrongs they felt they experienced early on. But what I also found fascinating is that Andrew experienced several issues with his own workers when they were fearful that they were being displaced by new technology. So this is something that we just have to acknowledge that has happened throughout history. And I would argue it's probably being accelerated more so in the times that we're living in. So he says the change from handloom to steam-loom weaving, his dad was a weaver, was disastrous to our family. My father did not recognize the impending revolution and was struggling under the old system. Let me just pause there before I continue. What's fascinating about that is I don't -- it's impossible to know because he never drew the conclusion explicitly in the book.

Nothing stranger ever came out of the story of this poor Scotch boy who came to America and step by step, through many trials and triumphs, became the great steel-master, built up a colossal industry, amassed an enormous fortune, and then deliberately and systematically gave away the whole of it for the enlightenment and betterment of mankind. Not only that. He established a gospel of wealth that can be neither ignored nor forgotten and set a pace in distribution that succeeding millionaires have followed as a precedent.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. So that's from the introduction of the book that I'm going to talk to you about today, which is the autobiography of Andrew Carnegie. And for today, I'm going to try not to duplicate and cover things I covered in last weekâ€™s podcast because last week, we got an introduction to both Andrew Carnegie and Henry Frick. So the focus of today is going to be things that are actually unique to this book. I'm just going to jump right into his early childhood, oh, by the way, if I sound a little funny, I'm a little under the weather. But as with all things in life, I'm going to adopt a positive mental attitude and persevere and make sure I don't miss any week. So apologies if you find my voice distracting. Hopefully, that's not the case. Okay. So I want to start with one of the traits that I definitely learned from Andrew Carnegie and other founders that we've put on the podcast before is this default level of optimism, that's basically like your default way of approaching life. So we're going to get into that. And then he also is reflecting on what he feels. This is a grand rule of life, and I think this idea is fantastic. And to that end, Andrew is writing. He says, I think my optimistic nature, and my ability to shed trouble and to laugh through life, making ''all my ducks swans,'' as friends say I do, must have been inherited from my grandfather. And then he goes on the next paragraph where this, if you look up like famous quotes from Andrew Carnegie, this is one of the most famous quotes that's attributed to him. And I think probably the most important quote in the book.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Whether he remembered like if this experience influenced something that happened to Andrew later on because if you remember, he first started out trying to manufacture iron because at the time, most railroads, most of the materials needed for like the expansion of the United States. They were doing -- the bridges included. They were all iron-based and Andrew picked up really fast that there's a new material. There's a new technology is one way to think about it. And that technology is steel. And steel has all these other advantages that iron does not. And so if one can find a way to produce -- to find an economic way to produce steel, it is inevitable that steel is going to displace iron. So he just happened to be at the right time and the right place to make this observation. So he, in some sense, righted the wrong that his father always failed to do. So now Andrew is going to reference, I think after his dad loses his job, they obviously have to flee, they come over to America. And his takeaway in one sentence is a good summary, he says, I remember that shortly after this, ''I began to learn what poverty meant.'' That's a hell of a sentence. And then the next one is what he's going to do about it? And he says, and then and there came to resolve that I would cure that when I got to be a man. I left out the word that. He says, then and there came to resolve that I would cure that when I got to be a man. So he had to go through these uncomfortable situations and realize, hey, you know what, I don't want to find myself in the situation, so I'm going to damn sure do everything I can in my power to avoid the same fate that my father and then downstream the family is experiencing. So now he's in America -- this is about his school and his work from an early age. And then another trait that I find common in a lot of these biographies is just a high level of disagreeableness, wanting to bend others to your -- the way you view the world and what you think is actually possible. And so I say school is a perfect delight to me. And if anything occurred, which prevented my attendance, I was unhappy. This happened every now and then because my morning duty was to bring water from the well.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I may have misspoke earlier, this is actually -- this is before he moves to America. He's 10 years old at the time, still living in Scotland. So he says -- so he has to work in the morning to bring the water from the well before he's allowed to go to school and he goes school at day and then he has to work at night. So he says, I had often the shop errands to run after school. So that looking back upon my life, I had the satisfaction of feeling that he become useful to my parents even at the early age of 10. And I think that's a fundamental trait for humans. I think we all want to feel it useful. Whether we're 10 years old or fully formed adults. I became acquainted in a small way with business affairs even in childhood, and I'll talk about more of that in a minute. And then this is the high-level disagreeableness though. He says, I earned the reputation of being ''an awful laddie.'' In this way, I probably developed the strain of argumentativeness or perhaps combativeness, which has always remained with me. In the performance of these duties, I was often late for school. And I didn't take this like high-level disagreeableness, it doesn't mean that you have to be a jerk. I just think it means like you have a certain view on what you think you're capable of and most of what you're experiencing in outside world tells you otherwise, and that doesn't matter to you? Because I mean, why else would you search a company. I've talked about this all the time. One of the things like I think we're seeing going on right now in the United States with the lowest rates of new company creation like 40 years or something like that. And so it's standard. It's expected of you, get good grades, go to school and get a good job. And so anybody who deviates from that, you're inevitably going to -- except you don't come from like a family or an environment of entrepreneurship, like you're going to get pushback. And you see that all the time like, "Oh, you can't do that. You can't do this. That's impossible. And so people that don't have that high-level disagreeableness might actually let other people persuade, persuade them into actually believing them.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I do think it's -- and maybe this is just like me justifying how I am. But I do think it's a good trade to have. Okay. I'm going to read this next section to you. And then I'm going to relate it to how it makes me think of this quote I love by Jeff Bezos. Just it says I cannot name a more important means of benefiting young people than encouraging them to commit favorite pieces to memory and recite them often. And he makes a huge, really important point here. Anything which pleased me I could learn with a rapidity that surprised friends. I could memorize anything whether please me or not, but if it did not impress me strongly, it passed away in a few hours. So -- okay, so let me see if I can explain like this -- these disparate thoughts I'm having. Okay. So I think this gives you a math -- if you love what you're doing, like there's this whole debate about whether like you should follow your passion or if that's actually a good advice or if it's bad advice. And I fall in the sense of, listen, I have one life, I have no idea what happens to me after I die. Let's assume this is the only chance I get to exist. Like I don't -- work is going to be a huge part of your life. It's going to take up 50% of the time you're actually conscious and awake. The idea of just struggling through something that you absolutely hate seems to me like a waste of life, right? And unfortunately, I feel that's like the default setting for most of humanity, whether you're talking about like 115 billion, 120 billion people that have ever lived is definitely the case for them. And I would say most of the people love today. But he made this good point. So Jeff Bezos says this great quote. He's like, listen, you don't choose your passions, they choose you. And he's talking about, listen, I was 5 years old when I started love of rockets. He's like, I hit this lottery winning called Amazon. And the reason I liquidate $1 billion a year in Amazon stock to fund my rocket company, Blue Origin is because I've been obsessed with space and rockets since I was 5. I didn't choose that passion. It chose me. And Jeff's advice to us is listen to it. You know what you're interested in, and you got to kind of follow that path.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And Andrew is hitting on this too because he's like listen, I'll memorize anything. But if I don't actually care about it, it's not going to stick. So if you're giving advice to people don't follow passion, it's a bad idea, it's a mistake, et cetera, et cetera. Like I just feel the people that love what they do, even if it's hard, or have such a huge advantage over people that don't. And I've told you many times I keep all these quotes and clips and videos on my phone, just so like I referenced constantly over and over again because I like to expose myself to ideas. Once I find an idea is powerful, I think like, oh, don't just read it once, watch it once like do it over and over again. Because as you change throughout time, the meaning of that changes as well. For example of this, I bought Andrew Carnegie's -- and read Andrew Carnegieâ€™s biography the first time like years ago. And what I noticed was almost every single highlight I made the first time I read it was very different from the ones that I made this time and the ones I'm actually sharing with you because I'm a different person I was a few years ago. So anyways, I have a video that talks about this, and it's in line with what Andrew is telling us and what Jeff is telling us, and it's Steve Jobs talking about his advice about why you should follow your passions like that is the actual right path forward. So I apologize in advance for the audio quality. I'm playing it on my phone into the microphones. Hopefully, this sounds good, but it's going to -- it's 50 seconds of Steve Jobs talking to us. People say you have to have a lot of passion for what you're doing and it's totally true. And the reason is because it's so hard that if you don't, any rational person would give up. It's really hard. And you have to do it over a sustained period of time. So if you donâ€™t love it, if youâ€™re not having fun doing it, you don't really love it, you're going to give up. And that's what happens to most people, actually. If you really look at the ones that ended up being ''successful'' in the eyes of society and the ones that didn't, oftentimes, it's the ones who were successful loved what they did so they could persevere, you know, when it got really tough. And the ones that didn't love it quit because they're sane, right? Who would want to put up with this stuff if you don't love it? So it's a lot of hard work and it's a lot of worrying constantly and if you don't love it, you're going to fail. So you've got to love it and you've got to have passion."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He says, most businessmen whom I've known, invest in bank shares and far away enterprises, while the true gold lies right in their own factories. I have always tried to hold fast to this important fact. It has been with me a cardinal doctrine that I can manage my own capital better than any other person, much better than any Board of Directors. My advice to young men would be not only to concentrate the whole time and attention on the one business in life in which they engage but to put every dollar of their capital into it. As for myself, my decision was taken early. I would concentrate upon the manufacturer of iron and steel and be the master of that. So as you probably know, I take a lot of notes on podcasts and talks and all this other stuff. It's actually, if you go to davidcenter.com, you can see all my notes there. I'm slowly -- I have like 5,000-plus individual notes that Iâ€™m slowly starting to add to the website. So davidcenter.com, you can see it free. And I just -- it's funny when I was reading this, I was also listening to this talk given many years ago by -- it's a quick little video. Itâ€™s on my website about Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett on diversification. They're echoing exactly what Andrew Carnegie said 100 years earlier. And the quote is, this is from Warren Buffett. Diversification is for people who don't know what they're doing. Look at how all the great fortunes were built. So he talks about he's like, it's madness to him and Charlie Munger that modern finance classes tell you diversify, diversify, diversify. And he's like, listen, if you have -- if you can invest in 3 great businesses in your lifetime, you'll become very rich. The idea that you have a list of -- you're supposed to invest in 40 or 50 businesses, and you think you can understand them intimately. And he's like, why, if you know what you're doing, diversification is basically for people who don't know what they're doing, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. So that's just my own personal opinion is more in line with like the Jeff Bezos to Steve Jobs to Andrew Carnegie, I think -- and I've worked on so many things when it was just for money for years. And you can make a ton of money. And it sounds clichÃ©, people like, oh, it's not going to make you happy, it doesn't unless you're -- I think -- I mean think about what Steve Jobs was doing. Like he was worth $100 million at 22 years old, 24 years old something like that. Like he made more money before he is 25 and he was set for life. He came back to Apple, took no compensation in '97. Like why would somebody do that? Like they clearly love what they're doing. Even if it's really hard because he even talked about like the struggles he was going through during that time period, he thought led to -- all the stress led to the growth of cancer ultimately took his life. But I just think it's better to have a short life well-lived than a long one full of misery. That sounds really smart, but that's an Alan Watts quote. I can't take credit for that. All right. Let me skip ahead. Also, he's still talking about -- Andrew is talking about -- I love this anecdote that he talked about from his early childhood that he applied now looking back on his life to the reason for his success. And he says, hire people that know more than you and then study human nature. He says my first business venture was securing my companions' services. So think of friends. He's a funny way of talking, for a season as an employer, remember, he is a little kid, the compensation being that the young rabbits, when such came, should be named after them.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So they're trying to collect young rabbits. I don't know if they're going to sell the rabbits. I assume they're doing this for food. I'm not entirely sure. And so to attract rabbits, you need food, right? So you need help. Andrew is getting all his little friends here to gather up a bunch of foods and flowers and stuff that rabbits eat and attract them. And he's saying, I have nothing to pay you, but I'll name the rabbit after you. And he says, remembered the little kids. So he says the Saturday holiday was generally spent by my flock, meaning my friends, in gathering food for the rabbits. My conscience reproves me today looking back when I think of the hard bargain I drove with my young playmates, many of whom were content to gather dandelions and clover for a whole season with me, conditioned upon this unique reward, the poorest return ever made to labor. Alas! what else have I had to offer them! Not a penny. So he is saying, listen, it's really interesting that humans would work, give up their Saturday for an entire season and do all this work for free in the sense there's no like monetary payment, but because you promised them something that they found valuable later on, which is being named after a rabbit, they would do that. And so he says, I treasure the remembrance of this plan as the earliest evidence of organizing power upon the development of which my material success in life has hung. So he's like, listen, the only reason I made all this money. I was able to do things. I was able to do it because I had one skill and the skill was organizing large groups of people to work in cohesion, is that the right word? To work together. So he says, a success not to be attributed to what I have known or done myself, but to the faculty of knowing and choosing others who did know better than myself, he continues, precious knowledge this for any man to possess. I did not understand steam machinery, but I tried to understand that much more complicated piece of mechanism, man, so he's telling you listen, I may not know the intricacies of how my factory works down to every little detail but I do understand humans. And that is a very valuable skill when you need to organize a bunch of them to work towards the same goal. And that is what actually derived my wealth, not the fact that I knew every little bit about like steam machinery, for example. So I just want to hit on this because I think it's really important.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Another thing. He's constantly -- remember, he's writing these words 100-plus years ago. So he's going to say, "Man should do this. Man should do this. Men should do this. It's just the times, it's humans. The idea that he's giving us. They apply to women, they apply to men, it's just humans do this. So I just want to obviously -- I think it's obvious, but I want to point that out. Okay. So again, I'm going to reiterate his desire to work hard, was fueled large in part to avoid property. And something that I feel is like I don't like being dependent on other people. I don't like -- another way I've heard this put, and I echoed the statement is like I don't want to rely on the good graces of other humans as much as I can avoid it. And Andrew is echoing that here. He says the great question now was what could be found for me to do. So at this point, I think he's in America. I just completed my 13th year and I fairly panted to get to work that I might help the family to start in the new land. So they're in America, the prospect of want had become to me, a frightful nightmare, prospective one. It's another way to say probably. My thoughts at this period centered in the determination that we should make and save enough of money to produce $300 a year, $25 monthly, so that's a family goal, which I figured was a sum required to keep us without being dependent upon others. And something I think his parents did that was really smart is they involved Andrew. Andrewâ€™s the oldest child into -- he basically ran the books of the family, even at young age. He knew what everybody is making, we knew what their expenses was, were. And I'll get into more about how like that kind of echoes, how he ran his business later on in life. But his father gets a job in the factory, remember he can't be a weaver anymore, and his father is able to get him hired as well. And so this is his first paying job and then also about the happiness he experienced contributing to his family.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I think that's like the biggest thing that I didn't understand when I was younger. I was much more selfish is like if you can involve yourself like the satisfaction that comes from involving yourself into something that's larger than just your own life. And I'm talking about family in Andrew's case, that's what he's talking about as well. So he says in his factory, he also came from your position as a bobbin boy. And my first work was done there at $1.20 per week. I talked about it last week. It was a hard life. In the winter, father and I had to arise and breakfast in the darkness, reach the factory before it was daylight and with a short interval for lunch, worked till after dark. The hours hung heavily upon me and in the work itself, I took no pleasure, but the cloud had a silver lining as it gave me a feeling that I was doing something for my world, our family. So heâ€™s saying, "Hey, I'm willing to struggle if it's for the greater good. I have made millions since then, but none of those millions gave me such happiness as my first week's earnings. I was now a helper of the family, a breadwinner, and no longer a total charge upon my parents. So ever since I read the book on Charles Goodyear and this term, manic optimism hasn't left me. And I definitely feel Andrew had manic levels of optimism as well. So he's working in a factory. Eventually, he's working down the basement, just all these fumes and gases he has to inhale a day, and it made him sick and it made him vomit. So he says, "If I had to lose breakfast or dinner, I had all the better appetite for supper and the allotted work was done." So think about what's happening here. The smell of oil made him sick and made him vomit, right? So he's saying that's what he means by if I had to lose breakfast or dinner. I think he meant lunch because he has a better appetite for supper. Oh, well, more room in my stomach for dinner. That is manic levels of optimism. And when he talked about it earlier, the quote I read where his friend said that he turns all ducks and the swans. How many people -- most people were like, "Oh, what was me, I mean, granted, I wouldn't -- I don't think kids should be working in that environment or adults for that matter. But he just refused to give into like the cynicism or the pessimism. And he's like, all right well, I just had look, what's the upside?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. I'm throwing up everything I eat, but I will be extra hungry at night and my work is done. Next, he starts to get like promote it really, really rapidly. And he hears about this office job. So he wanted -- he desperately want to get a factory work, going to get to the office. So he goes and takes, he goes and visits Pittsburgh and gets hired. But the moral of the story before I read it to you, is if you want something done, if it's important, don't delay, do it now because you know that we're prone to procrastination and like there's just -- you have the time, you know you need to do it, so do it right now. And it's an example of that. So he says the interview was successful. I took care to explain that he did not know Pittsburgh that perhaps I would not do, maybe I couldn't do the work, and would not be strong enough. But all I wanted was a trial. That's also a good way if you need to get a job, say, "Hey, just test me, give me a contract for 2 weeks or a month. Let me see if I can do it, and that kind of lowers the commitment level. So he says, he asked me how soon I could come and said that I should stay now, if wanted, meaning no, I'll start it right now. And looking back over the circumstance, I think that answer might well be pondered by young men. It is a great mistake not to seize the opportunity. The position was offered to me, something might occur. Some other boy might be sent for. Having got myself in, I propose to stay there if I could. That is really, really smart that he picked up on that at such a young age. So -- okay, this is books as being a vehicle for self-improvement. And a reminder that we all should be kinder, and this is definitely something like I need to work on. Because kind acts, I remember it for a long time. He's a young boy, when he's experiencing the story I'm about to share with you.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And now he's writing about it 60 years later. So he says, talks about how busy he is. He says, This did not leave much time for self-improvement, nor did the wants of the family leave any money to spend on books. So in other words, I'm spending all my day working, all my money is going to my family. Yes, I want to improve. Yes, I know I should be reading, but I just don't have the resources at the moment. He says, there came, however, like a blessing from above, a means by which the treasures of literature were unfolded to me. Colonel James Anderson, I bless his name as I write this, announced that he would open his library of 400 volumes to boys, so that any young man could take out, each Saturday afternoon, a book which could be exchanged for another on the succeeding Saturday. So basically, this guy is saying, "Hey, you can read a book a week for free, just use my library and you can't get another book till you bring the other one back. Andrew also talks about because he founded -- later in his life, Andrew founded, I don't know, like 400 public library, something like some ridiculous number like that. And he talks about the fact that this active kindness from this older gentleman, like it changed his life. And he wanted to try to do the same for people following after him. So this is what I was mentioning earlier, how his family did something really smart by involving him into the family finances. And Andrew ran his business the same way. He would control costs and he would know every expenditure. So he says, every penny that I could save, I knew was needed at home. My parents were wise and nothing was withheld for me. I knew every week, the receipts of each of the 3 who were working -- my father, my mother and myself, I also knew all the expenditures. And so he's -- he had the reputation of just -- I don't care about revenue. I don't care about profit. I want only cost.

He kind of intuited at a very young age, what Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard would say is like you need to avoid the tyranny of compound costs. And so in this case, it's like I know how much we're making, but also now down to the penny what we're spending it on. Again, I think like you can't control the station you are in life currently, but you can control what you're going to do about it and make sure that you're not wasting any opportunity to pick up new skills because you know where those new skills are going to lead you in the future. This is an example of that. Andrew wasted no opportunities to learn new skills. And so now he's in the office, he has to get there early in the morning, and he has to sweep up. But he says having to sweep up the operating-room in the mornings, the boy, this is not a hospital, it's just the name of the office. The boys had an opportunity of practicing upon the telegraph instrument before the operators arrived. This is a new chance. I soon began to play with the key and to talk with the boys who are at the other stations who had like purposes to my own. Whenever one learns to do anything, he has never to wait long for an opportunity of putting his knowledge to use. So the reason I think this is so important because this skill that he's picking up, right? He's not hired. He's not a telegraph operator, but he learns how to do it, he learns Morse code. That skill leads to him to working for this guy named Thomas Scott. Thomas Scott worked for the Pennsylvania railroad, getting introduced to -- if you never learned how to operate telegraph in the spare time, he would have never been introduced to Thomas Scott. If he never was introduced to Thomas Scott, he would have never worked with Pennsylvania railroad. If he never worked with the Pennsylvania railroad, he would have never been introduced to the idea of investing and in manufacturing iron and steel, which a lot of its customers were railroads later in life. So this little one act that he's doing in his spare time just because he doesn't like wasting time winds up opening the doors years later, that lead him to finding his life's work. That's why it's just -- you just don't waste any opportunity to learn something new. Even if you don't know when you're going to apply it yet. He didn't know. No one could predict from the point -- from this point in his life how this is going to wind up. It's just, hey, it's a good rule of living.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Let me just try to learn -- I would say like my fantasy, I'd like to learn things like Neo and The Matrix. Where just like he sits in the chair, you download now, like our Black Belt Jiu-Jitsu or you like you know whatever, calculus or physics or anything. I just -- I would love that access to that technology because I think, again, knowledge just makes us superhuman. Okay. So here's something interesting. So eventually, Thomas Scott recruits him. He's like, listen, we're going to -- the Pennsylvania railroad is eventually going to run their own telegraph lines because our -- the communication is so important to our business, why don't you come over and run this for me, right? And -- what happens is he has some advice for us here. And what's happening at the time is Thomas is late to -- he's working for Thomas for several months, maybe even over a year at this point. Thomas is late to the office one morning, and there's a bunch of catastrophes on the railroad. So at this time, crashes were a lot more frequent than they were now. And this has happened before. And what he realized because Scott gives them the order, right, Thomas Scott gives him the order and then Andrew's job is to relay that information. So he's kind of -- he knows, hey, this situation happened. This is Thomas in the past, he's told me to do and like he kind of know, he sees everything there. So he's in a conundrum. He's like, what do I do here? Like, I know the right thing like what he would want to do if he wasn't here, but I'm not allowed to -- he has to send a communication to everyone on what to do, but he has to forge -- basically say making it seem like it's coming from Thomas Scott as opposed to just Andrew. And so we wind up taking this risk, and then he tells -- he tells when Thomas gets to the office, he tells him what he did. And Thomas didn't say anything. He said, okay, then just didn't say good or bad about it. But he realized through Thomas' actions that it was the right thing to do.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he says, the battle of life is already half won by the young man who has brought personally in contact with high officials, okay? So Thomas is a high executive. This guy at the time, Andrew is just a young guy like assistant basically. And the great aim of every boy should be to do something beyond the sphere of his duties, which is what he did, something which attracts the attention of those over him. And what happens later on? Eventually, Thomas stops giving him orders and just let Andrew answer like the incoming, "Hey, what do you think Thomas, we should do? Andrew starts dictating what they should do. Thomas realized, "Oh, this guy knows what he's doing. I don't need to micromanage you now. And so go ahead and you know what I would do in the situation, go ahead and do that in a situation so that winds up leading to more opportunities because as Thomas keeps getting promoting the railroad, he constantly recommends that Andrew takes a spot to where it was. And that again, then Andrew becomes an executive, meets all these people, learns about investing, and again, opens the doors to run his company later on. So all these things are related. Okay. I'm going to read something a little longer. And at this point, he started that bridge building company, which is called Keystone Bridge Works. And I think this echoes a little bit what we learned about Yvon Chouinard about like quality as a distribution strategy. And he says the lesson he learned from his bridge building business; the surest foundation of a business is the quality of its product. The Keystone Bridge Works have always been a source of satisfaction to me, almost every concern that had undertaken to erect iron bridges in America had failed. Many of the structures themselves had fallen and some of the worst railway disasters in America had been caused in that way. Some of the bridges had given away under wind pressure, but nothing had ever happened to a Keystone Bridge. There has been no luck about it. We only use the best material and enough of it, making our own iron and later our own steel. We were our own severest inspectors and will build a safe structure or none at all.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

When asked to build a bridge, which we knew to be too insufficient strength or of unscientific design, we declined. Any piece of work bearing the stamp of the Keystone Bridge Works, we were prepared to underwrite. We were proud of our bridges. This policy is the true secret of success. Uphill work, it will be for a few years until your work is proven. But after that, it is smooth sailing. Instead of objecting to inspectors, they should be welcomed by all manufacturing establishments. A high standard of excellence is easily maintained, and men are educated in the effort to reach excellence. I have never known a concern to make a decided success that did not do good, honest work. And even in these days of the fiercest competition when everything would seem to be a matter of price, there still lies at the root of great business success, the very much more important factor of quality. So he's saying, something left out there is that sometimes they'd bid against other bridge companies, and they would have a higher price. But because they had -- they had proven how good their product was, they would actually be aware of the contract. The effect of attention to quality upon every man in the service from the President of the concern, down, he uses the word concern, just you could think of business, down to the humble labor cannot be overestimated. And bearing on the same question, clean, fine workshops and tools, well-kept yards, and the surroundings are of much greater importance than is usually supposed. So that's the whole idea of that, how you do one thing is how you do all things. So you can't really build the best product if you're not even taking care of like the environment, which you're doing your work. So clean it up, make sure your tools are well kept. They're well-maintained, and everything is clean. Okay. So now this is an example of how he started to introduce cost accounting to manufacturing. And again, he's just a reminder to watch your cost. And this blew my mind when he describes what the environment was in manufacturing beforehand. And again, that opportunity is still present to this day.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

When you actually go deeper and understand for lack of a better term, how the sausage is made, you're going to find environments and questionable ways of doing things just like Andrew Carnegie did. And therefore, if you can solve that problem, there's an opportunity for you. So let me give an example. As it became acquainted with the manufacture of iron, I was greatly surprised to find that the cost of each of the various processes was unknown. It was a lump business. And until stock was taking and the books balance at the end of the year, the manufacturers were in total ignorance of results. I heard of men who thought their business at the end of the year would show a loss and had found a profit and vice versa. So how crazy is that. They can't even tell you till the end of the year when they do all their accounting. How am I doing? You just never could run a business like that. I felt as if we were moles burrowing in the dark, and to me, this was intolerable. I insisted upon such a system of weighing and accounting being introduced throughout our works as would enable us to know what our cost was for each process and especially what each man was doing, who saved material, who wasted it, and who produced the best results. To arrive at this was a much more difficult task than one would imagine. Every manager in the mills was naturally against the new system. Come on. That's something we've seen over and over again. People don't like change. Even think about that, think of how ridiculous of a sentence that was based on a few paragraphs above that. Every manager in the mills was naturally against the new system. You don't even know what you're doing, and you want me to continue on like this. Like you're ridiculous, that's just silly. All right. Years were required before an accurate system was obtained, but eventually, we began to know not only what every department was doing, but what each one of the many men working at the furnaces was doing, and thus to compare one with another, they couldn't even tell the quality of their staff before this. How ridiculous is that? Think about how large a component of expenses is laborious to most businesses. And you don't even know which one is better than the other.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

One of the chief sources of success in manufacturing is the introduction and strict maintenance of a perfect system of accounting, so the responsibility for money and materials can be brought home to every man. Owners who, in the office, this is such a good point that he makes about like just you take the same situation in a different environment, the same kind of thinking, which would be intolerable in one environment, you accept another. I guess what I mean about that we're rationalizing, and not a rational species. Owners who, in the office would not trust a clerk with $5 without having a check upon him, meaning checking up on what he is doing, we're -- these same people that wouldn't give you $5, right, without oversight. We're supplying tons of material daily to men in the mills without exacting an account of their stewardship by weighing with each return in the finished form. So you're nickel and diming, this guy might -- you're aware this guy might misuse $5 with the resources, meaning your -- meanwhile, your largest other source of costs, raw materials and manufacturing, maybe that might not be larger in labor, but it's up there. And you're not -- you don't even know what's happening. That's silly. And you know what, it's interesting that this is going -- this process was going on, playing out thousands and thousands of time. Other people were running business is manufacturing for 100-plus years before this, maybe 50-plus years before this time period, and it took -- Andrew Carnegie realized, "Hey, this is untenable. You can't do this. And by investing in taking years of doing the hard work, this gives them a massive advantage later on because heâ€™s the one of the few people actually know what the costs are. And once you know something, then you can manage it and then you start whittling it down, et cetera, et cetera. All right. Another reminder is invest in technology because just like young Andrew wanted to avoid compound costs while he wants to embrace the compounding savings that happens with new technology. So he talks about -- he's one of the first people to invest in -- he would keep an eye on the new technology in iron and steel.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then when a better process came along, you'd immediately jump on it and a lot of people criticize them for this. So he says, I well remember the criticisms made by older heads among the Pittsburgh manufacturers about the extravagant expenditures we were making upon the newfangled furnaces. So again, something I would say, human scoring the abstract. What does that mean in the situation before I continue on what I'm going to read? All this sees the price on something that you're paying today is not abstract, right? Oh my God, Andrew Carnegie is paying $1 million for this machine hypothetically. But his abstract is the savings that he's going to reap over the lifetime of that machine. That's harder to calculate for us. We like things that are right in front of our face. So yes, I'm paying $1 million upfront, but I'll recoup that $1 million in the first 3 years, and I'll keep the machine for 10 years, which means I'm actually -- this $1 million is going to benefit me anywhere from $3 million to $5 million, depending on when I have to replace it. But these old heads, as he calls them older heads, are only focused on the non abstract price that he's paying today. So it says but in the heating of great masses of material, almost half the waste could sometimes be saved by using the new furnaces. The expenditure would have been justified, even if it had been doubled, yet it was many years before we were followed in this new departure, meaning many years still other people figure this out. And in some of those years, the marginal profit was so small that most of it was made up from the savings derived from the adoption of the improved furnaces. Our strict system of accounting enabled us to detect a great waste possible in hitting large masses of iron. This is probably -- I keep saying this for everything -- this is a very important idea. Andrew understood how valuable your attention is. So he's going to talk about realizing and keep in mind, he was doing this with checking the newspaper every day. I can imagine what you would think today the age of endless social feeds that never end. So he talks about, he's got to sell all of his -- he's got some investments going on and some of them were publicly traded, and he would -- he found himself like compulsively checking the prices all the time.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he said they included some stocks and securities that were quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. And I found that when I opened my paper in the morning, I was tempted to look first at the quotations of the stock market. As I determined to sell all my interests in every outside concern and concentrate all my attention upon my manufacturing concerns in Pittsburgh, remember, this goes back to what his saying was he said, "Listen, I don't know any people that build great fortunes by having their hands in a bunch of different things. They usually -- if you looked at how great fortunes were made, it's by one person finding a business that they love and being the best in the world of that business. So he's like put all your eggs in one basket and watch that basket, which is kind of funny that like modern finance tries to teach us opposite of that. So he says, as I determined to sell all my interest in every outside concern and concentrate my attention upon my manufacturing concerns in Pittsburgh, I further resolved not even to own any stock that was bought and sold upon any stock exchange. Now why is he doing that? Such a course should commend itself to every man in the manufacturing business and to all professional men, I would say to people everywhere. From the manufacturing man, especially the rule would seem all important, Ready. His mind must be kept calm and free if he is to decide wisely the problems which are continually coming before him. Nothing tells in the long run like good judgment and no sound judgment can remain with the man who's mind is disturbed by the mercurial changes of the Stock Exchange. What he's telling us is like your attention is super valuable. And if you're splitting it on all these other things, I mean your business over time will be less valuable. And he understood his own nature to realize, "Hey, if I own the stocks, I know myself, I'm going to check them every day. So what solution? If I check them every day, that's attention away from my business. So the solution is get rid of the stocks. He says, it places him under an influence akin to intoxication? What is not he sees and what he sees is not, I mean he's confusing himself. His Fooled by Randomness is to quote one of my favorite books. He cannot judge relative values or get the true perspective of things. The molehill seems to him a mountain and the mountain a molehill and it jumps at conclusions which he should arrive at by reason. His mind is upon the stock quotations and not upon the points that require calm thought. Speculation is a parasite feeding upon values and creating none.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So the moral of this section is, listen, your time is very valuable. And one of my favorite quotes about this that, again, in today's day and age, people don't seem to understand. That's nice that social networks don't charge you any money, but it's not free. Your attention has valuable. And if you really thought about it, and most people don't because, again, human scoring the abstract, this is clear because there's only -- money is not finite, you can make more, right? But time is finite. Therefore, the most expensive way to pay for anything is with time, avoid that. Okay. This is the story Andrew never forgot. I'm not going to give you the background, I'm just going to read about 2 paragraphs to you. The takeaway for Andrew was, it's wiser to be optimistic than full of anxiety and worry, so he's this old guy, which says on one occasion, while we were comparing notes, he told me that he always found comfort in the story, an old man having suffered from all the ills that flesh is heir to and a great many more than it usually encounters and being commiserated by his neighbors, I guess, being chastised, replies, yes, my friends, all you say is true. I have had a long, life full of troubles, but there is one curious fact about them, nine-tenths of them never happened, right? So what is he describing? Anxiety? True indeed, most of the troubles of humanity are imaginary and should be laughed out of court. It is folly to cross a bridge until you come to it. What's anxiety? It's about worrying about the uncertainty of the future or to bid the Devil good morning until you meet him. It is perfect folly.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

All is well until the stroke falls and even then, 9 times out of 10, it is not so bad as anticipated. And so Andrew leaves us with a lesson. A wise man is the confirmed optimist. So going back to his idea about -- listen, you need to focus your efforts, do not diversify. Pick your -- if you're not working on your best idea, you're doing it wrong. Work on your best idea and focus on that. Do not be distracted. And he says, I'd become interested in building some railways in the western states, but gradually withdrew from all such enterprises and made up my mind to go entirely contrary to the adage not to put all eggs in one basket. I determined that the proper policy was actually to put all good eggs in one basket and then watch that basket. I believe the true road to preeminent success in any line, let's use any business, is to make yourself master in that line, making yourself master in that business. I have no faith in the policy of scattering one's resources. And in my experience, I rarely have ever met a man who achieved preeminence in moneymaking who was interested in many concerns. The men who have succeeded or men who have chosen one line and stuck to it. It is surprising how few men appreciate the enormous dividends derivable from an investment in their own business. He makes a huge point here about the best return is not investing in other people. It's investing in what you're doing.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So if you just want to not think about it and buy the whole market, that's the whole index fund, revolution that Jack talks about, that Jack talks about. But what Warren is saying there is like, listen, if you've identified 3 great businesses, why would you put money into the 35th great business that you know? Like, no, you put it #3, you put it #1, that's not -- you're not going to get outside success by just trying to replicate the market. And so I think this is extremely important. I would combine it with what he's saying, the examples that the 2 examples, I think, go in hand to hand that listen, your attention is extremely valuable, so guard it; and two, put that attention to what you should be working on. Don't let yourself get distracted. So don't diversify, focus. All right. And so he gets into a little bit about like this whole issue with the labor shortage and then the stuff that happened. Andrew's take is like, listen, if I was in home -- if I was in Pittsburgh, I was in Scotland when this went down, I would have just shut down and waited for the strike to be open, my partner chose a different route, right? And he puts -- he said something, and I don't know if it's true in the sense that like this is -- because I don't know enough about his business. It was a private company like we're not privy to lot of this information, but he says, "I believe that higher wages to men who respect their employers and are happy and contented are a good investment, yielding indeed big dividends. This is the point I was trying to make last week that it was unwise if you look at all costs of a business, these as an example in the book last week, the same -- that all costs are the same, whether vegetables or men, that didn't make sense to me because humans are dynamic and they respond in emotional ways. They're not vegetables. You can't just say, "Oh, all costs are the same.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And not only are not all the costs the same, but there's benefits to not turning over your workforce constantly, right? Benefits in the future that are only realized if those people stick with you. So I was listening to one of the founders of this company called Zapier, nameâ€™s Wade Foster, I think. And he was talking about our podcast. He's like, listen, we're a remote-only company. So he's like I feel that being a remote-only company helps our retention. Why would he bring that up? Why is that important? He said, listen, our retention rate last year was 94%. They have 94% of all their employees that started the year, finished the year with them. And his point he makes here is really important, in my opinion. He says, when people stay longer, you have more continuity. You get efficiencies of scale from employees staying at a long time. That is very similar to what Andrew was saying. I believe the higher wages to men who respect their employees and are happy et cetera, et cetera are a good investment, yielding indeed big dividends. So that's the point I'm trying to make is like, listen, you might want to think you're cutting costs, actually saving money by making your wages as low as possible? I would say that you're actually going to make less money because truly talented people like they know that there is a market for their skills. And so if you find people that are really good, you should do everything your power to keep them in your company because that -- it's -- look at it as more of an investment, not a cost. I think that's a mistake that Frick was making and maybe to a less degree Carnegie was making. And then finally, it's funny how the book ends. I'll close on this. The very last sentence, I'm going to read you the sentence and the note from, I guess, who ever published a book. He says nothing is impossible to a genius. Here, the manuscript ends abruptly. I just love that ending. Apparently, he was so distraught because of the outbreak of World War I and he got so involved in politics and everything else that he never got back around on completing his autobiography. So if you want to read the whole book, I'll leave a link in the show notes, you can just go to amazon.com/shop/founderspodcast. You can see this book and every single other book that I've done so far. And next week, I'm going to wrap up this 3-part series with a biography of Henry Frick. All right. Thank you very much for listening, and I'll talk to you next week.

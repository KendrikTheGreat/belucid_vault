"The actual arc of Barnum's life is much more interesting and much more consequential than his present-day reputation suggests. He may have begun his career as a promoter of sketchy acts in a business that was often considered less than respectable, but he changed both himself and the business over the decades, earning the respect of Americans of every station. Because he had so determinedly placed himself in the public eye, people knew all about his early missteps as well as his early successes. His struggles and his triumphs." "He did not hesitate to show his flaws, but he would also reveal in time that he was that rare thing, a man who was steered by his ideals, becoming a better person as he navigated a long lifetime. Over many years, Barnum became a steady, civic-minded, fun-loving man who cultivated a close relationship with his audience and embodied many of the best aspects of the American character. He eventually won over the public with his unflagging energy, his wit and his buoyant good humor, his patriotic zeal for the Union side in the Civil War and his commitment to charitable causes, good government and his faith." "He is known today primarily for his connection to the circus, but that only came in the last quarter of his life. His principal occupation before that was running the American Museum. Less well-known today is that he was also a best-selling author, an inspirational lecturer on temperance and on success in business, a real estate developer, a builder, a banker, a state legislator and the mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut. In all of these endeavors, he was a promoter and self-promoter without peer, a relentless advertiser and an unfailingly imaginative concocter of events or exhibits to draw the interest of potential patrons." "By the end of his life, he was admired and respected not only in the United States, but also across much of the globe. He had become as close to a global celebrity as a person could be at that time. After Ulysses S. Grant's second term as president, the great general made a two-year tour around the world, promoting the United States. Upon his return, Barnum said to him, 'General, I think you are the best-known American living,' to which Grant replied, 'By no means. You beat me sky-high. For wherever I went, the constant inquiry was, do you know Barnum?'" "Barnum, who was born 10 years into the century and died nine years before its end, embodied the period's great narrative of breaking social boundaries. Americans often sell him as an exemplar of what it meant to be one of them. Europeans saw him as a representative of the American character. He was born into a family that had to hustle in its small Connecticut village to stay solvent, do hard work, a lot of brass and a genius for exploiting the new technologies related to communication and transportation, he became world famous and wealthy beyond his dreams. And he did it all by appealing to popular taste and interests. He understood what ordinary Americans wanted." "Barnum embodied some of America's worst impulses, but also many of its best. He came to represent much of what was most admirable about his young country, and he did so with a sense of humor and a joy in living that is rare in today's public figures. He led a rich event-filled exhilarating life, one indeed characterized by both struggles and triumphs. His is a life well-worth knowing and celebrating."

That was an excerpt from the book that I'm going to talk to you about today, which is, P. T. Barnum: An American Life, and it was written by Robert Wilson. Okay. So let's jump into his earlier life. From a very young age, he realizes that he has an interest in earning money. And it says, "What did interest him from an early age was money and its accumulation. The boy decided that for extra money, he could start making sweets and selling them to soldiers on the day when the militia trains. So let me just pause there. He's about 12 years old at this point. And he -- remember, his life -- he was born in 1810 and he dies in 1891. So his life takes place -- a large part of his life when he's a young man, takes place post-American Revolution, but pre-Civil War. And so that's what they mean about the militia there. "Within a few years, he could afford to buy a sheep, a cow and other property." And the reason I'm telling you this is because this is how -- he's reflecting back. This author quotes heavily from Barnum's own autobiography. And this is what -- in his autobiography, this is what he says about this time in his life and about the earning of his own money, the impact it made on his mind. And he says, "It made me feel that it was quite a man of substance." And having this passion for commerce, for trying to make money winds up being beneficial because like a lot of people that we study in the podcast, his early life is filled with tragedy. So at 16 years old, his father dies, and this leaves him as the oldest child, the person that has to work to support his family. So it says, "Barnum's father died of a lingering illness, leaving his family with debts. Now the eldest of five children with the youngest only seven, Barnum remembered the family returning from the cemetery, 'To our desolate home feeling that we were forsaken by the world, and that but little hope existed for us on this side of the grave.'"

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So Barnum was born and raised in a small town in Connecticut. He needs -- he realizes, hey, there's no opportunity for me in this small town. Let me go to New York, where it's becoming a large city. There will be opportunities for me to run my business because he realizes even from an early age that he's not fit to work for other people. So he ends up moving to Brooklyn and he starts his own business. And what's remarkable about this section is: one, he had an insight into who he was at such a young age; but two, he's 17 years old when he starts his first business in New York. So it says, "Barnum soon decided to start a business of his own. My disposition is and ever was," he wrote, "Of a speculative character." Yes, that's an understatement. "And he knew even then that he would only be happy working for himself. He managed to pull together some money to buy a porterhouse for sale." And it says, "Despite" -- so he winds up borrowing some money, starts a small, little restaurant essentially. And -- but he doesn't -- we also see right here in this next sentence, an insight into who he was probably for his whole life. And this is something that, in some cases, can be a very positive attribute of this, but also later on leads to him essentially being bankrupt. I think he was almost 50 years old at the time. And this idea that he can never focus on just one thing. So it says, "Despite his resolution to run his own business, in only a few months, Barnum had the opportunity to sell the place at a profit, so he took it." So after he sells the business in New York, he goes back to Connecticut. He's got some uncles, he's got a grandfather. They all have stories of their own. He decides, hey, I'm going to do this as well. So first, he works with them for a little bit. He decides, hey, I'm going to open my own store. So at 21 years old, he opens his store, and this is what he learns from that. It says, "He opened a store in the summer of 1831, selling dry goods, groceries, and hardware. Everything" -- this is how he described the story later on in his autobiography. "Everything -- he sold everything from bibles to brandy." This business did not go as well as the porterhouse though and this is what he says. "Like most persons who engage in a business which they do not understand, we were unsuccessful in the enterprise."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he starts a lottery business. And the reason I'm bringing this up is because: one, he makes a ton of money at a very young age; but two, he's starting to realize -- this is going to set like seeds in his mind for his future entertainment empire because he's starting to realize people are hungry for more entertainment. At this point in American history, he's living in the Northeast. It's heavily religious. There was a lot of things you weren't allowed to do. The theater, for example, was thought of as a place for like lowlifes and people wanting to do drugs, prostitutes would hang out there, that kind of thing. So in his small town in Connecticut, what they would do for entertainment mostly was, after dinner, somebody in the family would read from the bible aloud. And so he's running this lottery business, and he's realizing, oh, what people are saying they like and what they actually like are not matching up. And so this is an example of that, and then this is going to lead him to realizing, hey, there's a huge opportunity here to entertain people outside of things that the church just thinks is moral. So it says, "His lottery work did not just teach him about the efficacy of advertising." That's something that characterize his entire career. He would advertise heavily because this is the beginning of what we consider like the mass media, and it's a way for him to accumulate customers extremely rapidly. So it says -- and that he starts -- he gets all the customers for his lottery business through advertising in the newspaper, but also for his museum and his shows and everything else. So it's something he uses his entire life. So anyways, "It also began to develop his insight into the complicated nature of his customers." This is something that was true then, it's still true today and will be true in the future. So I think it's very important for us to realize this. "A realization that outwardly respectable people might have interests that were not entirely respectable."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Buying a lottery ticket was after all, a form of gambling, something that the powerful churches looked down upon. Yet lotteries were popular not only among many churchgoers but also as Barnum reported, with a number of clergyman and deacons." So they'd get up, they preach, hey, don't gamble, don't gamble, but in their private lives, they're gambling, right? "With whom he counted among his private customers." So his private customers, he also gives examples in the book, where a husband goes and says, hey, I'm going to buy a ticket from you, Barnum. Don't tell my wife. A few hours later, the wife shows up. Hey, I'm going to buy a ticket from you, Barnum. Don't tell my husband. And so he's realizing, okay, what people say they like and what they actually like, what their actions reveal are very different. Where can I take this? So it says, "That also suggested a change in the social order of the day in which ordinary New Englanders were yearning for something more from their lives than what was being offered from the Sunday pulpit." So his -- Barnum's lottery business is massively successful. It generates a ton of money so he can also invest in other enterprises, right? Some of them are not profitable enough to stand on their own. One of the things he invests in is his own newspaper. So I'm going to tell you this story, but this is really the birth. He's in his early 20s at this point in his life. This is the day he becomes a showman. And so like I said before in the [indiscernible] podcast, newspapers in this time in history, like some of them made a ton of money, like unbelievable amount of money. William Randolph Hearst, who -- I'll read his biography and cover it in the next few weeks here, his net worth, which came from a network of newspapers is to be the equivalent of about $30 billion today. So you had a few that made a ton of money and then hundreds of newspapers that made no money. So Barnum's was in the latter. But what happens in this point in the story is, he starts a newspaper. He gets sued for libel and then he goes to jail. But that's -- so that's also -- that's interesting. But the most interesting part of that is we see this innate ability of showmanship because the day -- first of all, he's running his newspapers while he's in jail, but he organizes a parade for the day upon his release.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I'm just going to read this section to you. A lot of Barnum's life is just unbelievable. That's what it says. "He was convicted by a jury and sentenced that he can either pay court costs or serve 60 days in jail. "I choose to go to prison." So he's doing it almost as like a protest saying, "We share freedom of speech. I'm going to go to jail even though I don't have to." So he -- while he's in jail, he's running his newspapers. And he makes this like, hey, I'm a defender of free speech kind of thing, right? So it says, "His ability to marshal not just his own paper, but also the goodwill of others was a harbinger of things to come. It was the first clear example of -- for his flair for drawing attention to his beliefs, his enterprises, and himself." So he's writing to all these -- not only he's publishing in his own newspaper, but he's writing to other newspapers to tell his story, so they cover it in theirs, right? So it says, "His communications with the world beyond his cell also allowed him to stir up local newspaper coverage and to engineer what can only be called a local holiday to celebrate his release." And this is really truly remarkable. So I'm going to just give you the summary of what takes place after he get -- right when he's released. There's a ton of people that show up and it says -- and we also get insight into how extreme and the lengths he was willing to go on projects that he was interested in. "Others might have thought to sponsor an ode or an oration, engage a course or a band, plan a banquet or a parade, envision three cheers rather than three cheers twice, and might have forgotten the cannon salute altogether, but not Barnum." So they're saying, maybe you do one of these things. He's doing all of them simultaneously. "Seemingly small, but" -- and this is what we're learning about what he applies to his future work.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Seemingly small, but consequential details, like returning to the courtroom where he was convicted or overlaying it all with patriotic zeal would never elude him. This day had all the earmarks of a Barnum production. So he gets out, he's still running his newspaper, he's still making a ton of money running his lottery business, and then all of a sudden, they outlaw, the state outlaws -- they banned lottery. So it says, "The state legislature banned lotteries. And without any source of income, Barnum had to change course. He could afford to keep publishing his paper. He now had no resources. He blamed himself for his situation writing that the old proverb easy come, easy go was very true in my case." "Still" -- this is a really important aspect of his personality. He was an unyielding optimist. So it says, "Still he had -- he was confident in his ability to earn money." And so this up and down, down and up nature is prevalent throughout Barnum's life. He'll have massive success followed by years of no success. Eventually, like he will even it out a little bit as he gets older, but in his early ages, it's just -- he couldn't hold on to a good opportunity for very long. So he has these periods of time where he's got an abundance of money and then several years past where he has none of that. And so that's where we're in right now where he's looking for an opportunity, and I'll list all the different jobs later that he did. It's just -- it's remarkable how many different things he was trying to make money at. But this is -- I want to fast forward to the part of his life after a few years of struggle where he gets his first job as a showman, as a promoter. So it's important to understand at this point in time in history, this is what the author says, "Barnum's era was a heyday for human exhibitions, and he was happy to play his part." So what does that mean? There's not a lot of entertainment. So let's say, any kind of oddity. So you could have giants and dwarfs. People that weighed 600 pounds, people born with no arms.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

All kinds of -- anything that deviates at all from the norm, promoters and showman at the time would advertise heavily, they would dress them up in costumes and say, hey, for a quarter, for a nickel, for a shilling, whatever it is, you can come and be temporarily entertained. So this is the industry that Barnum is going to start working in. And this winds up being the, I would say, the one act: one, he makes a lot of money; but two, he becomes infamous for. This is something that he looks back as an older man and he's regretful. He's embarrassed. And so he's going to promote what he builds as George Washington's nanny. They called her nursemaid. And saying, hey, she's -- they say, she's 161 years old, and she helped raise the first president, right? And really, what this is really gross and distasteful for is that he essentially leased a slave and set up shows all across the country with this lie, right? And so it says, "The business finally came. I fell into the occupation and far beyond any of my predecessors on this continent, I have succeeded. So he's talking about, this is the beginnings of my career as a showman. It's something I did better than anybody else in the world later on, okay? But it says, "Barnum's admission at the event that would set his life on its course was the least deserving of all my efforts in the show line. By this, he meant in part that the elements for its success were already in place and required little creative showmanship on his part." "But it also became the episode of his life for which he was the least proud, one that spurred him to begin to be the better sort of showman that he would eventually become." So he had to learn how to be a good person. At the very beginning, the author talks about, what's remarkable is that he was one of the few people that actually realized, hey, I'm -- I have a lot of areas of my personality that are defective, things that I'm doing for money that are really gross. I need to change this. This is what they're referencing.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Not only does he make -- he makes like $10,000, which is a monumental amount of money at the time. You could buy, like, for example, he bought a store, like the land for his store from his uncle for like $50 at the time, to give you kind of a context into what $10,000 meant. But not only that. When this person dies, her name is Joice. When Joice dies, he sells tickets to her autopsy. And so we see a very deficient moral character that he works on and improves later in life. And this is one thing, again, that he looks back on with great shame in his life. And so eventually, Joice dies and then we see this up and down, down and up, and now he's going to go through years of struggle after this. He made a lot of money again and now back in the doldrum. So it says, "He struggled to find further success in the years that followed. Barnum would spend much of the five years, after the death of Joice, on the road with various acts ranging from dancers to a small circus. During this period, he would sometimes be away from home for a year or more. And each time he returned, he would say that his life on the road was over." "I was thoroughly disgusted with the life of a traveling showman. He was determined to settle into something more permanent in New York. And none of these activities brought him much money. So I'm going to fast forward to the point where he discovers -- his primary occupation for most of his life was owning the Barnum Museum, the American Museum in New York City, right? It wasn't until he was 60 years old that he starts getting involved in the circuits, which he's most famous for, right? But at this point, from the time he's about 25 to 31 years old, this is a list of jobs that Barnum tried. He was a dance troop promoter. He was a traveling showman, which I already told you about. He tried to manufacture cologne. He tried to manufacture something called bear's grease. He sold bibles. He was a clerk for a horse show. He was a copywriter, and he was a freelance fiction writer. So he's doing everything he possibly can and he's going to give us his own description about this period of his life, which was not very successful, not very happy.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"After a few months of barely getting by with these activities, months in which the family's health had" -- and he's got married. Now he's married with kids, "Had turned from excellent to poor. Barnum later wrote, I began to realize seriously that I was at the very bottom of fortune's ladder and that I had now arrived at an age when it was necessary to make one grand effort to raise myself above want. He heard that Scudder's American Museum was looking for a buyer. This collection of curiosities was located on Broadway in New York City." I just want to pause there just for a second, what he's saying there is, listen, I can't mess around anymore. I'm trying my hand at a million things. I'm not succeeding in anything. I have a wife and, I think, two children at this point to take care of. I've got to go for it. It's either now or never. And this is where he stumbles into what I would consider his life's -- his main life's work. He's going to always do more than one thing, but this is the one constant that he had in his life. So it says, "The museum was now for sale for $15,000. But even this was far more money than Barnum had at his disposal." "Since my recent" -- this is what he's saying about his financial situation at the time. "Since my recent enterprises had not indeed been productive and my funds were decidedly low. In one of the most famous passages from his autobiography, Barnum told a friend that he was hoping to buy the American Museum. When the incredulous friend asked, what with, Barnum replied," -- like how are you going to afford it, essentially? "Barnum replied, 'Brass.' For silver and gold, I have none." So what he's saying there is courage. I got to do this with gumption. I can't -- I got to be clever here. And this is the note I left myself on this section. He's very, very clever. Barnum is always clever. It's always more than what meets the eye with this guy. "It's a memorable line, and it's mostly true. He decided to seek out a complete stranger." So this is what he does that's really smart. He finds out who owns the actual building, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Who is -- this museum that's for sale, who is the leasing for? Who are they leasing the property from? And so he goes to this stranger, this guy named Francis. So he goes out. "He sought out a complete stranger who owned the building in which the museum was housed, with the quixotic goal of persuading him to buy the collection for him," meaning, the museum, "For him on credit," remember, he's got no money, "Arguing that he would be a more reliable tenant than the struggling Scudder family." So they're selling the business not because they're prospering. They're selling their business because it's not doing well. So Barnum goes and appeals to this guy's interest. He's like, do you want this massive building that you own to sit empty. No, you do not. So I can run this business. I can get customers. I can make it a profitable endeavor and if I'm profitable, then you have a tenant. So it says, "This against all the odds, Barnum was able to do." And that's another thing to note about Barnum, he was an extremely good talker. That phrase is in the book over and over again. He's an extremely good writer. He's very persuasive. And -- so much so that he -- part of the way he's able to, let's say, two or three decades in the story -- in the future from where we are in the story now, when he goes bankrupt, he gets out of bankruptcy in large part because he does this public lecture series. People will pay to hear him speak because they find him so fascinating, and he puts on such a good show. So -- but I want to talk about why -- like why was he able to build a successful museum where this previous owner, this previous family was not. And that goes back to the insights that he derived when he was running his lottery business. He's like, well, there's a growing middle class in America. And they clearly have this desire, this hunger for different forms of entertainment. So this section is about the customers that he wanted and how he positioned his product, which again, very, very clever on his part.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Barnum wanted to attract this rising middle class and the aspiring members of the surrounding neighborhoods. They had more money and were more likely to spend it on wholesome activity." So this is another thing to know about Barnum. Later in life, he wants to be thought of, very similar to almost like Walt Disney, like somebody that made wholesome family-friendly entertainment. So it says. They were more likely to spend it on wholesome activities. And with their higher rates of literacy, they were more susceptible to newspaper advertising." So that's how he's going to make them aware of his endeavors. "As Barnum begin to add to the museum's collection, he continued the institution's long tradition of emphasizing exhibits that would both entertain and make his customers think." He wanted to also educate them, right? "So many newcomers and tourists in New York, then as now, were drawn to the city by its promise, not just of excitement, but also of a connection to a wider world than the one on view back home. Barnum had an ambitious plan for satisfying this hunger to learn. He aimed to acquire at least one example of every single thing in existence living or dead." So that's a marketing speech. I mean, that's obviously impossible, but that's what he went on telling people, right? "In the 1820s, a Scudder Museum advertisement had claimed 150,000 items in its collection. By the 1860," so 40 years later, "Barnum would advertise that the museum contained a million wonders." And this is all kind of just the most bizarre things from plants to animals to fake mermaids, which I was going to later. Just any possible weird thing that may get somebody to stop in their tracks and think, hey, what is that? That's essentially what he's building here. "It was almost impossible" -- well, I guess, I'm running over my own point here. "It was almost impossible to describe the breadth of what the museum held even before Barnum acquired it and began energetically adding to its exhibits." So he would travel all over the world and just look for the most outrageous things, buy them and bring them back.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"After he had been at it for a few years, the task became so hopeless as to be laughable." Okay. So one of his most famous exhibits that he was known for is this thing called the Fiji mermaid. I'm going to give you a description of what it actually is and then I want to talk to you about how Barnum planned and publicized his show. The details in his machinations are amazing. There's a lot to learn from this guy. So it says -- this is a weird -- I underlined this section when I was reading it even before we get into like how he markets it because I'm like, what? Let me just read it to you and then I'll tell you what I thought. So it says, this actual thing that he's proposing to be a mermaid is a very old thing, has been passed around the world, right? And other people, even 100 years before something like that had put it on display and sold tickets to it, right? So Barnum is going to wind up doing the same thing. He just does it on a different level than everybody else. So it says, "It had been skillfully assembled from parts of an orangutan, a baboon and a salmon." So somebody put the bottom half of what a mermaid, like you have like the fin or like the, I guess, the fish part of a salmon, right, as the mermaid's tail. And then the top half is the combination of orangutan and baboon. "Her eyes were fake, her nails were made of horn or quill. Her breasts had been stuffed so that they hid the scene between the ape and the fish where they sowed them together." And then there was like a postmortem done on it. So it's like, the person performing had been able to feel where the bones of the arms had been sewed to make the proportions closer to that of a human rather than an orangutan. So they're saying that's what a mermaid is. It's half human, half fish, right? In this case, it's orangutan, baboon and salmon. So I read that, I'm like, there's a human being at some point that had access to all these different -- who has access to orangutan and baboon parts and then I guess, the fish is easier to run into. And then takes the time to sew them together and to put it together, like this is just a really strange behavior by our species here. So that's what the actual thing is.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This is what Barnum -- he has another friend that runs a museum. He says, hey, I came across this. Do you want it? Barnum says, yes. And this is what he does and how he actually markets it. So this is the interesting part. "He hatched a complicated plan for engaging the public's curiosity about what he's calling the Fiji mermaid," okay? "Barnum's scheme to start the ball rolling was to have friends in other cities forward letters to New York newspapers that Barnum himself had secretly written." So there's no friends. He does this over and over again in his life. Everything he does is like this, okay, what I'm about to describe to you. He just does -- he takes things so much further than anybody else. So he writes a bunch of letters, he mails them to friends that live all over the country, and they mail them. So it's postmarked. And it comes -- so the New York newspaper is like, oh, look, there's a guy in Charleston. Oh, look, there's a guy in Georgia. And they're talking about this traveling oddity that's making its way to New York. He's sowing the ground here, right? "The letters were" -- and then he hides it into -- so he has this thing, hey, there's a mermaid. This is a real mermaid that's coming to New York City, you might want to check it out. But they don't just write letters on that. That's too obvious. He hides his intentions with like a collection of other news in there, right? So it says, "The letters were constructed as a miscellanea of local news in which was included an item about the recent visit of Dr. J. Griffin, who represented," which they didn't know, it's fictional, it doesn't even exist, "The Lyceum Natural History Museum in London." "The naturalist was reportedly on his way to New York and then to London with a mermaid taken from the Fiji Islands and preserved in China, where the doctor had bought it at a high figure for his London employer. Barnum's hoaxes were always certain to mention the great expense involved in the procurement of any exhibit." So that's something he also does for his whole life. A detail meant to distinguish his offerings from the run-of-the-mill c_*_. That's not the word they use, but that's what they mean.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He also tucked in the winning and irrelevant detail that the aptly named Dr. Griffin was recently from Pernambuco, an exotic and mildly romantic name to the American ear even if the possessor of that ear didn't know that this is actually a real place in Brazil. So he always makes things. He wants you to know, hey, it's exotic and it's expensive, right? "His careful attention to such seemingly small matters, similar to that he had shown in planning the celebration of his release from jail years before, undoubtedly distinguished him from others in his line of work." A different newspaper fell for this and published each of these letters. So not the same newspaper. So he's going to get free newspaper coverage from multiple newspapers. They're all falling for the same trap, right, "In which the non-mermaid news was plausible enough. And in the third letter, the writer suggested that the New York editors really ought to go out and see this specimen for themselves. Before that would happen, a meeting was arranged with local reporters in Philadelphia, where they were introduced to the mermaid and to Dr. Griffin, who was in reality none other than Levi Lyman, which is Barnum's employee." "Barnum reports with evident satisfaction that the plan worked admirably, and the columns in Philadelphia papers served to further entice the New York press." So after this happens, it says, "New York newspapermen were clamoring to see the mermaid. In the meantime, Barnum commissioned highly idealized engravings of beautiful, full breasted, unclothed mermaids with flowing blond hair, clearly meant to imply that this is what the Fiji mermaid had once looked like. He added write-ups 'proving' the authenticity of these formerly fictional characters." "Barnum offered three" -- we're going to see more of his machinations here, right? "Barnum offered three different New York papers exclusive access to one of the images and a report, which he modestly acknowledged was well-written. All three papers ran the exclusive on the same Sunday morning." So the show hasn't started yet, but he's not done promoting.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, "At this point, Barnum released for sale on the streets, at $0.01 a piece, 10,000 copies of a pamphlet that contained all of the images and stories he had prepared. Then he rented the concert hall on Broadway and placed advertisements in the paper saying, Dr. Griffin and the mermaid would be on exhibit positively for one week only." So he's got a fundamental understanding of salesmanship and human nature. He does this over and over again. He says, okay, I'm going to have this exhibit. It's only going to be here for one week and then it's going to go to London. And then when the week is up, he says, oh, the ship is delayed. It's going to be here for another three days, jump on it. Oh, okay, it's going to be here for another two days. It leaves like two months later. So he understands that when you tell people, hey, you have a finite amount of time to do this. They're more likely to act now, which is exactly what he wants. It says, "When the week was up, Barnum was ready to advertise that he acquired the mermaid. He owned the mermaid the whole time. He had acquired the mermaid for a precious sum, of course. There's that same MO there, mentioning how much money it cost him, for his museum where it would be displayed at no charge beyond the usual admittance fee of $0.25. So think about how much publicity that he rounded up for the mermaid. And then after the fact, he'll say, oh, don't worry, the week is up, but guess what, I own it now, just come to my museum. It's only $0.25. And you could see 150,000, 200,000, 500,000 things you've never seen in your life. And so the author quotes -- this author quotes heavily from Barnum's own autobiography, and this is Barnum in his autobiography writing later on, like looking back at this point of his life. He says, "He wrote that his purpose of displaying the mermaid had been mainly to advertise the regular business of the museum." So that's what he's saying, this is the whole point of me doing all this, right? This was my plan the whole time. "He considered it effective, indirect advertising." Remember that. He talks about indirect advertising all the time, not in his words, but in his actions.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It says, "He's compelled to point out that as the" -- he also -- he puts it in the museum and then he sends it off for traveling shows. And what happens is people see it, maybe 500 miles from New York City. When they go back to New York City, they're going to know, hey, American Museum, Barnum Museum, I should go there. So it says, "He's compelled to point out that as the exhibits subsequently traveled the country, the fame of the museum wafted from one end of the land to the other. And he knew that every dollar that he sold on advertising would return in tens, and perhaps hundreds of dollars in a future harvest." And one thing to know about Barnum is, he never rests on his laurels. He's always constantly charging -- challenging himself rather. And I'm going to fast forward in the story. He does an extremely successful turnaround of the museum. So he goes from being broke, in debt to within two years, making the money and paying off his debts. And he decides, hey, I'm going to take -- I'm going to start -- I want to be world -- like I want to be known all over the world, not just in America. So he's going to travel to England. He starts crying because of this too. So it says, "All those tears, that mixture of joy and regret suggest that he was honestly sorry to be leaving his wife, children and members of his broader family in the comfortable home and work that he had built for himself in just two years. He had now paid off all of his debts from the museum and created a handsome surplus in the treasury." That's Barnum's words. "He now felt confident in his success and believed that his business has long ceased" -- this is a really interesting way to think about it. He didn't know when he bought the museums that it's going to be successful. So he calls it an experiment. But now once your business is on solid footing, it's obviously different, right? So he says, "He now felt confident in his success and believed that his business had long ceased to be an experiment and was now in perfect running order. He had realized his ambitions in an amazingly short amount of time." Obviously, he went through years of struggle before he did that. So it's saying, short amount of time in the sense that he turned it around in only two years. "The challenge was a new place itself, a place that he had no notion of who P. T. Barnum was, whether or not he would succeed in the land of his forbearers would be a test for Barnum of his own worth and how far he had come or how far he might yet go."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So what he's doing at this time, he's running the museum, but he also runs across a lot of people, send them -- say, hey -- they know he's attracted to oddities because that's what his museum is about. So there is this -- I don't remember the name of the disease, but essentially, it's -- you just stop growing at a certain age, almost like a -- I'm was going to use an example like Benjamin Button, but that's not a good example because he goes from being old to like a baby. But essentially, somebody starts -- stops growing, this perfectly proportioned little human called Tom Thumb. And he's maybe six, eight years old, something like that when Barnum starts putting him on display, but he looks like a little fully formed human. And so anyways, Tom would dress up at costumes, he would do imitations, he'd put on like a show. And he became really popular. So P. T. Barnum has the idea. He's like, hey, I'm going to take this show to Europe. And so that's what's happening at this time of the story. And so he's met with massive success in Europe. Tom Thumb winds up performing for the royal families in, I think, England and France. It just -- it's remarkable. He winds up performing for Abraham Lincoln back in America. It's remarkable, all people's lives that Barnum intersected with, which I'll tell you a little bit more about -- I'll tell you more about later. But I want to hit on this story right here because it gives you an insight into his personality and just how full of energy that this person -- that Barnum had. And so there's a writer in England called Albert Smith, and he spent a day sightseeing and shopping with Barnum, okay? So Barnum is out there looking for stuff for his museum. And it starts at 5 a.m. when Barnum starts knocking on Smith's door. At 5 a.m., he's like, all right, let's get going and Smith is like, who is this crazy character. So it says, "Smith wrote" -- this is now Albert Smith reflecting on this crazy day that he spent with Barnum.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Smith wrote that he saw more in that day than in any other day of his life and over supper, Barnum told him that a person must make 30 hours out of 24 or he would never get ahead. There was a bull in the China shop aspect to his sketch of Barnum, whose energy and self-confidence were portrayed as overwhelming to the point of rudeness at times." So I'm going to fast-forward to the end of his time in Europe. I just -- it's mind-boggling how profitable some of Barnum shows could be. Remember, he's just a promoter. So he promotes Tom Thumb. He promotes another like Swedish singer. And every time, he makes tens of millions of dollars, in many cases, making way more than the actual talent. So it says, "Tom Thumb would spend three years touring the British Isles, France and Belgium. Barnum would make more than" -- so he does the math for us. "Barnum would make more than $10 million in today's dollars." And they do that very, very quickly. So one thing to know about Barnum at this time is, he's completely focused on work. He's kind of -- he's not paying attention to his family. He's traveling all the time. He's drinking a lot and he talks about every day at lunch, he'd have two or three bottles of wine or champagne and be so drunk that he wouldn't -- he'd be so drunk that he says, the desire to work would like flee him, right? And so he winds up giving up drinking. And this is where we learn more of his negative traits, definitely gigantic ego. He could be rude. He would be drunk all the time. But we also see that he has an ability to course correct, which is what the author was referencing at the beginning of the book that this is a very imperfect person, but we see that he actually makes efforts to improve his life, to take in new information and realize, hey, I'm screwing myself over here. Like if I keep this up, I'm not going to like the path of where my life goes. So it says, "When he returned home and told his wife," her name is Charity, "What he had done," meaning, he gave up drinking, "I was surprised to see tears running down her cheeks.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"She astonished him by saying that she had cried on many nights worrying that his drinking would lead -- his wine bibbing and drinking was leading me to a drunkard's path. I reproached her for not telling me her fears, but she replied that she knew I was self-diluted and that any such hint from her would have been received in anger." So he says -- this is what the author is saying, "That he could reproach her and that she could profess to be afraid of his reaction adds more paint strokes to the unflattering self-portrait of the husband Barnum had become." So he's getting high on his own supplies, like people celebrate me everywhere I go, they clamor for me. I'm getting all this adulation, all this attention. I'm making tons of money. I'm getting drunk. I'm doing whatever I want to do. And not realizing, hey, I'm a terrible husband, and I'm going to wind up going down this terrible path. So it says, "Still, making a resolution not to drink and then keeping it took both discipline and self-awareness and constituted another serious effort to turn his marriage and himself around. That was the end of my drinking, he wrote." "The feeling of a relief that came from forswearing alcohol gave his life a new sense of purpose. I have been groping in darkness, he remembered. I was rescued and I knew it was my duty to try and save others, like any evangelist and true to his industrious nature." That's an understatement. "He was now full of the spirit and could not stop spreading it." So he goes around, and he does this for free at the beginning and then eventually gets paid to do so, and he just gives tons of lectures. And he essentially is just like a preacher or a pastor who is trying to convert you to their religion. He's doing the same thing. He's trying to get people to give up drinking, to be temperate. And again, like I said before, this actually becomes very lucrative for him, and it is a way that he's able to recover from bankruptcy. It takes a lot of years, it takes like five years, he winds up having to work to build back his wealth.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So now he's talking about the most successful time he ever had as a promoter and he's going to promote this Swedish singer named Jenny Lind. And I want to tell you a little bit more about -- well, let me just read this. It says, "The new venture would put to use all of his skills and imagination as a promoter." She's very successful in Europe, and he's the one that convinces her to come to America and he makes -- they make a ton of money. "It would also give him a chance to move beyond the days of Joice Heth," that's the George Washington's nanny fake story, "The Fiji mermaid and even the most famous little man in the world," that's Tom Thumb, "To establish himself as something more than a mere promoter, a serious purveyor of highbrow culture. It would also conveniently make him far, far, far richer than he'd ever been." So I read that section. I was like, well, that's a little bit derogatory the use of the word promoter there, but I really think that we're all promoters. I've been thinking a lot about like the people we study on the podcast, like Estee Lauder. She was a promoter of beauty, right? Larry Ellison was a promoter of the efficiency gains of software and of winning. Henry Ford was a promoter of service. Claude Shannon is a promoter of following your own curiosity. So to me, promoting is just sharing what you love. And so I think that's the way I would look at it. Now in P. T. Barnum's case, he never -- he signs her to this extremely lucrative contract. And she's like, where have you heard me sing? And he's like, I haven't heard you sing. I'm just doing this. I'm taking this huge gamble, because he was definitely a gambler, just based on your reputation. So in this specific example, he's not promoting something he loves other than the fact that he does want to be respected and he wants to make a lot of money. But in most of his life, he is promoting just wholesome good family fun, that's the way he would describe it, and entertainment.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And again, he builds a wonderful life for himself just off that very simple idea that I'm going to promote various forms of entertainment so people can enjoy their time. And I just think that's a very simple idea. And if you take it to extremes, like P. T. Barnum does, like you can build a life around that. So one thing I do want to tell you about this promotion of Jenny Lind is that he just -- Barnum has never -- I'm going to read this section to you. But what I want you to keep in mind is like, everything Barnum does is just like this. He has never focused on the obvious. He's always focused on like the second order effect. He's always -- the interpretation of the customer, what they think is happening is so much more complex from Barnum's perspective. And it just -- it is really impressive how he's able to think through and get attention for what he's working on. So he has this idea, he's like, okay, well, Jenny Lind is super famous. She's in America now. I'm promoting her. How can I get even more attention to make sure that there's going to be thousands of tickets -- thousands of more people than ticket available for every show? And he comes up with this idea of getting publicity by doing -- raffling off a ticket, right? And so it says, "One of Barnum's most successful publicity gambits had been the auction of the first ticket," right? So he says, the very first ticket, before it's available to buy to somebody else, I'm going to make you guys bid on that. And it's going to be so interesting that the newspapers are going to report because the price -- ticket prices are going to be crazy because, for example, at the time, you can see a show for $0.25, $0.50, maybe $1. Some of these tickets go for like $650. So the newspapers are going to cover it. Not only are they're going to cover it because it gives publicity to Barnum's show, but it gives publicity to the person that does the bid. So you have people that wind up buying the ticket and not even going to the show because they just wanted their name and their business in the newspaper.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, "One of the most successful publicity gambits had been the auction of the first ticket. Ticket auctions were not his invention, but his goal was lest the dollar amount he could squeeze out of the sale and more the publicity he could aspire. He persuaded his next-door neighbor, a hatter," meaning, he makes hats, "Named John Gannon to go all out at the auction so that he could too -- so that he could soak up some of the publicity it generated." So he's -- again, it's very hard to believe like -- this old saying, like believe nothing of what you hear and half of what you see. Same thing. People -- like Barnum set up his auction. He's convinced like the person is going to win. He already knows who's going to win because he said, hey, no matter what, bib, bid, bid. And so the people say, like oh, my god, who's this guy. This guy bought this ticket, and it winds up building -- making this guy's hat business even larger. So it says, "He gets -- he persuaded his next-door neighbor," okay, "To go all out at the auction so he could, too, soak up some of the publicity it generated. The scheme worked out at least as well for hat sales as it did for ticket sales." Gannon received national attention for his winning bid and owning a Gannon hat became a sign of sophistication. This made him as rich as he was well-known." So that's the very first time he does it. So Jenny does, let's say, 100 shows before she part ways with Barnum. And eventually, people realize, oh, it worked for the hat guy, it would work for me and so they start bidding up just to win. And then, like I said before, they'll win the auction and then in many cases not even go to the show. So his promotion of Jenny Lind makes him a ton of money. I'm talking about tens of millions -- the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars, which is bizarre, right, because I told you he goes bankrupt. Well, he goes bankrupt after the fact. He winds up building -- this is even before the Jenny Lind thing, but he winds up building one of the most ostentatious houses that have ever existed. It's called Iranistan. You can Google image search this thing. This is -- it looks like a house that P. T. Barnum would build is the point.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But my point is, like he was very ostentatious, he would spend a lot of money, and then he could not just focus on one business. So he winds up going broke, not because of -- not just of his like ostentatious spending, but because he just invested in a ton of things that never made any money. And so this is another example of this up and down, down and up lifestyle that he had. And I think it's a reminder of what Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett told us, that you need to stay within your circle of competence. If he stayed to promoting shows, to running a museum, he'd never have this problem. But it says, "Barnum had been working at a dizzying number of ventures. When those projects relied on his instincts and experience as a showman, they tended to be successful. But when he was tempted by schemes in areas which he was less familiar, the results were uneven. Eventually, as his attention turned in so many directions and he bankrolled so many initiatives, his long run of good luck would come to an end." So some of these things, he dumps a lot of money in real estate development. Think of it almost like start-up investing now, all these weirdoes were coming to him with ideas for a business. He gives them money. The business fails. There's a thing called a Fire Annihilator because Barnum experienced like five devastating fires in his life, houses burned down, businesses burn down, et cetera, et cetera. Fire Annihilator didn't work. Fire Annihilator, the building that the devices were being made in burned to the ground. He got involved in the manufacturing of clocks, just all kinds of bad businesses. Spent a ton of money on them, guaranteed all these loans and then he goes bankrupt. "Having made so much money from his museum, Tom Thumb and Jenny Lind, he became increasingly eager to leverage his wealth in new speculations, but he became increasingly careless about how he did so. Once involved, he was lax about keeping tabs on his investments." He had ADD. He just moved -- he's like, just give him a bunch of money, move on to the next thing.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He does that for a little bit, and they all go -- then they all go out of business. He's like, oh, my god, what happened. And he says, he makes the claims that he was surprised that he went bankrupt. "His financial situation was so complicated that he was forced to file bankruptcy. His bankruptcy came to be a complete shock. He said that his agent brought him the refreshing intelligence that I was a ruined man." And as you can imagine, being world famous and now broke, he's going to be really depressed. He was forever an optimist who doesn't stay down long, but anybody that goes through this can be expected to be down and depressed. So it says, "He added that he was once more nearly at the bottom of the ladder. Having a hard time adjusting to the loss of their elegant home and servants, he wrote that his own constitution over the last few months had most seriously failed. He was understandably, if uncharacteristically, in the depths," meaning depressed. "Barnum's financial misfortune inspired the glee of those who had long despised what he stood for, as well as those who would no longer felt the economic need to pretend to be his friend." So during this time, he loses a bunch of money and realizes, oh, these people that I thought were my friends are not my friends. They just -- they pretended to be because I could do something for them. It says, "He had also become a morality tale of a man brought down by his own vanity." Now here's the weird thing though. So he realized he has a bunch of fake friends, but he also has a bunch of real friends. And some of the people are offering him loans and to raise money for him are very well-known and famous in their own right. This name is going to surprise you. I've done two episodes about him in the podcast. "Many people approach to lend him or give him money to get back on his feet or organize public benefits for him. A letter signed by more than 1,000 New Yorkers. Among them, Cornelius Vanderbilt, appeared in New York papers in early June, expressing support and proposing benefits on his behalf." And Barnum's response to this, I absolutely love. He says, "With some exceptions, Barnum's declined these many outpourings of financial support publicly stating, while favored with health, I feel competent to earn an honest livelihood for myself and family."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"He was and had every right to be proud of the things he had accomplished largely on his own and that pride and self-confidence that went with it were not likely to evaporate even in his moment of distress." So what is he saying? I did it before, I will do it again. I am not going to quit. So now it gets to the point I mentioned earlier, he just starts giving these lectures. Not only on -- he wrote several books on his life. One of them is, The Art of Money Getting. And he will give a lecture on that, he'll give lecture on not drinking. So it says, "Barnum now reinventing himself again as public lecturer. He took the advice of American friends in London to give a talk called The Art of Money Getting. The basis for the talk would be a list of 10 rules for business success that Barnum had created," this is a few years in the past, "For a prolific Philadelphia author named Edwin Freedley, who published the list in his 1853 book, A Practical Treatise on Business." He would deliver the speech nearly 100 times in the first five months of 1859. And Barnum would tell you that he had to go through this experience to go bankrupt after a massive success as an older man. He's almost 50 years old. And this is what he learned from this humbling experience. So he says, "He acknowledged the business activity as a necessity of my nature and emphasized that on the cusp of 50 years of age, he had no desire to retire." "His natural inclination for business would never leave him and given his genius for it, he will continue to accumulate dollars. He would -- it led him to believe that his troubles had been God's way of teaching him to be a better person. And in the three decades left to him, he managed in this regard to do what he saw as God's will. The charitable way in which his true friends had treated him, offering him loans and even offering to buy up his debt and allowing him to discharge it at less than its face value, also made an impression on him."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"He's quip about him being nothing without Charity seems to have been a lesson he now took to heart. He would become more generous in his dealings with others. And as his wealth accumulated again, he would give more and more of it away." So at this point in his life, he's giving lectures. He writes -- he's still got his museum. He starts getting involved in the circus business, which I'll tell you little bit more about that. But he also wrote and updated several times his autobiography. And this just gives you an idea of how world-famous Barnum was at the time. In the 1800s, his autobiography sold over one million copies. That's insane. And there were unexpected positive externalities from that book. One of them is, he meets -- he winds up -- I'm going to read this section to you first. It says, "John Fish, a wealthy cotton mill owner attributed his success in business to having read Barnum's first autobiography." So Barnum goes around, writes his book and then gives lectures, right? And people buy tickets, and they meet Barnum. "They had met in 1858 when Fish introduced himself after one of Barnum's lectures and he professed his admiration for the showman which began their friendship." Barnum's wife dies. Barnum still has about 20 years left in his life. He winds up marrying this guy's daughter. This guy's 23-year-old daughter. Barnum is like 60 at the time. So Fish and Barnum also become friends. They wind up touring. They wind up meeting up with General Custer. I cannot get over the people -- the historical people that Barnum interacted with. And they go Buffalo hunting together with Custer right before he dies. So anyway, he's doing a bunch of different things. He's back on his feet. And I like this section because it's just a reminder that I think it's human nature. We all need something to do. We -- I think to fill fulfilled, we need a means to contribute.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, "It's tempting to see his burst of energy at the beginning of Barnum's second career, the one he's more famous for today, as a circus man rather than a showman. But these activities were continuous with those he had been pursuing for more than three decades and represented the end of one of the few efforts at which he had not fully succeeded, being retired." He tried to retire. He just couldn't do it. "Barnum would not stop being a showman, public lecturer, real estate investor for any part of his attempted retirement." "But the slower pace that had left him with more time on his hands was he now realized at the ripe old age of 60, not for him." He tried to slow down. He had no interest. He wasn't happy about it. "It wasn't that he was incapable of leisure for he never stopped enjoying the pleasures of city life or of warm friendships, yet he always needs -- he always seemed to need a clear project to occupy him." And he works, as you will see, up until the day he dies. So I mentioned earlier, the fact that his autobiography sold so many and influenced so many people. I read this section, I was like, where do I know this name from, and you'll get it here. So it says, "Samuel Clemens began an after-dinner habit of reading from Barnum's recently published Struggles and Triumphs." So that's the new name of his autobiography, Struggles and Triumphs. "The book made an impression on Clemens, encouraging him in the years ahead as he promoted himself as a public lecturer and as the writer Mark Twain." So I realized, I was like, wait a minute, where have I heard of Clemens before. That's Mark Twain's real name. So it said, "Barnum's autobiography meant so much to him that when Clemens felt death nearing in the autumn of 1909," this is it's like 20 years after Barnum dies, and took a -- so he says, "It meant so much to him that when Clemens felt he was near death, he says, he took a dying man's solace in rereading his favorite books, Barnum's autobiography was among them." What I really loved about this book is everybody thinks of -- I think Barnum today is way -- he's way better known as Barnum & Bailey, the circus, everything else, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And as we see, that was not the majority of his life. It started after he was 60. And really Bailey, his younger partner by like 20 years was there on running the business. And so the majority of this book is all about Barnum's early life, which is why I think I enjoyed reading the book so much. And Bailey and the circus is literally one chapter right before the end. So I just want to tell you a little bit about how they came to meet. And again, I think Barnum had a good idea here. He just realizes this, I don't have a monopoly on good ideas. So there is this company called the Great London Circus, which is run by this guy named Bailey and a few of his partners. And they have -- they bought an elephant and an elephant and her calf, become like world famous. And so Barnum approaches him, he's like, I want to buy your elephant for my circus because he's running a circus with these other guys that aren't really good at what they're doing, okay? So it says, "He telegrammed Bailey and all these other people offering $100,000 in cash. And this is how Barnum remembers this. "They gleefully rejected my offer, pleasantly told me to look to my laurels, and wisely held on to their treasure. Not only that, but they began an advertising campaign under the heading, what Barnum thinks of the baby elephants, reproducing his telegram with its lavish offer. Barnum was also impressed by how well the three younger men had turned the tables on him using his own methods." "These were foes worthy of my steel," he called them. "The Great London Circus had dodged Barnum's circus -- had dogged," excuse me, "Barnum's Circus in the previous season, often scheduling dates in the same towns to draw off his business, something like a younger Barnum would have done." And so he says, "The aging showman realized that he finally met his match and he concluded it would be wiser to join them than to continue competing with them."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so that business, Barnum & Bailey Circus, Ringling Brothers, the greatest show on earth, whatever you happen to know about it, it lasted for 100 years. It just ended recently in 2017. And Barnum largely let Bailey run it. I got to see if there's a biography on him because he just seems to be a very formidable and clever person. And at this stage in Barnum's life, Bailey can run the day-to-day, Barnum can still do the promotions, still leverage all of like his celebrity, leverage his contacts in the media. But Bailey is really the one responsible for the massive business success that Barnum & Bailey wind up being. And so I want to close on this. He's -- right before he dies, he's giving an interview to a New York newspaperman, who -- he told the reporter, and he says in the last great understatement of his life that he was always glad to meet a newspaperman. That's an understatement, as he says. So it says, "Two days after the interview, he asked Nancy" -- that's his second wife, the one he was married to for the last 20 years of his life. "Two days after this interview, he asked Nancy to stay with him every moment of the little time that is left. And at midnight on the following day, his heartbeat grew irregular." "Those in the family not already present were wired that his hours left on earth were few. Soon, his heart began to beat faster and faster and then slower and slower. And just after 6:30 p.m. on April 7, he died. The newspapers that had been his lifeblood did not desert Barnum upon his death. The New York Times weighed in with a 6,000-word obituary and the Times of London called him an almost classical figure. Hundreds of newspapers across America shared the sad news with the millions of their readers who had visited the American Museum in their youth or more recently attended a Barnum & Bailey extravaganza in their city or town."

"Barnum rested at last, but the spectacle he had created would, decade after decade, continue to bear his name and delight the millions who would see it." What a remarkable life story.

TEST2

Jerry Jones lived a wild life, and this book is full of unbelievable stories of deals and risks that Jerry took during his career. My daughter went to Stanford. I couldn't stand it. She was so far from Arkansas. So I'd think of reasons to make trips out there to try to come up with a little business or something. I'd go out there with her, and I got an old office downtown in Palo Alto, and I said, "You know, I need to get some things going out here if I'm going to spend this kind of time." So I went over to Brentwood, about 20 or 30 miles from San Francisco, and I bought 25 lots, like I was going to build 25 houses, except I drilled four gas wells. And those four gas wells, in 18 months, paid me enough money for me to buy the Dallas Cowboys. Paying attention to my kids actually led me to getting involved in the passion of my life. And all along, what I was trying to do was hang out near my daughter. A lot of things happen that you didn't have planned or you don't have the strategy for. Now, I'm not saying I've done anything right, but I made up my mind a long time ago that I was going to work with my kids. They're involved in everything. They're involved in my leasing, oil and gas, real estate. And so when I got the Cowboys, I got it so that we could all work together. I thought I was doing it for them, but the one that got the most out of it was me. You're going to be sitting here in a hospital sometime in the future, lying here sometime in the future, and this room is going to be full of your business associates and the people you worked with all your life. And more than likely, your children and your family are going to be there because they're your children and your family. But you could have them there because they're the people that you spent your life with—the ones you worked with, the ones you fell down with, the ones you got up with, not just seeing them on Thanksgiving and Christmas. That's who you want to be with. So when that time comes, it's a celebration of your life, and you're not wishing you spent a little more time seeing a few more suns come up. That's the trip. That's the trip. Because that's going to be your glory. I'm pretty proud of them Cowboys. I'm pretty proud of the stuff that we've done in oil and gas. It pales in comparison to how proud I am to have lived my life working with my kids. You've got a chance to do something about that. I hope you will. That was not an excerpt from the book I'm going to talk to you about today. That was actually Jerry Jones on this show called Landman, which is about the Texas oil and gas industry. And I thought that clip was so moving, it piqued my interest to learn more about the life of Jerry Jones. He's obviously a well-known figure, and I assumed that there was going to be, you know, a bunch of biographies or maybe even an autobiography written by him. Turns out there's not many books on him at all. I was able to find one that was published all the way back in '95. So that's the book I'm going to talk to you about today, which is King of the Cowboys: The Life and Times of Jerry Jones, and it was written by Jim Dent. Before I jump into the book, I did some other research and pulled out a few quotes and stories from his life that aren't in the book that I want to start with. It gives you kind of an overview of some of the things I think are important to learn about him. I just absolutely love this. It says Jerry Jones doesn't like to waste time. On the rare occasion he hits the golf course, he's been known to close a business deal by the first hole, shake hands, and then walk off saying, "Why would I play another four hours when the deal was done?" Tales abound of 4 a.m. phone calls from Jones, leaving those on the other end unsure if he's just waking up or if he hasn't gone to bed yet. That is a recurring theme throughout the entire book—that he pushes himself. He's one of the most driven people I've ever met, and he has the ability to survive and thrive on very, very limited sleep. So, in this case, he's not waking up at 4 a.m.; he hasn't gone to bed yet. Such restless energy and single-minded drive have defined Jerry Jones for decades. You talk about the fact that he's this collection—his persona is part high-stakes entrepreneur (which is really reflected in the amount of risk this guy takes, which is just absolutely incredible). We'll talk a lot about that today. Part high-stakes entrepreneur, part football evangelist, and part showman. He's definitely got a P.T. Barnum-esque showmanship; he's a very gifted storyteller and raconteur, too. Something I want to talk to you a lot about is the fact that his family—his parents—involved him in the family business from a very young age, even when that business started from a very humble beginning. He says, "My parents were entrepreneurs. If you just worked hard enough, then you had real opportunity." That was instilled in me at a very early age. His father is the most influential person in his life. His mom describes Jerry and his father later on in the book as twins, and so he says he credits his father with teaching him not only to embrace work, but also to never resent it. One formative anecdote stands out in Jones's memory. After a bruising high school football loss, he came home demoralized and went straight to bed. Pat Jones found his son in bed and delivered a stern bit of advice: "Son, if you lie in this bed, you're going to be a loser for the rest of your life. Now get up, and if the team asks you to be the water boy, then drown them with the damn water." Jerry Jones got out of bed and never forgot that lesson.

And then, just one more quote that I want to read to you before we jump into the book again—I think it's really important, and he does believe this is in his blood. Direct quote from Jerry Jones: "By instinct, we Joneses, we're risk takers. To win big, you have to play the big hand." So, I want to start talking about his intense drive throughout the book. Jerry has phenomenal relationships, and he winds up building friendships and partnerships with some of the most successful entrepreneurs of his day. And one of them is his longtime friend, Don Tyson. So, Don Tyson had the nickname "the Chicken King," which I thought was humorous. It says Tyson is one of America's wealthiest men, having built his chicken empire from scratch more than 40 years ago in Springdale, Arkansas. Actually, he scaled it. He passed away a few years ago, but he wound up scaling the chicken business to over $10 billion a year in revenue. And this is what he said about his friend, Jerry Jones. Tyson talks about Jones: "This is one of the most driven men you will ever meet. Here is the guy who, by God, made it by himself. He planted his own crop, and he harvested the damn thing." In addition to his drive—which is repeated over and over again in stories and anecdotes from people who worked with him and knew him for a long time—the book repeatedly highlights that Jerry possesses a wildcatter mentality; he is full risk-on. In fact, there's another great quote that I found when I was researching him, in which he says, "The only way to break out is to gamble." And I think this is a great description of him. It says that Jones still operates on the oil patch mentality that he picked up during his early business years: "Roll the dice until your knuckles bleed. Never ever do what the traditionalists would do. Wait till he buys the Cowboys." There's so much low-hanging fruit, and it was actually shocking. One of the most surprising things I learned from reading this book is just how uncertain Jerry Jones's investment in the Cowboys was at the time he made it. Now, it's worth probably somewhere between $8 and $10 billion is the rumor if he tried to sell the Cowboys—how much did he go for? So, it says, "Roll the dice until your knuckles bleed. Never ever do what the traditionalists would do." Jones is determined to succeed on his own terms, in his own way. And one of the most important—or maybe even the most influential—people who taught Jones to take risks, to be bold, and to blaze his own path and basically do what he wants to do in life was his father, Pat Jones. Obviously, this is a great example of that maxim that you and I talk about over and over again. In almost every single book, the story of the father is embedded in the son, and I'm going to go into the childhood of Pat Jones and Jerry Jones. But I want to talk about, towards the end of the book, when it was interesting. There's a story in the book where Jerry is worried his father is in poor health—they were worried that he was about to die. And there's this story about what Jerry was like—devastated. So, it says: As Pat Jones clung to life, Jerry Jones leaned over to his father and whispered in his ear, "Fight. Try hard. Don't give up. We all love you so much." With tears in his eyes, he hugged the man he calls the most influential person in his life. And so, as a way for you and me to try to understand the son, we obviously want to study the story of his father. So, he was raised in this tiny town in Arkansas. It actually enjoyed the distinction of having one tavern for every six citizens—so there's a saloon on nearly every street corner. Most of it is a rather poor, lower-class neighborhood, primarily populated by railroad and machine shop workers. The description of Jerry's dad is going to sound a lot like that of Jerry when he was a young man. It says Pat Jones had the energy of a locomotive. He was a born promoter—he was raised in a tiny farming community. The Jones family lived in a leaky, poorly painted shack. So, his dad grew up during the Great Depression, and one of the things that helped him survive that era was that he was a born salesman. He says what he did best was to sell. So even from a young age, he was walking down the streets with buckets of peas and selling them hand-to-mouth. Jerry's dad got married, had kids, and raised his family. They lived in a tiny second-floor apartment above what started out as a fruit stand that his dad began. So, Pat Jones started a fruit stand that eventually evolved into a full-fledged supermarket. But it says that the family of four lived in a small apartment for over seven years above the fruit stand, which eventually turned into the grocery store, nurtured by working day and night. And so, the idea that both Jerry and his dad possess this showmanship—a P.T. Barnum-esque personality—is evident in the way he would say, "Okay, well, how do I get as many people into the store as possible?"

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He does all kinds of things. At night, it turned into a dance hall. And then one of the most successful advertising and marketing promotions he did was setting up a radio show inside his grocery store in rural Arkansas. No one was doing this at the time. The reason I bring this up to you is that there are a lot of ideas that Jerry had when he took over the Dallas Cowboys that seem obvious to us now because everybody does it, but nobody was doing it back then. One of Pat's ideas—his next promotion—was nearly unheard of in 1954: a live on-site radio show that mixed music with heavy endorsements for the products in the stores. I don't know why I found that funny. The guy running the radio store is a man named Brother Hal Weber. He did his hillbilly act from the back of Pat's Supermarket, and the parking lot was jammed. People would drive from the surrounding 15 counties. It's one of the damnedest things I'd ever seen. They came wondering what the heck was going on in the store. This part of his life is so important because of how young Jerry was. Pat's Supermarket was young Jerry Jones's first exposure to hard work and showmanship. And he took to his father's example like a duck to water. I did everything Jerry said. I learned how to do everything in the store. I was up at the crack of dawn, and I'd be working until midnight. My dad was a driver, but he was also a teacher. He just somehow knew where he was going. More than 60 years after the Great Depression, Jerry Jones still feels its influence. It was that mentality from that era that drove my dad. When I was a kid, it was all my dad could talk about. The Depression. It scared the hell out of the people who grew up there, especially the ones on the farms. My dad passed that fear along to me. That is why I always worked when I was a kid. My dad said, "I'm going to teach you to work so that you don't mind working, and it will become part of your personality when you grow up." Goddamn it. If I wasn't down there working at the store every day, I knew my butt was going to be in trouble. And this is what his dad said about Jerry as a kid: I knew that Jerry had the right instincts even when he was a kid; he could talk to people just as if he were an adult. It was a gift. Jerry heard nothing but business talk during breakfast, lunch, and dinner. He understood that he wanted to make money and get ahead. Keep in mind, Jerry was seven years old. They're talking about Jerry when he was seven years old and what he went through. In fact, I had dinner with one of the wealthiest people in the world a few nights ago. And there are two interesting things, especially if you've been analyzing the books I've been reading over the last few weeks: just how recurring the theme was. And the guy I was having dinner with—he's in his 70s—was telling me that his father was the one who originally started the business, and it had drastically expanded under the second and third generations. And he was telling me, "My dad started me and my brother working in the business when we were six." Every holiday from school was spent working in the family business. And so there are two striking things. I mean, the conversation was incredible, the dinner was incredible, but I learned a lot. But two of the most striking things were just how common it was. Again, if you look at Jerry Jones this week, Leon Hess last week, the Wallenbergs, Hetty Green—go back to older examples like Estée Lauder and the Waltons. I even think about Steve Jobs' dad, who, when Steve was five years old, taught him how to take things apart—and the fact that you could make a TV. These aren't magical things like TV, radio, and electronics. Well, guess what? Humans figured out how to make that, and he essentially taught his young son that from an early age. But it's just remarkable to me, and I need to point this out to you because it may be obvious to you, but in case it's not obvious: it wasn't obvious to me before I started reading all these books just how common this is. You know, the amount of valuable education you can instill in your child about business, producing goods and services, working your ass off, and trying to help other people and build wealth through doing that is so valuable. And regardless of industry, all the people I've read about—and the person I was talking to—they all work in different industries, and yet their families did the exact same thing. And then, another interesting thing about the dinner is this encyclopedic knowledge of business history that was in this guy's head. And we talked about a bunch of the books I'd covered in the past. In some cases, he knew the entrepreneur or the family—or whatever the case is—and he filled in a lot; he just knew everything. Again, I think it just speaks to the idea: what can we do if we're trying to build the most powerful families possible? First, we get our kids involved, and we teach them the value of business, entrepreneurship, investing, and working really hard from a young age, and then, obviously, get them reading and studying as much business history as possible because that's just a recurring theme. So there is another thing that Jerry picks up from his dad. And his dad was an extremely hard worker, just like Jerry's going to be. But his dad partied a lot.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so I'm not going to cover it, but there are entire chapters in this book about how much Jerry parties. So I'm just going to give you an anecdote from his childhood where he saw his dad doing this. Early one morning, after failing to make it home the previous night, Pat Jones looked up to find his wife staring coldly into his bloodshot eyes. He happened to be in the company of two young ladies. Next to his mother sat young Jerry. "Jerry, I want you to take a good look at your father." If you're wondering where your father was last night, he was right here with these. You know what, son? I don't want you to grow up this way. So, his father was known as a philanderer. In fact, later on, his dad would run and then sell a very successful insurance company. And there's an anecdote in the book that says his father would hire insurance salespeople based on how well they could seduce women. So again, there are a lot of stories in this book about this drive to work excessively hard. They also applied it to their nightlife, too. Jerry Jones describes his father as the most influential man in his life. At the dinner table, Pat Jones would lecture Jerry almost every night on his business philosophy. He also instilled in him a taste for flamboyant risk-taking and a fearless compulsion to do things his own way. There's just a 20-year age difference between them. His mother points out that they're as much like brothers as they are father and son. They're both. This is still his mom describing both her husband and her son. They're both workaholics. They also happen to love their work. They make it their life. They are just alike. They are almost like twins. So, Jerry's main love in life besides work is football. He started playing football in high school and ended up playing in college. I'm going to skip over most of that because I want to talk about his early oil and gas career and then him buying the Cowboys. But I do want to pull out a couple of interesting lines that I think can tell you an entire story in just a sentence or two. It's the fact that he played football. If you analyze the way he played football, the way he approached it, it's like, "Oh, that's how he works, too." And so there are just these quotes from people on his team. And also, his coaches say he played with reckless intensity. His head coach remembers that Jerry didn't have a whole lot of anything as an athlete, but when he started something, he didn't quit. The kid just worked his ass off, night and day. Another coach said he was the fiercest competitor we had. So he was wheeling and dealing and selling as much as he could while he was in school. When he got out of school, he started working in oil and gas, which I'll get to—how he got there. This was very interesting, though, because I'm reading this entire section—it's about his personality, his salesmanship, and his intense energy. The fact that this guy just goes and goes and goes, with almost no sleep. And for some reason, I get to this sentence after reading this entire chapter, and it made me think of what Ted Turner says: "Jerry has always been a total extrovert. A salesman, a promoter." He always had that tremendous energy level. So back on episode 327, I did the autobiography of Ted Turner. It's one of the most fascinating autobiographies I've ever read. But what I did is, man, why am I having—why does this remind me of Ted Turner so much? So what I did is I went and asked Sage, "Can you describe the personality and traits of Ted Turner?" and it actually created this outline for me. And I'm like, this sounds just like Jerry Jones. This is why this was in my head. So here are some key characteristics. I'm going to read the parts. Almost this entire outline is Jerry Jones. So I'm describing Ted Turner, but it really gives you an overview of who Jerry Jones is, especially when he was young in his career. Number one, boundless energy and intensity. Known for nonstop talking and nervous energy. He cannot sit still and needs constant movement and activity. This sounds like Jerry Jones to me; he worked incredibly long hours, often sleeping in his office. Number two, extraordinary vision and belief. He had absolute conviction in his ideas. This is, again, still about Ted Turner. Wait till we get to the massive bets—these huge, risky bets that Jerry Jones placed in his life. He had absolute conviction. And why would you do that? Because you have absolute conviction in your ideas. In Ted Turner's case, particularly regarding the future of cable TV, he was willing to be early and made bold predictions. He had an obsessive work ethic, living by the motto, "Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell, and advertise." He would consistently be the first to arrive and the last to leave, pushing himself and his organizations relentlessly. Again, still about Ted Turner—the same person we're describing, the same exact personality type. Complex personal background: deeply impacted by childhood experiences and the relationship with his father; developed a fear of abandonment and a need for constant companionship; struggled with personal relationships despite business success.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

At the same time, they were both charismatic leaders with incredibly enthusiastic and infectious personalities. They could be incredibly persuasive one-on-one. Jerry Jones is one of the best salespeople you could ever read about. They were both known for thinking unconventionally and making themselves unforgettable—a strategic risk taker, willing to bet big on their convictions. They often competed against much larger companies and had more commitment and desire than their competitors. And then finally, this extreme level of self-confidence to act on their beliefs: extremely self-assured, not afraid to challenge industry giants, and believing strongly in their ability to succeed. It is remarkable how much of what I remember reading about Ted Turner really jumped out at me as I was going through this biography of Jerry Jones. Now, when we move into his early life and his early career, you see that his relentless drive also produced this frantic energy. He had this deep, burning desire to get rich, and he wanted to get rich and go into football. He talked about this a decade and a half before he had the money to buy the Cowboys, but it was so overwhelming—all the different businesses that he tried, and in many cases failed at, before he wound up making a ton of money in oil and gas. So it says: For more than 15 years, Jones moved like a human meteor. Since leaving the University of Arkansas, he had helped his father turn his new business, which was a moderate-sized insurance company, into a booming success. He had also invested in real estate, pizza, and chicken. He wound up getting married and also having three children at the exact same time. He borrowed $50,000. This guy was going to be up to his eyeballs in debt. He borrowed $50,000 from John Ed Chambers, his father-in-law, who owned a small bank in Arkansas. What did he do with the money? Jones had the chance to invest in both McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises. Instead, he decided to buy the Missouri rights to a pizza chain called Shakey's. The problem is, this pizza chain went out of business. Now he's got a bunch of misses, but he also had a few solid early investments—one of those being in his friend Don Tyson's Chicken Company. But for most of the 1960s, young Jerry Jones was trying all these things and failing at many. He says, "There were so many times when I was down on one knee. One of the hardest things I learned was keeping my head together during those tough times. You just have to buck up and move on to the next decision. If you don't approach the next deal with enthusiasm, you lose." So he was in his mid-20s and vastly overextended. He was borrowing as much money as he could, and he was also buying and trying to invest in real estate. He was almost broke because the banks were almost calling in the loans. So it says: By the late 1960s, Jones's financial problems had become so complex and so intense that his hands would shake and he would cry. The strain of all the debt he was under was overwhelming. His biggest financial burden was a $500,000 investment he had made in some land. He planned to eventually build a Walmart on the property—so sell to Sam Walton. It sounds like this: Friends advised Jones to sell off the land, but he paid $500,000 for this plot of land. Jones stubbornly stuck with this investment. Because of an array of failed investments, banks started calling in his loans. One of the hardest things you'll ever have to do is sit across from a banker who's calling in a $50,000 loan, then turn around and ask him for another $50,000. So he owns a bunch of land. He also owns a bunch of rental properties. Jones says one afternoon he went to visit an elderly lady who lived in one of his rental houses. She was more than three months behind on payments. When she told Jones that she didn't have the money to make a payment, he turned and walked away. As he drove off, he began to cry. The banker who had made the half-million-dollar real estate loan learned of Jones's generosity to the old lady and persuaded the bank to give Jones an extension on his payments. Now here's the crazy part. There's a benefit. So, being a little nutty or a little crazy—the best way to think about this was put by Charlie Munger, who says, "Never underestimate the man who overestimates himself." I'm going to read the full quote from Charlie Munger because I think he picked up on something very unusual. So Charlie says, "While an excess of self-regard is often counterproductive in its effect on cognition, it can cause some weird successes from overconfidence that happen to lead to success. Never underestimate the man who overestimates himself." And so, in his 20s, Jones didn't have much of a track record of success, and yet he's just so damn stubborn. It's like, "I'm not selling anything; I'm going to go down fighting." Okay, so they're like, "Sell this piece of land, you nut job. Right? It's $500,000. What are you doing?" And he's just saying no because he has this relentless drive and self-belief.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And he ends up being right. This is like the whole story. I almost accidentally stumbled upon that idea from Munger when I was rereading the highlights for this book. It's like, "Never underestimate the man who overestimates himself." Thirty years later, Jones still owns that piece of property, which has long been paid off. There's a Walmart on that property, and then after that, they developed a new interstate highway. So this piece of land that he bought—on which they built a Walmart—became more valuable. Then here comes the highway. That land is now valued at $20 million. He refused to sell the $500,000 piece of land. 20 or 30 years later, it’s $20 million. And there's so many examples, and really that is the theme of this conversation, this podcast is all about these things that Jones did that shouldn't have worked out, but they did work out. Like, even when you get to the Cowboys—when you see the financial performance of the Cowboys before he bought them—it was just unbelievable that he turned this around and it turned out the way it did. So, in one night, he catches a break here. So remember, the 1960s had just been absolute hell for this guy. You know, he's crying, he's up to his eyeballs in debt. He's having meetings with banks, and he's like, "Give us your money." He's like, "Not only am I not going to give you your money, I want you to give me more money." It's just a completely crazy story. So, in 1970, his father sells the insurance company Modern Security Life that I was telling you about—the one that Jerry helped his dad build. As a result, from what I've read, Jerry nets about $500,000 from that sale. Then he's like, "All right, I'm going to move my young family to Little Rock, Arkansas, and I'm going to get into the oil business." So, Jones puts out the word that he was ready to enter the oil business. A relative introduces him to an Oklahoma oil man named Bill Sparks. Again, let's go back to: never underestimate the man who overestimates himself. While an excess of self-regard is often counterproductive in its effects on cognition, it can sometimes cause some weird successes due to overconfidence that happens to cause success. So, he's introduced—he's like, "Hey, I'm moving my family; I'm going to get into the oil business"—and he's introduced to this guy who is pitching an oil deal that everybody is saying, "You're crazy." The one person who doesn't tell him no is going to be Jerry Jones. This is insane. So, Sparks wants to come out on his own. He's working for a company, and he's like, "Listen, I think I found this essentially meandering underground river of oil, and I'm almost positive that if we drill here and can map this out, we're going to find a river of oil 7,000 ft below the ground—in the P.—and it's called the Red Fork Sand." No one believed him. The company he was working for thought he was so crazy that they fired him. They're like, "This is the stupidest idea we've ever heard. You're fired." So, Bill Sparks is shopping the deal again. The funny thing about this is that this is a deal that everybody said no to. Wait till you see the financial performance of this deal. And so, one of Jerry's partners in oil and gas is describing Jerry for us. Probably one of Jerry's worst traits is his inability to say no to risky ventures. He does love high-risk, high-return ventures. So, he loved this Bill Sparks idea. Bill managed to sell the idea to Jerry when he couldn't sell it to anybody else. Remember that? The same exact thing is going to happen when he buys the Cowboys. I think the owner of the Cowboys, if I remember correctly, shopped the Cowboys to like 75 other people before he did it to Jones. It's crazy. And then you talk about this frantic energy—this did, like, this: he just... he's involved in so many things. So, when Jerry gets pitched this idea from Bill Sparks, what is Jerry doing? And this is why I love it. It was kind of humorous and funny to read the book because you're reading about all these ventures, like investing in pizza, chicken, and real estate. And so now he's getting pitched the deal. And what was Jerry doing when he got pitched this deal? He was selling mobile homes. Like, what is going on here? So, it says Jones and his partner, Jim Dooley, were selling mobile homes when they got word of Sparks's scheme. So, Jones decides. Jones and Dooley team up with Sparks and this other guy named Ran Ricks—they have the funniest names in this book, by the way. Ran Ricks. Wait till we get to the owner of the Cowboys' name—that's who Jerry buys it from. So, you have Jim Dooley, Jerry Jones, Bill Sparks, and Ran Ricks. And so I was trying to figure out—I was like, "Where the hell do you get the money from?" This is why it was so important for the sale of his father's insurance company. Okay. So, Jones's faith—he's like, "Okay, I'm gonna buy into your idea"—his faith in Bill Sparks paid off. The group hit their first well. So, keep in mind, this is the deal that Bill Sparks shopped to everybody—everybody said, "This is not gonna work." His previous company said, "This is stupid. We're going to fire you." The first time they drilled that well was worth more than $4 million.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So, what does that mean? Hitting that first well meant that they could go to the bank, borrow money, and keep drilling. It meant everything in the world to us. The group hit their next well, and the next one, and the next. In all, they hit oil in the first 15 wells that they drilled. This is what Bill Sparks said about this: "Right off the bat, Jerry believed in me." Why? I don't completely know, other than the fact that he was hungry to get rich. But there was another thing— all he could talk about was that he wanted to make enough money to buy a football team. After the first successful well came in, the partying began. So, this is what I mean about these guys: they work excessively hard and party hard. So, what do I mean by partying hard? You know, they're starting to get rich. When the first successful well comes in, how do they celebrate? They rent out an entire hotel. So, they rent every single room in the hotel—they're in Oklahoma City at the time. They invite over 500 people and say they will rent out every room in the hotel, and the party will go all night. Just about everybody got drunk, got naked, and jumped in the pool. And so then Jones doesn't stop there. His excessive drive, his excessive self-confidence is like, "Hey, I drilled oil successfully. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to drill for natural gas." So, he winds up partnering with this guy named Mike McCoy. He walks into Mike McCoy's office in 1980. He was coming off one of the greatest financial and emotional highs of his life. Jones had sold one of his oil production companies in 1976 and walked away from the Red Fork Sand deal with Bill Sparks with a profit of more than $50 million. This is another one of his partners. You see, everybody who runs into Jerry Jones—he's remarkably consistent. The way his partners and his coworkers all describe him is essentially that he doesn't change. Jerry has never met a high-risk deal that he didn't like. He's a risk taker, and the riskier, the better. You have to be a gambler to play in this business. If you get disappointed over failure, you shouldn't be in this business. At the same time, if you get too high over success, you will bust yourself. The excitement in the oil and gas business is unmatched by any other business. There's a great line when you watch Landman. I think the best single line in that entire series is when the billionaire oil founder—one of the main characters in the show—says, "Our business is a constant state of crisis interrupted by periods of immense success." So, Jones goes to Mike McCoy and he's like, "Okay, let's get into the gas drilling business." He's like, "Let's drill for natural gas." This is what Jones was referencing earlier at the very beginning when he said, "I'm going to drill for gas out in San Francisco when my daughter is at Stanford." So they're like, "Okay, we're going to take a shot at two wells. We're going to drill for natural gas near San Francisco and then in southeastern Oklahoma at the same time." Almost immediately, the project met with disaster. The first one they did was in Oklahoma—almost immediately, the project met with disaster when an employee made a half-million-dollar mistake. After drilling the customary 8-inch-diameter hole, he tried to pour cement into the casing to add support to the well; instead, he mistakenly dumped cement into the well itself, ruining it. Jones took the bad news in stride. Remember what their description of the oil and gas business is: if you get disappointed over failure, you should not be in this business. You made a mistake—that's fine; you get up and you drill again. This is exactly what they did. The partners invested another $500,000. They moved the drill bit 100 ft. The next day, they learned they had hit a natural gas well worth over $40 million. At the same time, they're drilling in San Francisco. The first reports from the well near San Francisco were not good. The guy running the job for them out there called and said, "We had turned up nothing." Then he called back eight hours later and said, "We're going to be rich. The well outside of San Francisco will produce $40 million worth of gas over a two-year period." Jones and McCoy had made $80 million on their first two natural gas wells. The crazy stories in this book continue. This is one of the biggest—I think this might be the biggest deal he does. This next story is the biggest deal he does before he buys the Dallas Cowboys. It is also the hardest to explain and the one that he has the most controversy over. So Jerry has a friend, this guy named Sheffield Nelson. Sheffield Nelson was CEO of Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co., which is a state-regulated utility company. Before Nelson was CEO of this utility company, he and Jones had been friends for almost a decade. They owned a bunch of businesses together. So they owned a television station, a racehorse, a farm, and a condominium. And so, in January 1981, Jones forms a new gas drilling company. He's going to call it Arkoma Production.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Jones is then going to do a deal again with a state-regulated utility—which people call one of the greatest sweetheart deals of all time. The agreement that he signs with the company that his friend is owner of allows Jones to sell gas to Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company, which is also known as ARKLA, at a price that was far higher than what the utility was paying others in the field. So he managed to sign an agreement with them where they would pay him $4.50 per thousand cubic feet, more than nine times what the previous producers had been receiving from the same company. And in a few years, this deal gets even wilder because, in 1985, the natural gas industry was deregulated, and so the price of gas drops dramatically. Unfortunately, under the terms of their agreement, the utility company was committed—they had to buy as much gas as Jones could produce at the maximum legal price. So what does he do at this point? He goes, and he and his partner—this is the same guy, Mike McCoy—go and make deals with other gas producers to turn their leases over to Arkoma Production, because Arkoma Production has a guaranteed contract where they can sell it for a higher price than if you were drilling the gas yourself. McCoy and Jones pointed out to landowners and potential leasers that they could receive a much higher return on their gas by working out deals with Arkoma instead of continuing their low‑paying contracts with Arkansas Louisiana themselves. And this is the end result: Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company was paying Arkoma Production $40 million a year for gas that it didn't need. And so, if you sign a bad deal, one way to get out of that deal is to actually buy the company—to buy out the company. So then Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company announces that it's actually buying Arkoma Production. Arkoma Production was started from scratch in 1981. In 1987, Jones and his partner sell it for $175 million, which means that if you calculate how much money they took out of the business plus the sales price, Arkoma Production had walked away with more than $300 million. Now this again goes back to: never underestimate the man who overestimates himself. There's another wildcatter—I think it was Monty Moncrief, or maybe Sid Richardson—who said, "I'd rather be lucky than smart." Well, here's an example here: they walk away with $300 million. Jones and McCoy had drilled more than 200 wells and they had come up empty on exactly one. So Jones is going to get to the end of the '80s; he's around 47 years old when he's going to buy the Dallas Cowboys. After all of these adventures in oil and gas, he winds up having about $90 million in cash. Now he has enough money and the opportunity to do what he's been wanting to do. So if you go back throughout the book—for over 20 years, as early as the 1960s, all throughout the time he was in the oil fields in the 1970s—Jones would tell anybody who would listen that someday he'd buy a football team. As early as 1982, he started sharing his blueprint with his old college roommate. His college roommate is Jimmy Johnson. This is a guy that, when Jones buys the Dallas Cowboys, he fires their long‑term coach, Tom Landry, and immediately hires Jimmy Johnson. And what he told him in 1982 is, "Hey, you keep doing what you do best, which is coaching, and I'll keep doing what I do best, which is making money. And one of these days, we'll do this together in the NFL." So the owner of the Cowboys at this time was this guy named Bum Bright. HR Bum Bright—I love these names—and he is going to be forced to sell the team. There's actually a history of the owners of the Dallas Cowboys being forced to sell the team because they had a severe cash crisis. So Bum Bright had made a bunch of money in trucking, oil, real estate, and banking. He was making a ton of money in the early '80s. By 1989, his financial empire was crumbling. His bank was in utter disarray because it was suffering these catastrophic real estate losses. In fact, at the time he's selling the Dallas Cowboys, his bank was being run by federal regulators. Now, Bright is motivated to sell for the same reason that forced the original Cowboys owner—this guy named Clint Murchison Jr.—who sold Bright the team in 1984; he was in a financial free‑fall and the ground was coming up fast. Now here's a really interesting thing: essentially, Murchison hand‑picked Bright to sell the team to. And Bright did not; he didn't love football. In fact, before he owned the team, he'd only ever gone to, like, two Cowboys games in his life. And the reason he was persuaded to buy the team was, he's like, "Oh, there's enough depreciation in the team that it can be used as a tax write‑off for, at the time, my booming oil business." So I need to go back to this idea that over and over again we see Jerry making an investment that other people—they're just not sure bets at the time. And in many cases, people were offered the same deal and a ton of people said no.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So buying the Cowboys was not a sure bet. The difference was that, unlike Bum Bright, Jerry was obsessed with football. He's actually obsessed. And I want to read this quote from Graham Duncan about the importance of being obsessed in a second. So Jerry's gonna buy the team for $140 million. What is he buying? He's buying a football team that, in 1988—the last year before he was a principal owner—lost $9 million; a team in an organization that was incapable of selling the majority of the luxury suites. I think, like, over 90% of the luxury suites were unsold—they were sitting empty. Attendance had dropped by almost 25%, and only one home game the entire year had sold out. Bum Bright starts shopping the team 'cause he's in dire financial distress, right? He tried to sell for $180 million. He pitched 75 people before he got to Jerry Jones, and they said no. And so we see this immense appetite for taking risks again from Jerry Jones because what he does is he has $90 million in cash; he empties his entire bank account, then he borrows the remaining balance at steep interest rates. Financial advisors at the time warned that buying the Cowboys was, quote, "ridiculously overpriced and financial suicide." Jerry Jones' risk tolerance in the 1980s and 1990s kind of reminds me of what Elon did after he sold PayPal when he cleared, I think, $180 million after taxes, and he put $100 million into SpaceX, $70 million into Tesla, and $10 million into SolarCity. And I think one of the advantages that Jerry has here—and one of the reasons he's going to do this phenomenal turnaround—is that he's completely obsessed. He's completely obsessed with football, doing deals, selling, and just winning. So this is a great excerpt from the Tim Ferriss podcast where he interviews this guy named Graham Duncan that I always keep on my phone and listen to and read over and over again. And this is a direct quote from Graham talking to Tim. He says, "One question I like to ask people is, if you're hiring an analyst, what criteria are you looking for in the analyst?" So he's talking about money managers, and people who've been managing money and managing people begin to look for things in their analysts that make those analysts most valuable to them. And this guy said, "What I'm looking for is a trace of fear in myself. Okay, I'm trying to hire somebody who makes me almost scared. Why? What I'm looking for is a trace of fear in myself—that this guy is coming for me, that he will replace me." And I think what he's capturing is the level of intensity—this obsessive intensity—that you see in a minority in any field because they've found the game they want to play, and they bring an intensity and an obsessiveness to it that, over time, results in them working so much harder. It's like Wayne Gretzky discovering hockey at age 5. He's obsessed, and he's just going over and over and over again. And there are people in the finance industry who are like that. They are just obsessed with investing in this really distinctive way. Warren Buffett, from a young age, was obsessed. It is obvious. People say, "Oh, there's all these people criticizing Jerry Jones in the book. He's just doing this for money. He wants to make a lot of money." But you can clearly tell he's not doing this for money because 30 years after this book was published, he still owns the Dallas Cowboys. He's obsessed with owning and running a football team. And you just clearly see this. And, as a result of this obsession, he's going to work so much harder at this than the previous owner did, who wasn't really interested in football. He's like, "Oh, this is great. This is a way I can offset some taxes for my oil business." Whereas Jerry's like, "No, I'm going to build the best football— not only a football organization that's trying to win on the field, but also a football company." And he really invents a lot of ideas that are used throughout sports that, to you and me, looking back 30 years later, make you wonder why they weren't doing this back then—it just seems so obvious. So again, just one of his superpowers: Jerry can sell, sell, sell. He had been selling since he was a nine-year-old greeting customers at his family's supermarket. In college, he sold shoes from the trunk of his car. He would make up to $700 selling student tickets before his college football games. So he buys a team and, just like we said that he has in common with Ted Turner, it's like, "I'm going to blaze my own path. I'm going to run the business not how it used to be run—how you think I should run it—but how I want to run it." He immediately takes over the team and then replaces the entire staff. There's a bunch of detail in the book, but I think this one sentence gives you an idea of what he does: it says he took a wrecking ball to the past. And so we immediately see these recurring personality traits—the way he wants to run his business. He's going to be obsessed with speed. He likes to take risks in bunches. He's really just intense and rather a little crazy. He's obsessed with speed, with making decisions and acting on them as quickly as possible. He learned to take risks in bunches in the Oklahoma oil fields. He describes his reasoning for taking risks in bunches: some of your risks are bound to be busts—the more risks you take, the better the chance that one of them will hit. Don Tyson, who built the Tyson poultry empire and who has already been referenced a few times here, talked about his friend again during this time. I know a lot of intense people, but there is nobody as intense as Jerry Jones.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Jerry is a little crazy. He can change moods without blinking. He's got two personalities: on one side, the P.T. Barnum—the raconteur, the storyteller—and on the other, the tough businessman from Arkansas. He can immediately switch from very charming to a very tough man. Very few people know how to read him. His complexities as an individual can be disarming. He approaches any project believing that he can beat any man at anything. It goes back to the Charlie Munger adage: "Never underestimate the man who overestimates himself." This is how somebody who's done several interviews with Jerry describes him. Life is not about smelling the roses. With Jerry, life is hard work. He just doesn't have any time for things like philosophy or poetry. You get the feeling that he will break your balls if you cross him. You have to be on guard with him at all times. And so when you actually analyze what he did when he took over the team, it's just this reminder—I think it's important. It's like most businesses are actually poorly run—even businesses you would think, like an NFL team in 1989. You know, this wasn't like in the '60s. The NFL is not nearly as big as it is today, but it was still a big business—a business that sold for $140 million in 1989, and yet it was just run very shittily. There's no other way to put it: it's crazy that somebody would run that business and allow it to lose, you know, $9 million a year before he takes it over. So what does he do? He just asks himself, "What is the potential for generating revenue?" And Jones has a very simple way of operating. He's like, "What did the previous owner do wrong, and why were they losing so much money?" And then you ask yourself, "What's the highest-impact thing I can do if I need to generate money? I just bought this business, I emptied my bank account. I'm, you know, $60 million in debt just on high interest rates. This thing has to make money right away. What are you going to do?" And the idea was just, "Well, you have all these luxury suites." The luxury suites sell for between $400,000 and $1.5 million apiece. And he also read the NFL rule book, and he realized that selling a suite also offers an additional bonus: according to NFL rules, revenues from the boxes are not shared with other NFL owners the way ticket revenues are. So he's like, "Okay, what did the previous owner do?" They had 188 luxury suites. Do you know how many the previous owner sold? Six. So he spends all his time saying, "I'll make up the huge difference here if I'm able to sell the suites, okay?" So now, within a few years—he buys a team in 1989 (the book is written in 1985)—six years later, the suites are 95 to 98% occupied. Profits from those suites alone, over the few years since Jones bought the team, amount to $50 million just from that one product. Then he looks and he's like, "Hey, we have one of the best locations in town. The entire building is on the 50-yard line. It's the press box. Why the hell are we giving it away?" We give these seats away for free to writers for the local Dallas and Fort Worth newspapers. And so he's like, "What's the difference? They could just move them over to, like, the 5-yard line or something like that. They could still see the game and still write about it." And so then he moves again. This is just very common sense. Most businesses are poorly run if you just sit there and think about it. And obviously it helps that he's obsessed. It's like, yeah, I'm not going to give you the best seat in the house for free. You know how valuable the seats are. You're going to be moved over to the five‐yard line, and I'm going to sell the press box that's on the 50‐yard line—the literally best seat in the house. Then he identifies more opportunities hiding in plain sight. There were no ads inside Texas Stadium at the time. So he's like, "Okay, I did something that had never been done before." This is what I mean about really low‐hanging fruit: opportunity hiding in plain sight. He's like, "We're going to put ads inside the stadium." So when you're watching the game, you also see the ads. And he asked himself, "Who's likely to buy the ads?" Well, probably beer companies, car companies, local car dealers, local banks, local supermarket chains sell a ton of ads. At the time, they were not allowed to sell beer and alcohol. He's like, "Well, that's a problem. I needed." People like to drink beer while they're watching football. So he goes to Irving County City Council—where the stadium is, and they're the ones that have to grant a stadium license to sell beer and wine. So he realizes, "Okay, high‐leverage use of my time and activity: I'm going to convince the city council members to give me the ability to sell beer and wine," which he winds up making—like, $1.5 million per game, $2 million per game in alcohol sales and profit—just by doing this. So he wines and dines them, gives them free seats in the luxury suites, and brings them into the locker room after games. And very shortly after, it says Jones won his vote at the next City Council meeting. Millions and millions of dollars were now rolling in from previously untapped resources. He's maximizing his revenue sources at the exact same time he develops a reputation as a ruthless cost‐cutter.

Any positions that are not generating revenue, he winds up cutting. He began hiring sales and promotions people while weeding out non‐revenue‐producing jobs. You won't find many people around here, with the exceptions of scout coaches and secretaries who are not making money. For Jerry Jones, he wanted no fat; he wanted this lean cash‐flow machine. If you go back—I told you this before—but one of my all‐time favorite biographies I've read is about the early days of Microsoft. It's called Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire. If I remember correctly, one of the things that jumped out—and I've never forgotten since I first read that book a few years ago—was the fact that the first Bill Gates ran Microsoft like this. In the early days, the first 30 employees of Microsoft were 28 programmers, Bill Gates, and a secretary. And Bill was doing all the sales. And something that jumps out as you read the book is like, a lot of the ideas that Jerry Jones applied to this business. It's just like the difference between, like, do you give a damn about what you're doing or not? And if you give a damn, you're just going to pay attention. You're going to pay attention to these little obvious mistakes that previous management—or maybe other competitors—were making. It's like, "I don't—I can just do it a better way." And I trust my own judgment that I'm able to do that. Another thing is that he doesn't shy away from the fact that he is ruthless. The good thing about being an entrepreneur is, like, building your business. You get to literally make your own world within the world. And if you know yourself—which I think Jerry Jones definitely does—you understand that you want to be number one; you want to be in charge. And so there are a lot of people, if you're going to have a long‐term partnership with Jerry (whether it's in oil and gas or in football), you have to be comfortable being number two. And if you're not, and you kind of cross that line, Jerry can be ruthless. He and Jimmy Johnson, rather, were college roommates. They were friends for a long time. He fires him because Jimmy Johnson had a hard time sharing the spotlight with Jerry Jones. You know, Jerry's the owner. He's the one that calls the shots. He winds up firing his friend and his coach after Jimmy Johnson won the second Super Bowl. And he winds up hiring another one of his friends—this guy named Barry Switzer—who lasts a little bit longer, but he was more comfortable playing a number‐two role. Now, there's a bunch of things in the book describing the people in Jerry Jones's life, and they give little, small biographies of them. I've skipped over most of them because I want to focus on Jerry Jones. This just shocked me so much; I had to share it with you. And it's just a reminder that one of the benefits of reading biographies is the ability to step outside yourself and realize that we all have shit to deal with. We all have problems to deal with, but it helps to also be thankful that there's always somebody who has it worse than you do. So I'm reading about Barry Switzer and his parents, and what he had to live through was nuts. So his dad was a bootlegger who sold drugs and alcohol. He was a gambler. He loved to chase women. He would go around with a gun—a .38 revolver—and just shoot it in the air and shoot it in the house. And listen to how Barry Switzer's parents died. So Barry Switzer's father, Frank Switzer, suffered a violent death. He was shot by a jealous girlfriend who, feeling immediately remorseful for shooting him, helped him into the backseat of her car and drove off in a rush toward the hospital. She was speeding down a gravel road. She drove the car, lost control, drove it into a bridge, and the car exploded, and both died in the fire. A few years later, his mom—who was also a drug addict (she was addicted to alcohol and prescription medication)—had a very strained relationship with her son. During a fight, she tries to kiss her son on the cheek, but he turns away. She then leaves, goes to the closet, finds a pistol, walks out to the back porch, and shoots herself in the head. And so, Jerry Jones's long‐term partners—the people who have worked with him for a long time—talk about, like, if you want to work with him, it's very easy to interface. One of his partners says, "First of all, you must have a desire to succeed, and you must also have a willingness not to be number one." Then the book ends by describing the impact that Jerry Jones had on that organization. The Cowboys' financial ledger portrays one of the greatest turnaround stories in all of sports. The team lost $9 million in 1988, the year before Jones bought the team. The Cowboys have averaged more than $30 million in profits per year over the last three years. And then I read they're doing over a billion dollars in revenue a year now. And that is where I'll leave it for the full story. I really recommend reading the book. This book is full of wild stories.

A sensation was caused by an unknown designer named Christian Dior. He was producing long, full dresses using prodigious quantities of precious materials and thumbing his nose at wartime austerity. His new collection electrified rich, fashion-conscious ladies in all nations. But who is Christian Dior and where did he come from? His father was a successful businessman who ran a fertilizer factory specializing in liquid manure, the foundation of the Dior Empire was s_*_, in the literal sense. 50 years from now, Dior would be the beginning of Bernard Arnault's LVMH Empire, which I talked about on episode 296, if you haven't listened to the episode already. It's one of my favorite episodes I've ever made. The profits of liquid manure allow the Dior family to maintain a house in Paris, and a young Christian Dior took full advantage of it. He would love to draw, love dressing up with the help of his enduring mother, and he enjoyed designing dresses for his sisters. He's a kid when he's doing this. So it's another example of something you and I talk about all the time, that true interest is revealed early. But he did not start out working in the fashion business. One of his first jobs, he actually became a partner in an art business. His father putting up the money on behalf of the son. This is the pre-history of Dior's fashion business. Then troubles came. His brother was locked up in insane asylum, his mother died, and then in 1931 during the Great Depression, his father went bankrupt. Virtually all of the art galleries, including Dior's, failed. Without this financial disaster, Dior would probably have spent his life as a middle-ranking art dealer and died unknown. That's another example of one of my favorite ideas that comes up in these biographies over and over again, that opportunity is a strange beast. It frequently appears after a loss. At this time, this is the best thing. Him failing as an art dealer is one of the -- is the best thing that ever happened to him. He just didn't -- certainly didn't feel so at the time. And so after this, Christian Dior actually gets a job working for the designer Lucien Lelong and he actually spends about 10 years working for him before he gets his break, and they describe this as hovering on the fringes of the fashion industry. Then came a unique stroke of fortune that transformed his life, something that would allow a frustrated would-be creator to fulfill his destiny. Dior certainly believed in luck, and that is even an understatement. Christian Dior believed in fortune tellers. He believed what they told him when they forecast his destiny to be true. A wise woman, as he called them, that is a fortune teller, had told him that women will be very lucky for you. You will earn much money from them and travel widely. As of July 1946, however, this is one of the craziest sentences when you think about the life of Christian Dior. As of July 1946, however, Dior was a nobody in his 40s with nothing in his designed career to suggest genius. Then that month, he met Marcel Boussac. So I'm going to pause right there. One of my favorite paragraphs I've ever read and anything I've read for the podcast so for came from this excellent essay by Paul Graham. I covered it all the way back on episode 314. The essay is called How to Do Great Work. This is what Paul Graham noticed because he's read a bunch of biographies, and I noticed the same as I read a bunch biographies. When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it is remarkable how much luck is involved.

They discover what to work on as a result of chance meeting, or by reading a book, they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck. And the way to do that is to be curious. Christian Dior is going to meet Marcel Boussac because of the relationships that he developed in the previous decade working in the Paris fashion industry. So it says that month he met Marcel Boussac, a textile magnet, who was called King Cotton. Boussac wanted to own a big Paris fashion house to give prestige to his booming but humdrum business. Someone told him that Dior might be able to produce ideas, hence, their meeting. So they went to a meeting, and this is Dior did something that was genius. And then as you understand his personality, so far outside of his normal personality. He was -- when you read his autobiography, most of the people you and I talk about, they have a lot of self-confidence. Christian Dior is the opposite. He is constantly plagued by imposter syndromes and doubt and uncertainty. And so looking back at his life, the fact that he said this to Boussac, what I'm about to read you, is a miracle. So Christian Dior takes a tour of Boussac's factories like I don't want to run this at all. And so he says, I'm not interested in managing a clothing factory. What you need and what I would like to run is a craftsman workshop in which we would recruit the very best people in the trade to reestablish in Paris, a salon for the greatest luxury and the highest standards of workmanship. It will cost a great deal of money and entail much risk. Boussac liked the idea and offered to set up Dior with an investment of CHF 10 million. This was later increased to CHF 100 million for the investment that Boussac is going to make in Christian Dior and then he's going to pay off handsomely. At the last minute, this is what I meant about him constantly struggling with imposter syndrome. He had never started a business before. His first experiment as an entrepreneur is going to be the Christian Dior brand that still exists to this day.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Yet to both of them, their creations are alive. My poor dresses, my poor dresses, what a fate is there. As the right to buy my dresses includes that of examining the dress thoroughly. They're measured. They're turned inside out. They're unstitched. Sometimes, literally pulled to pieces. This is how he describes what's happening. During this slaughter, I prefer not to enter the salon in order to spare myself the spectacle, which would upset me almost as much as it upsets the dresses. Clearly, the words of somebody that cares deeply about what they're doing. Marc Andreessen has one of the greatest quotes I've ever heard about the emotional state of being an entrepreneur. He says, the entrepreneur only ever experiences two states, that of euphoria and terror, the highest highs and the lowest lows, and usually, they can occur in the same day or one right after another. So Christian Dior is now launching another collection, which, to some degree, is a finish line or a temporary break. And this is how he describes it. I remain alone and ask myself over and over again. Have I imported enough novelty? Is this novelty wearable? Are the models sufficiently striking? In fact, I am no longer capable of judging. The most exacting jury in the world is assembling to conduct my trial. He's talking about the market. The game has now passed out of my hands. I am in a perpetual state of tension. I want to shout out, it's done, it's finished, it's over at last. At the same time, I realize that tomorrow, I shall feel an intolerable void. My life, in fact, revolves around the preparation of a collection with its torments and happiness, with its euphoria and terror is another way to say that. I know that in spite of all the delights of a vacation, it will seem an intolerable gap. My thoughts stay with my dresses. It is now that I like to sit down in front of my dresses, gaze at them a last time altogether and thank them from the bottom of my heart, and that is where I'll leave it.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

At the last minute, Dior was frightened and almost turned down the offer, but he was persuaded into it by his fortune teller. Dior doubled the risk of opening a new fashion house with his revolutionary new look, a deliberate and defined return to the most extravagant use of material. He spat in the face of post-war egalitarian democracy and said, I want to make the rich feel rich again. His first collection turned out to be the most successful in fashion history. Christian Dior recruited and continued to employ the best people to be found in France, men and women who would rather die than turn out a piece of clothing, which was in the tiniest degree below the best in the world. When I first read this, the note that I left myself was, this is the Pixar of fashion houses when Steve Jobs, he said, the first 400 employees at Pixar was the only company he ever came across in his entire life that was an entire company of A-players. When he went back to Apple in '97, I think he said they had around 3,000 employees. And he's like, of course, you can't have a collection of 3,000 A-players. But Pixar proved to Steve Jobs it was possible to have 400 A-players inside of one company. The success of the fashion house was immediate and prolonged, and the volume of business continued to grow steadily in the 10 years up to Dior's death in 1957 by which time the House of Dior employed 1,000 of the finest experts ever gathered together under one roof. During this decade, Dior sold over 100,000 dresses made from 16,000 design sketches and using 1,000 miles of fabric.

Okay. So that was an excerpt not from the book I'm going to talk to you about today. That was actually this book called Creators. It is written by one of my favorite authors, this guy named Paul Johnson. It is like a 15 -- I think it has 15 chapters on some of history's greatest creators, so people like Picasso, Walt Disney, Balenciaga, Christian Dior, Shakespeare, Mark Twain. It is an excellent little book. I highly recommend you pick up a copy for yourself. But the reason I wanted to start there is because I had previously attempted to read Christian Dior's autobiography, which came out almost 80 years ago. And Dior is very much an eclectic, a very -- he's an odd duck. The way I described this book before was that Christian Dior writes like Willy Wonka speaks. Even the structure of the book is bizarre. He puts his -- the last chapter is on his childhood, like his early life. But reading Paul Johnson's overview of the life and career of Christian Dior inspired me to pick up his autobiography and reread it. A Man Full of Self-Doubt And I'm glad I did because Christian Dior is maybe one of the most unique people. He just stands out. If you think about like you and I study uncommon people and even Christian Dior is uncommon amongst uncommon people because how many people do we study that had no entrepreneurial leanings at all that other people would describe by the time they're in their 40s, that they had -- they were nobodies and they had nothing to suggest any kind of genius. There's a lot of people that become successful and achieve their greatest work later in life. But you'll hear from people when they were younger, that they showed signs of talent or obsessiveness or drive that was unusual compared to the people around them. No one describes Christian Dior like that. He doesn't even describe himself like that. So I want to go through his autobiography and I want to see if you and I together can figure out the mystery that is Christian Dior. I have to start with something that was very fascinating because, again, like I'm pretty sure you don't believe in fortunetellers just like I don't believe in fortune tellers. But the important thing is that Dior believed in them. And that sometimes it's helpful to have something outside of yourself that pushes you even though you're filled with doubt. Dior was rife with insecurities and uncertainties. Certainly before he was successful, but even after he was successful, and he does credit the multiple visits to his fortune tellers with helping him move forward in times of doubt. And this is so important to him that the very first chapter, the very first chapter, very first paragraph, this is what he says, I must acknowledge my debt to the fortune tellers who have predicted it.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And there are several examples in the book where he quotes what they tell them. This is way before he had any success, and this is what one of them said, you will suffer poverty, but women are lucky for you. And through them, you will achieve success. You will make a great deal of money out of them, and you will travel widely. Do you want to know when that happened to him? That happened to him in 1919. He was 14. He was 14 years old when she's reading his palm and she gave him that prediction for his future success. And so it's obvious from a young age that he was rife with insecurities and doubts about himself and his talent. He was also, as he ages and he goes to his career, he's also pack full of hypocrisies, and you'll see this because he says, listen, I had spent 10 happy years as a designer at Lucien Lelong and it was a delightful existence. Why? Because he just had a job. He did not want to be an entrepreneur. He did not want the stress that comes from leading your own fashion house. He says, I had none of the responsibilities of putting my designs into practice, nor the burden of an executive job. But yet 10 years in, he's like, well, maybe I'm just making another man rich. The good -- the interesting thing about the Paris fashion industry at this point in history is like a lot of the other -- there's this idea of seniors that the -- like the highest quality people tend to cluster together in very important times. So if you are a young, mechanically inclined, talented person interested in automobiles industry in 1900, you're living in Detroit. If you love making hand-built cars to race in the 1940s and '50s, you're living in Italy. If you're interested in computers and softwares in the last 50 years, you're probably in Silicon Valley. In this part, if you're interested in fashion and you're alive in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, you are in Paris. And so he sees other people working inside of his same company leaving. So one of these guys -- I'm not a fashion person, so I can't never pronounce any of these names, but a lot of these brands are still around. Obviously, Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, but there's a guy named Pierre Balmain. And so he leaves, and he decides to start a new house under his own name. This company is still -- it's 78 years old, and it's still in existence to this day. And so this is why I'm telling you all this because this is what's going on inside the mind of a young Christian Dior. This had the effect of making me think seriously about my own future.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

For the first time I wondered whether I was really devoid of any personal ambition. Up until this point, he didn't think he was ambitious. I was working all the time to achieve the financial success of another man. I was toiling in the bonds of his creative inspiration. And so there's a friend of his that is saying, hey, everybody knew who Marcel Boussac was. It's like he's one of those famous entrepreneurs and financiers at this point, and they're like they're looking for this somebody to make a fashion house. And meekly and with great reservation, Christian Dior offers himself up and he says, would I do? And that took a law firm to do because this is how he describes what happens. These harmless words were scarcely out of my mouth when I was overcome with horror. I suddenly foresaw the dreadful consequences of my rashness. This is not a self-confident man. This is not a risk-taker. He is terrified of risk. He just saw his entire family fortune, which goes back to his great-great-grandfather. His great-great-grandfather was one of the first people in France to ever import a bat guano, which is just bat s**_. His great-great-grandfather, I think in 1832, was the first person in France to import bat s_** from Chile and use it as fertilizer in Europe. That was the beginning of the Dior family empire, which had just collapsed 100 years later in the Great Depression. So it makes sense that he was terrified of being an entrepreneur taking kind of risk because he saw his family fortune that lasted 100 years disappear in one decade. And so what Christian Dior has at his core is imposter syndrome. And the way he got around this is he literally invented a character, an alter ego. This is very similar. If you ever heard Kobe Bryant talk about -- when he played basketball, he's like -- there's -- Kobe Bryant is only off the court.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

When I'm on the court, I'm the black mamba. And so throughout this book, Christian Dior talks about this. There's a Christian Dior, the person. And then there's Christian Dior, the designer, the courtier, the fashion house. That is over time at the very end of the book, which is published, he's writing right before he dies. He doesn't know he's going to die because he dies relatively young. He dies at 52 from a heart attack. But he's like, over time, they merged together. But at the beginning, he saw them as completely separate entities. Having entered very late into this profession where others have spent a lifetime learning and having had no training to guide me accept my own instincts, I had always been afraid of betraying my ignorance of it. He does not think he has talent. Perhaps it was this very fear of remaining the perpetual amateur that spurred me on to brush aside my doubts at last and invent the character of Christian Dior. And so this is his description of going to meet Marcel Boussac. And at this point, he was trying to restore this brand called Gaston to its former glory. And Christian Dior thinks, oh, this might be a good opportunity. And then he takes a tour and he's depressed. He's like, I don't want to do this, and this is what he says, my heart sank at the thought of the hazards involved. The cobwebs, which would have to be swept away, the difficulties of coping with a staff which had been set in its ways for so many years and would certainly resent changes. So essentially saying, I don't want to come in and fix this decaying company. I want to start from scratch and I want to do it my way is what he's saying. In short, it's the impossibility of making something new out of something old. In a trade where novelty is all important, I decided that I was not meant by nature to raise corpses from the dead. I was not meant by nature to raise corpses from the dead. My answer to him was no, as I sat down facing him, I suddenly realized what my true ambition was. Here was a famous financier who is at the same time, a man of wide and cultivated intelligence. I suddenly heard myself telling him that what I really wanted to do was not resurrect Gaston but create a new courtier house, I don't know to pronounce any of these French words, I'm sorry, but create a new fashion house under my own name. I wanted a house in which every single thing would be new. I described to him the house of my dreams.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I envisioned my house as a craftsman's workshop rather than a clothing factory, and so that's when he lays out this hugely ambitious project, completely different what Marcel Boussac had in mind. And Marcel Boussac being obviously a very formidable individual, very -- he's entrepreneur through and through, took a lot of risk. He said, okay, let's do this. And here's the unexpected problem. That's not what Christian Dior wanted him to say. When he hears that Boussac is definitely interested in his project, he spent several days in what he calls a tortured state of doubt. He is terrified of taking a risk. He says on my side, this was not intransigence from conceit. It was from a secret unacknowledged desire to escape from the whole thing. This feeling of panic eventually led me to send a telegram breaking off negotiations completely. Now this is why it's so important. It was at this juncture that I went to see my fortune teller. Now this is -- again, the mind is a powerful place. What you feed it, affects you in a powerful way. He believed this to be true. It doesn't matter that other people -- you and I from this vantage point is like, obviously, probably don't believe in fortune tellers, that's irrelevant. Dior believed it to be true. This conversation with the fortune teller actually convinces him regardless of your self-doubt, how terrified you are, you must do this. She ordered me sternly to accept the Boussac offer at once. You must create the house of Christian Dior whatever the conditions. Nothing anyone will offer you later will compare with the chance which is open to you now. I therefore resigned myself to the inevitable, listen to that advice. You must create the house of Christian Dior whatever the conditions. Nothing anyone will offer you later will compare with the chance which is open to you now. A True Craftsman So once he decided to go ahead, this is when he starts to -- the way I think about it is he starts building the Pixar of fashion houses, he's building a team of fanatics and Christian Dior is definitely a fanatic and so he talks a little bit about his thinking behind this. I knew that if I were to emerge victorious.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I had to be equipped with a first-class staff. So he's just going to go over a few of the first people he hires. So Raymond was to become my second self. She is my exact complement. She plays reason to my fantasy, order to my imagination, discipline to my freedom, foresight to my recklessness. She has supplied me with all the qualities, which I have never had time to acquire for myself. Another early hire is Bricard. Bricard is one of those people increasingly rare who make elegance their sole reason for being. She is superbly indifferent to such mundane considerations as politics, finance or social change. All she cares about is fashion and elegance. And this is one of the most important sentences in him describing her. Her high standards are inflexible. He finds and hires yet another fanatic. This is how he describes Margaret. Margaret is so much in love with her work that our partnership has had the character of a grand passion. If the world came to an end, while she was poring over a dress, I really do not believe that she would notice. Nothing is ever beautiful enough or perfect enough for her. She will stitch, unstitch, cut, cut again 100 times, and she still will not be satisfied. She was exactly the sort of person I needed, someone who's love of clothes equaled my own. And so in addition to hiring only the most talented people he could find, he also, of course, studied the history of the industry he's operating him. He's got a -- he talks about Balenciaga. He calls Balenciaga the master of us all. I go into more detail about that on episode 315, the episode I did on Balenciaga because it's hard to believe that they consider him the greatest of all the Paris fashion designers given the state of the brand today. But I just want to pull out one thing. He's talking about Coco Chanel, and I love what he said about her here. Outstanding among them all was Coco Chanel who dominated all the rest. In her personality as well as in her taste, she had style, elegance, and authority. I've done 2 episodes of Coco Chanel.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The one I'd recommend listening to though, if you haven't listened to it already, is episode 199. Coco Chanel was very different from Christian Dior in the sense that there's all these people that run into a very young Coco Chanel even before she was rich and famous, and just saw an unbelievable amount of talent and drive where, obviously, that's not true for people to interact with Christian Dior earlier in his life. In fact, one of my favorite things -- one of my favorite historical anecdotes about Coco Chanel was the fact that I think she was dating the Duke of Windsor at the time, and Duke of Windsor was friends of Winston Churchill. This is way before World War II. This happened in 1927. And we have copies of Churchill's -- the letter he's writing to his wife, and he talks about meeting Coco Chanel for the first time. And he says this in 1927 about her. And he said that, Coco Chanel was fit to rule a man or an empire. I just love that idea of Churchill writing about young Coco Chanel. So he goes back to, hey, this is -- I'm going after -- he's designing it for the rich. He wants the people to feel rich again. He wants to fight against this post-World War II austerity. So he says, I aimed at a fairly restricted clientele. There's a great line about Dior and Balenciaga that Dior was for the rich and that Balenciaga was for the wealthy. But he's talking about his relationship with Boussac. Boussac realized that he was dealing with a conscientious craftsman and not a megalomaniac. Craftsmanship, the importance of being a craftsman is something that Dior repeats over and over again. A few pages later, he repeats this. Far from wanting to revolutionize fashion, I was chiefly concerned with producing a high standard of workmanship. I aimed at being considered a good craftsman. He uses that word again, that idea of craftsmanship, something you and I talk about over and over again, Steve Jobs talked about it a bunch. My favorite description of this actually came from this biography of George Lucas. I read -- I think it's episode 35 of Founders. I read it years ago, I need to reread it because it's such an excellent book. It's called George Lucas: A Life. And is written by this author who does -- he's a great biographer, his name is Brian Jay Jones.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But in that book, this is what George Lucas said. My thing about art is that I don't like the word art because it means pretension and bulls_*_ and I equate those two directly. I don't think of myself as an artist, I'm a craftsman. I don't make a work of art. I make a movie. I just did Christopher Nolan's biography. I think it was episode maybe 317. He said the same thing. I feel more of a craftsman than an artist genuinely with people that get excessively good at what they do. He said that thing over and over again. Same thing, Brunello Cucinelli, in his autobiography. My goal is to produce high-quality items manufactured with Italian craftsmanship and manual skills. This is not a new idea. Socrates would go around Athens constantly asking people, he loved to question people about how they did their work, and there's a great line in his biography. It says craftsmanship fascinated him. And something Christian Dior talks about is the amount of work and time and effort that goes into building something that you can be proud of. Steve Jobs echoed that same sentiment. He says they have no conception of the craftsmanship that is required to take a good idea and turn it into a good product. As Christian Dior is building out his first collection, he says an idea that's really fascinating, that a lack of information and an increase in mysteriousness can actually cause speculation, and that this gossip is actually free advertising. He calls it free propaganda. It is widely and quite erroneously believed that when the house of Christian Dior was launched, enormous sums were spent on publicity. On the contrary, not a single penny was allotted to it. The relative secrecy in which I chose to work aroused a positive whispering campaign, which was excellent free propaganda. Gossip, malicious rumors are worth more than the most expensive publicity campaign in the world, and yet here's the interesting part. He was doing his best to avoid publicity and yet it found him, likely influenced by the fact that he was avoiding it. So this is likely influenced by gossips and whispers. And this is really important because he's going to get profiled in LIFE Magazine.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

What I would do, my first recommendation, if you want to learn more about Christian Dior, I would actually buy Paul Johnson's book. I'm going to leave links for both of them below. So I'd buy Paul Johnson's book, Creators, and I'd read chapter 13, which is on Balenciaga and Dior. And then if you want more, I would buy -- I would read them in the order, in that order. Then if you want more, I would buy The Autobiography of Christian Dior. I will leave a link down below to both of those books. And if you buy them using that link, you'll be supporting the podcast at the same time. That is 331 books down, 1,000 to go, and I'll talk to you again soon.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

His biggest customers by far were not the French. They were not the Europeans. They were the Americans. Think about where we are in world history. This is post-World War II. America economy is booming. And so this is an unbelievable lucky break. My most fortunate piece of publicity was quite unplanned. LIFE Magazine asked me to do a piece. At the time, I had no idea of the importance of an article on LIFE in launching anything. Like fortune, the guidance of publicity often seems to smile most favorably on those who court her the least. And what's fascinating is the closer he gets to the launch, the more nervous and the more tortured he becomes. His collections -- he's got really talented people. He likes what he's making. He's getting -- starting to get a lot of publicity, and he's constantly trying to like I need to run out of here. He's just -- there's just constant self-doubt that he's got to force himself to overcome. I felt that too many hosts are being pinned on me, and I was incapable of fulfilling them. It was only with the greatest possible reluctance that I was finally persuaded to show my dresses to my friends one evening just before their formal presentation to the public. And so the next days when he launches what they said was the most successful fashion line launch in fashion history, and there's a few sentences from here. The entry of each model was accompanied by gusts of applause. I stuffed my ears terrified of feeling confident too soon. It was an immediate success. The response by all the people inside of his fashion house couldn't be more enthusiastic and this is what he says. As long as I live, whatever triumphs I win, nothing will ever exceed my feelings at that supreme moment. And throughout the book, you just can't help but root for his success because really, it just comes down, he was obsessed with what he was doing. He loved it. He was fanatical about it. And at the end of the day, he -- essentially, when I'm reading this, there's a bunch of notes where I have to myself, which is like my interpretation of what he's telling us, I just wanted to make something that people love. And he says, all my pleasure arose from the fact that my dresses were being appreciated by the public. And he has a very unique way of describing the way he views his work. Design is definitely his entire life, and then everything he experiences fuels his designs. I must admit that clothes are my whole life.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Ultimately, everything I know, see or hear, every part of my life turns around the clothes which I create. They haunt me until they are ready to pass from the world of my dreams into the world of practical utility. This continues. I know exactly what I must give my designs, care, trouble, and enthusiasm. When I read that sentence, I was thinking of James Dyson's mentor, maybe the most influential person in his entire career was a guy named Jeremy Fry that gave James Dyson one of his first jobs. And one of the most important things that Jeremy Fry taught James Dyson was that you should believe most of all in the power of enthusiasm. You should believe most of all in the power of enthusiasm. Christian Dior is saying, hey, I'm going to give everything I have to my designs. I'm going to give them care. I'm going to give them trouble, and I'm going to give them enthusiasm. The most passionate adventures of my life have been with my clothes. I am obsessed with them. They preoccupy me, they occupy me, and they post-occupy me. This makes my life at the same time, heaven and hell. He was describing the fact that there is no off switch for entrepreneurs, which again, he was 41 years old until he discovered it for himself. Goes back to saying everything he experiences. The world is a classroom for Christian Dior, just like it is for da Vinci, which we're going to get to in a minute. Everything he experiences fuels ideas that he can use in designs. I scribble everywhere. Constantly putting ideas on paper is what he's talking about. I scribble everywhere, in my bed, in my bath, at meals, in my car, on foot, by day and by night. As Leonardo da Vinci walked in the Florentine countryside, he observed the patterns in the sand or the sky and transposed them into his pictures. My dresses take shape all around me as my fancy works on whatever it happens to see.

And what's fascinating is that Christian Dior had one of the greatest assets, which is humility in the presence of a good idea. He says, I give way to my instinctive reactions. So this idea is like I have an idea of my mind, I'm going to get it down on paper as soon as possible. Don't overintellectualize as it's like, oh, this isn't a good idea. Just get it down on paper. There was an advice that David Ogilvy got from this guy named Albert Lasker. I did a podcast on him as well. Albert Lasker is one of the most important advertising agency founders ever lived. He made more money in his advertising agency than any other advertising agency founder ever did. And this is what he told David Ogilvy. When asked what the best asset a man could have, Lasker replied, humility in the presence of a good idea. And Ogilvy says, it is horribly difficult to recognize a good idea. I shudder to think of how many I have rejected. Research cannot help you much in this domain because it cannot predict the cumulative value of an idea. Tie that into what Christian Dior just said, I give way to my instinctive reactions back to this internal battle that's happening. Like he just loves it. He's completely obsessed with it, but it also torments him. I will follow the progress of each dress like an anxious father. They have absolute power over me, and I live in perpetual dread that they will fail me. I find myself in a terrible mood all the time. what he's describing is, every year, he has to make new products. Every day, the fever mounts, new crisis arise, which I have to calm down. I nearly kill myself repeating over and over and over again that if the models go wrong, it is after all my fault and nobody else's. And the only way he deals with this intense stress and the torture that he imposes on himself, I would describe him, he's not really a grinder he has to in certain periods when getting a new collection. And then once it releases, he takes long, extended vacation. So I would say that way he works is sprint, rest, sprint, rest, sprint, rest. To me, peace and quiet are a necessity of life. If I am in one sense a very busy man. In another sense, I'm a very lazy one. The application and care, which I devote to my work are rooted in my desire to be finished with it as soon as possible. I am innately conscientious and therefore, never stop until I'm altogether satisfied with my work.

And maybe the most important theme, if I was going to remember one thing from his autobiography is, I just love people that truly care about what they're doing. I don't care what that is. I'm not interested in designing fashion dresses for God's sake. But I am intensely interested in people like Christian Dior. The most common note I have, that I leave to myself over dozens of pages in this book is, he gives a f_*_. He truly, truly cared. You can tell by the effort, the time, the enthusiasm he puts into this. And I just like the way he thinks about his work in very intense and passionate terms. I think of my work as a femoral architecture dedicated to the beauty of the female body. That reminds me of Enzo Ferrari. There's a new movie coming out on one of the biographies. I've read three biographies on Enzo Ferrari and they're turning one into a movie. But it's -- like -- the way I describe the obsessiveness and Enzo Ferrari is no doubt one of history's greatest successes. He had so in the game, and he describes his products the way you might describe your lover. Let me read two sentences to you. And this is Enzo talking about his cars. Does this sound like somebody describing a car. This kind of love, which I can describe in almost a sensual or sexual way is probably the main reason why I no longer want to see my cars race. To think about them, to see them born and see them die, because in a race, they're always dying. Even if they win, it is unbearable. He spoke about his cars as if they were alive. Cars possess unique behaviors. They breathe through their carburetors. They were skinned with metal. The engine of a car was both its heart and soul. Its rumble, the heartbeat of the creature. He said Ferrari's aim was to perfect an ideal to transform raw material into a living machine. This is incredible, right? We have Enzo Ferrari saying, I can't even watch my cars race. That's why he created them, how crazy is that. Because they're always dying, and it hurts me because it's -- I see my creation dying. Listen to this. Listen to this. This is a completely different industry. I'm pretty sure Christian Dior and Enzo Ferrari didn't even know each other.

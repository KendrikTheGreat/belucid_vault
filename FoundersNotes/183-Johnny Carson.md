"Johnny is the second unhappiest person I've ever known. I'm telling you this for a reason. Right here in front of Mr. Carson. Watch your step. Johnny's mood can go up to down in milliseconds. The situation about to be discussed would be very dangerous if word gets out. Keep a tight lip." Meanwhile, Johnny seemed impatient as if he had somewhere else to be. "Henry," Johnny said, finally arriving at the purpose of our meeting, "I have reason to believe my wife is cheating on me. I also have an idea who the son of a b_*_* is that she's shacking up with." No wonder, he had been restless. He had been sitting on a bombshell. "Well, I'll be happy to file a divorce for you if you want." "No, I don't want you to file for a divorce," he interrupted. "I want you to go with Arthur and me and some other guys when we break into the apartment to find evidence to prove that she is cheating on me." My first reaction was to be appalled. No way, I thought. Members of the bar do not break and enter apartments. And yet, this was an immense opportunity at the beginning of my professional life to land a very major client and launch my career into the stratosphere. I hesitated. Suddenly, we were off into the night, into the rain, through the traffic, entering the door of the suspected love nest. In the bright light of the lobby, the sunglasses Johnny had been counting on to cover his identity proved useless. "Hey, Johnny Carson," the doorman bellowed. But his delight at the sudden apparition of a celebrity in his lobby did not translate into a willingness to admit strangers into a residential apartment. "oh, no, I can't do that," the doorman said. "you wait here. I'll go get the building manager." Fortunately, the building manager turned out to be less committed to the sanctity of his tenant's domain. When I gave him a spiel about Mrs. Carson being the tenant, but Mr. Carson actually paying the bills, the manager appeared to be pondering the merits of my argument, which he did right up to the moment when Mullen grabbed his hand and slipped several hundred dollars into his palm. "Yes, okay," the manager nodded. "Come on up, I'll let you in." Almost instantly, Carson discovered evidence of his wife's infidelity. The whole living room, in fact almost the entire pad, was furnished with discards from the couple's apartment. There were even some pieces that Johnny hadn't realized were gone. "Look, it's him," said Arthur. He was pointing to a table in front of the window on which sat framed photographs of Joanne's playmate. For the first time, I realized her noontime buddy was Frank Gifford, the former New York Giants football great and sportscaster for CBS. Crushed by the overwhelming evidence, Carson leaned against the living room wall and began to weep. It was a painfully uncomfortable moment. While the rest of us tried to look away and give Johnny his privacy, it was, however, a small space and I couldn't always keep my eyes away. During one of those glances, I could see that Carson's raincoat had fallen open. I was shocked to see that Johnny was carrying a .38 revolver in his hip. I was beginning to feel exceedingly uneasy. Armed men, an emotionally ugly scene, a man in turmoil. Many an inferno has erupted with less kindling. Just as soon as Carson regained control of his emotions, the private investigator barked, "Let's go." Very little was said on the walk back to Johnny's apartment. The rain had subsided, but no one felt like recapping the raid. When we reached Johnny's apartment, he thanked us and said he was tired and wanted to be alone. He asked his houseman to give me a ride back home. As the car headed over the Queensboro Bridge, I realized I was probably one of the very few people who had ever seen Johnny Carson cry.

That was an excerpt from the book that I'm going to talk to you about today, which is Johnny Carson, and it was written by Henry Bushkin. And the entire book is filled with insane stories like that. I had a really hard time putting this book down. I devoured it in just a few days. I'll tell you where I got the idea. I had heard of Johnny Carson before. Actually the first time I actually thought about him, I was listening to a standup by Eddie Murphy. And he talked about -- this is back in the -- recorded -- the standup was recorded back in '80s, and he was talking about the divorce that Johnny was going through at the time. And he mentioned something that surprised me, because I knew previously that he was the host of The Tonight Show. But Eddie Murphy said that Johnny Carson had $300 million. It was like how did -- in 1980s. I was like how does somebody make that much money just hosting a late-night TV show. So we'll get into that today. That's one of the main points of the book about the importance of ownership. Johnny Carson's career has 2 completely different phases. The first half of his career, he is underpaid because he doesn't own the show. And the second half, he is unbelievably wealthy because he actually owns a show, which I'll get into. But the reason I'm reading this book, I was actually -- it was actually recommended by Marc Andreessen, Marc and his co-founder of a16z, Ben Horowitz, have this. I guess it's a live show on that Clubhouse app, but it's also -- they record it. And I listened to it on their podcast feed. It's called One On One with A and Z. And you can find it by going to the a16 -- I think it's a16z Live, if you search for that in your podcast player. They have an entire list of all these different Clubhouse shows. So it's not like a dedicated feed. And I think he has only done 5 or 6 episodes. But Marc is one of the most fascinating people. Any opportunity you have to hear him speak, I do. He has read probably, I don't even know, thousands of books in his lifetime, it seems. He has read probably hundreds of biographies. So he's just a constant fountain of good ideas and good book recommendations. And so he talked about -- on his podcast, he talked about reading this book and being very surprised by the difference of who Carson was in his private life as compared and contrasted with who the public knew him as arguably the most famous entertainer in America at this point in history.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so I want to jump into the book. I'm going to give you a brief bio of him. This is really not a complete biography. It focuses on about the 20-year history, because the author that wrote the bulk, Henry, was Carson's attorney, enforcer. He did all these roles, which I'll go into in a minute. But mainly, it's on the time in Carson's life from about 1970 to almost 1990. So let me give you a brief bio of Johnny Carson before this. He was born in Iowa in 1925, raised in Nebraska by his mother, Ruth; and his father, Homer. He served in the Navy, went to the University of Nebraska, broke into radio and then in television -- he got a start in actually Omaha, Nebraska. And then he moved to L.A. where in a typical up-and-down television career, this is a really important sentence and a really smart idea, he took a shot at every opportunity that came his way. And interesting enough, he wasn't NBC's first choice to succeed Jack Paar, which was the host of The Tonight Show before Johnny. He was actually the fourth or fifth choice. So Bob Newhart, Jackie Gleason, all these other people were approached, hey, do you want to take the show. They all passed, which is interesting to think about, because it's this show more than anything else that's going to give Johnny Carson a net worth when he passes away of about $450 million, which blew my mind. So Johnny starts on The Tonight Show in October in 1962, and then he actually retired. He sticks with the show for 30 years, retires in 1992. But this is one sentence in the book that I thought was really instructive. He caught a break and made the most of it. And before I tell you more about how he did this, I want to tell you who the author is, so we have an idea of the subjective nature of this book. They were extremely, extremely close for 18 years, and they had a falling out. He writes the book about a decade, decade-and-a-half after that falling out. So he says I worked for him for nearly 2 decades. I was his lawyer, counselor, partner, employee, business adviser, earpiece, mouthpiece, enforcer, running buddy, tennis pal, drinking and dining companion.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

A good portion of my job entailed cleaning up his messes, business messes, personal messes and family messes. And one thing that I appreciate that the author talks about is that it was by far the most complex relationship he ever had in his life, the one we loved the most and hated the most. And so as a byproduct of that, we're going to see Johnny Carson in the most positive attributes that a human can have and some of the most negative. I want to go to how important he was -- how important it was that he focused on his main job. And this is going to come up a lot in the book where he is being pulled and pushed in different directions by advisers and other people. And yet he just wanted to do The Tonight Show. He was -- it's -- when you read the book, there's so many crazy stories that it's easy to forget that Johnny was the best in the world at what he did. And being the best in the world at anything is not going to come easily, and it's not going to come without putting a lot of hours and effort into your actual craft. So this is about him setting the standard. Many people came after Johnny, but all of them kind of pale in comparison to how -- because he created the blueprint for all these other people that followed after. So it says, you would think that by now, the questions would have stopped. After all, he went off the air in 1992 and he died in 2005, long enough ago for people to have lost their curiosity about Johnny Carson. But that's not the case. Indeed, in the years since he has been gone, Carson's status seems to have been reinforced. Talk show stars have proliferated, but Johnny is now beyond a star. He is the undisputed champion, the universal standard. As talented and popular his successors might be, each of them is still doing a monologue about the day's events, still sitting at a desk, making jokes with the band, still calling out Tonight's first guest and still following Carson's footsteps across the landscape that will be forever his. And I was doing some other reading about Johnny. I came across this description of him by the director and producer, Billy Wilder, and I want to share it with you right upfront, because I think he really talks about the role he filled for millions of people. He had an audience about -- I want to say around 20 million people watched him towards the -- I think that was 20 million people at night.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So a large number of people, especially given the overall population of America at the time. But also the amount of -- he was very prepared. There's a lot of -- his approach to his craft -- I read the book, and yes, it's wildly entertaining, really actually fun to read, but it came across with a deep appreciation for how serious he took his work. So it says, this is a quote from Billy Wilder, "By simple law of survival, Carson is the best. He enchants the invalids and the insomniacs as well as the people who have to get up at dawn. No matter what kind of dead-a**_* are on his show, he has to make them funny and exciting. He has to be their nurse and their surgeon. He has no conceit," on the show that he is. "He does his work and he comes prepared. If he is talking to an author, he has read the book. Even his rehearsed routines sound improvised. He's the cream of middle-class elegance and yet not a mannequin. Every night in front of millions of people, he has to do an aerial somersault performed on a tightrope. What's more? He does it without a net, no rewrites, no retakes. The jokes must work tonight." And so this is the author more in like this complex relationship, which I really appreciate him pointing out. He says, "This is the most complex and stimulating and challenging relationship of my life, the most rewarding and the most disappointing, the one that a quarter century after its end continues to provoke, irritate, delight, amuse and sadden me. He and I were together longer than he was with 3 of his wives. And he and I were closer than he was with any of his friends, family or professional colleagues." He gives us more detail on his personality. "He was endlessly witty and enormously fun to be around. He could also be the nastiest son of a b_*** on earth. The truth is that he was an incredibly complex man, one moment gracious, funny and generous and curt, aloof and hard-hearted in the next."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And now we get to the paradox of Johnny Carson that Marc Andreessen was talking about, the fact that he was a world-class entertainer who happened to be an introvert and a loner. "Never have I met a man possessed of a greater abundance of social gifts, intelligence, looks, manners, style, humor. And never have I met a man with less aptitude for or interest in maintaining real relationships." He was referred to as the most private public man who ever lived. So now he is going into more about understanding Johnny's complexity and the way he differs from like an actor, even though they're same, entertainers. Really this whole section reminds me, it's not what you do, but how you do it. And I would also say that what Johnny figured out is if you're going to have any kind of longevity at all, you have to be yourself. You can't play a role for 3 different decades. So think about your favorite actors, some of mine are Al Pacino, De Niro, other people like that. A lot of their greatest work was done earlier in their careers. It's really hard to keep up that levels of intensity for multiple decades. And so when you think about Johnny, he really chose consistency over intensity. So it says, to understand Johnny's complexity, one must first understand his artistry and esteem in which he was held. This is not an easy thing to do. If you were to talk about a great movie actor, it would be simpler. His transformation into his character would be evident. The range of behavior he depicts would be obvious. The subtlety and nuance of the human experience that he illustrates would grab you by the throat. Actors played characters. They inhabited invented identities, brought to life by a carefully constructed script. But Johnny took the stage just as himself, relying mostly on his own native gifts. As much as he felt like he belonged in the company of other show business giants, he didn't care much for their company. He often told me that all it took to turn the most electrifying film stars into dullards was to be around them for a while, but he felt that way around everyone.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

There were very few social scenes in which he had ever -- he was ever really comfortable. He was known to describe dinner parties as torture. Ed McMahon, his famous psychic and friend for 46 years, once said that Johnny was comfortable in front of 20 million people, but uncomfortable in a gathering of 20. He was a habitual loner who guarded his emotional privacy. So I want to tell you a little bit about the finances behind a show like theirs or like his -- his show printed money. But like I said earlier, he didn't build wealth until he owned the show, and he had to get himself into a position where he actually had leverage to grasp ownership of the show. And I'll go into detail about that because how they did it was very fascinating. And I don't know if you know if it was intentional. In 1979, when he was hosting the program 4 nights a week for 90 minutes at night, as he had been doing it for 17 years up until this point, so from 1962 to 1979, NBC was earning $50 million to $55 million per year from his show, in 1979, that's crazy. So there's a couple of big ideas that you could take away from studying the life and career of Johnny Carson, one of which I already mentioned or two, I guess, the importance of focus, the importance of how much time and effort you put into what you're doing. But really another one is he really knew -- Johnny knew his circle of confidence, and he stayed within it, which is so hard to do, even when he was tempted. And another smart thing he does, you could wave millions of dollars at him. If it took him away from what he actually wanted to do, which is talk show, he didn't care. He understood that after a certain point, there's a decreased marginal utility to an extra dollar. And so he -- after experimenting, he started radio and then he started doing like these game shows, once he found his niche, he just stayed in it. He knew that he was going to be gifted at what he was doing. He says, Carson was part of the next generation. He grasped that he owned the camera, the way Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra had grasped that they owned the microphone. That understanding made him more natural, more relaxed and cooler.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And one thing we also -- or I guess, 2 things we also learn when you're reading this book is the fact that he was emotionally unavailable and obsessed with control. This is about the fallout from the end of his second marriage due to him catching her cheating, which is really weird because he talks about over and over again -- actually, I'm going to run over my point, because I know I'm bringing this up later. But he got married, he was married 4 times in his life, never faithful at all, never a good husband at all. When he finds the second wife -- her name is Joanne, when he finds her cheating with Frank Gifford, I mean, he is out every night in New York City with a different woman. So it's really interesting to think about how complicated we are as humans, because he is grasping the wall, crying, can't believe she did this to me, but he did much worse to her way more frequently. So it says, Johnny wasn't head over heels in love with Joanne anymore, if he ever was. He probably loved her as much as he could love anyone. But women had always come and gone in his world. I don't think he would have been too torn up if she had merely gone. What he hated was to have the emotional turbulence invade his world. And this storm was huge. It forced him to react to someone, which he only felt comfortable doing it at times and in ways that he chose. He was constantly obsessed with controlling all aspects of his life. And then as you can imagine, finding your wife cheating on you, even though you've been cheating on her every day, he didn't like that brought to him now. Now I have lacked control. I don't have control over the situation. Now you're making me feel pain, and I don't like this. And so I'm going to go backwards in the story for a minute because I want to talk about when -- how Henry gets the job, he gets introduced and goes on his job, interviewed to be Johnny Carson's lawyer through like a friend of a friend. And he is -- I think he is like 27 years old at the time. Johnny, I think, is 45, already famous. And so we see the doubts, inner monologue, the night before the interview. And he is just like, I don't fit in here? Like what am I even doing? He says, sleep did not come easy that night. Try as I might, I could not imagine how I was supposed to fit into the star-studded world of Johnny Carson. And it gets even weirder when we see the interview the next day with Johnny. Carson came in and immediately got down to business. There wasn't any small talk. He seemed indifferent to me and impatient to be done. When he asked questions, he did a little more than read my resume back to me. You went to Vanderbilt Law School, you're member of the New York Bar.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I was becoming seriously confused and not a little impatient in what was shaping up to be a big letdown. Finally, he asked the question that surprised me completely, you play tennis, right. Yes, I played in college. Why? I play tennis, it's my sport. If you work for me, I'll expect you to join me. I look forward to it. That was it. The interview was over. When my wife asked me how it went, I said it was stupid. He didn't seem very interested in me. In that last line, based on my reading of the book, I don't think he was very interested in other people. In many ways, I think Johnny built a world within the world. And you could speculate maybe he did this because of his upbringing. And there's a lot in this book about the terrible mother he had. But it does serve as a reminder, you can be one of the best in the whatever you do, you can be unbelievably wealthy, and it doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to be content and live a happy life. He gets the interview -- or he gets the job, goes on the raid the next day. Then Johnny calls him at 2:00 a.m. the day after the raid. And this is where we see peculiar personality that a lot of humans have. There's a wide spectrum of behavior in humanity, right? So it says -- so this actually says, Johnny calls them at 2 a.m. the day after the raid to meet him at a bar in Manhattan. And this is the inner monologue of -- I keep calling him Harry. His name is not Harry. It's Henry Bushkin. I want to call him Harry Bushkin, I don't know why. Okay. So this is the inner monologue of Henry, not Harry. And talking about like why am I willing to get out of bed and then scurry over there at a moment's notice. Perhaps I had felt drawn to the guy. Maybe it was just the last 2 days of my life had been so incredibly different from the first 27 years that I figured I owed it to myself to see what happened next.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I love that paragraph because reading these biographies -- this is just one of many crazy stories that we've covered. It's a daily or weekly reminder that life is supposed to be an experience. Like we can treat it as an adventure. We can have fun. You don't have to try to be perfect or rigid. Life can be whatever you want it to be, whatever it is that you want to make it. And you get to the end of the book, yes, Johnny Carson definitely made a lot of mistakes, of course. Anybody would in his position, but he really, really lived. He took advantage of the opportunity to be alive. So anyway, go back to this part. Now they're meeting up. It's around 3:00 a.m. in the morning. Johnny at this time in his life is a heavy drinker. He is drinking almost every night. He also smokes 4 packs of cigarettes a day, which is really unfortunate because he dies of emphysema. And towards -- at the beginning of his life, he says don't try to get me to stop smoking. At the end of the life, his brother says, one of the last conversation they ever had, he just kept repeating, these d*** cigarettes, these d*** cigarettes, these d*** cigarettes. So just a reminder, we're going to avoid that as much as we can. Johnny sighing heavily finally spoke, "I'm not surprised that Joanne did this to me," he said. "But it hurts. It hurts like hell. Maybe I drove her to it. I wasn't the best husband in the world. I should have been home more, not running around." Johnny was lost in self-regret and self-loathing. I'm a s**_. I have 3 kids with my first wife, and I don't see any of them. The more Johnny talked, the weirder this moment seemed. People I had known all my life, my best friends, none of them wouldn't burden themselves to me. But here's a man I had known for 2 days, and he was baring his soul. Johnny continued, "If a doctor opened my chest up right now, he couldn't find a heart or any goddam thing, just a lot of misery." And I just want to pause there before I finish this paragraph. Think about that, he is 45 years old. He has one of the best jobs in the world. He is famous. He is highly paid, even though he has a c_**** contract, which I'll get into how they fixed that in a minute. And he is not happy. And I think that's just a constant reminder that wealth, success, fame, even if that's really what you want, is not going to make a great life. They can add to an already existing great life, but they don't make them by themselves. And we've seen this too many times. There's too many of these books that we read, and we discover these people are not content.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

There's something inside of them that they haven't dealt with. There's a hole that no matter what they do, as much success and the money they put into it, it will never fill. And we kind of see that with Johnny. "my mother made sure of that. She deprived us of any real g**_*** warmth." And so everybody that meets his mother arrives at the same conclusion. She is a very cold woman. She didn't take any pride in his accomplishments. She never gave complements. She was bereft of any kind of love. And that's terrible to have to grow up like that. But a lot of people have bad family. So a note I left myself here is he blames -- and he is not just doing this later. He does it now, but he also does it later in the book and later in his life that he blames his failed marriages on his mother. But he is 45 years old when he is saying this. And my note to self here is you have to have some kind of personal responsibility. We can't control the poor life experiences we had as children, the family we might have been dropped into that wasn't loving or whatever the case is. But what are you going to do? If you never deal with that, it means the rest of your life, you're going to be unhappy. That's not -- that doesn't make any sense. You've got to deal with this. Whether you work it on your own, you go talk to somebody, whatever it is, but you can't be holding on this baggage 25 years, 30 years after your childhood is over. Now let's get to the money because this is a really surprising part. Again, I talked about Eddie Murphy standup, saying he's got $300 million. At this time, he has got almost no money. So where is the money? Facts reveal themselves little by little, like layers of an onion, curious facts, disturbing facts, like the fact that Johnny Carson wasn't wealthy. Indeed, he had very little money. He had little money because the people around him, whom he trusted, were serving him poorly. He was being taken advantage of and the deals and the managers -- and this is -- it's a tale as old as time, talent being taken -- and this is why you have to learn these things yourself, right? People being s**_*** over, their managers stealing money from them. I mean this has happened millions of times to the point where we know that this is -- we have to have a good defense, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I'll get into that later. But he says he was by and large alone and his life was a wreck. The mess in his personal life was obvious. Carson was 45. He had been through 2 marriages that ended painfully. He was the father of 3 sons whom he seldom saw. And he'd drink to excess nearly every night. He also had a manager and attorneys that just were not really looking after his interest. Well, one attorney actually does something that I would argue might be smart to do. It's this idea of deferred compensation. So this is one of the reasons he is low on money. Again, he doesn't have ownership in the show yet, but he is still getting paid $100,000 a week, but he is only getting $3,000 for that. This is really surprising to me. NBC was paying Carson $100,000 a week to host The Tonight Show. That's $5 million a year. But Carson didn't even have access to 1/10 of that income. Instead, he was receiving a check for $3,000 a week, with the rest being deferred. Now why are they doing this? His tax attorney negotiated this deal in 1967 when the income tax rate was 70%. The deal prevented the government from devouring Johnny's income, but it left Carson with just enough to cover his admittedly extravagant expenses and nothing for savings or retirement. The company would -- the company, NBC, wouldn't have to pay the balance for decades. And so here is where you could see kind of why this idea might be -- might not be a bad idea. It's also true that the real value of the deal was a hedge, a bet against Carson's talent. Had he flamed out after a few years and become a pop culture footnote, then the deal would have been an insurance policy that would have protected his money and preserved his capital for the years after his popularity had evaporated. And so there's something that's in present day that's similar to this. This is the Bobby Bonilla deal, it's called Bobby Bonilla Day. He was a very famous baseball player, one of the highest paid people. But anyway, he signed this unique deal. Went retiring in 2001, I think, and starting -- and he deferred his compensation for the New York Mets, right? And so every -- from 2011 for -- over the course of 25 years, right, starting in 2011 running till 2035, he is paid, let's say, $1.2 million every year.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And this is happening a long time after he retired. Now he is in his 50s. I think this runs up until maybe he is in his 70s. When every time this -- and it winds up hitting like the news and current events every year, it happens, and people are always debating, this is stupid, he should take the money, put it in an index fund, and just left it there. And I understand what they're saying. But they're not accounting for human nature. A friend of mine works for a nonprofit that's set up because it's -- they help former athletes. I think it started off with NFL, but now I think they've expanded it to other retired professional athletes. Because at the time, the stat -- he told me the stats were something crazy, it's like -- I forgot the exact number, let's say 90% or 95% of the people that retire from the NFL wind up in bankruptcy. And so they find them jobs, they help them with money, everything else. But again, I understand their point, hey, take the money, put it -- in this perfect world, in theory, in other words, yes, he'd have -- Bobby Bonilla would have more money than if he didn't defer this. But now he is going to pay $1.2 million a year. He doesn't have to worry about money. Again, I always would take what actually happens in the real world over theory. And so Carson's experience is something like that. Now he is still going to get s because there's -- the people around him, they're just like vulture-like. The entertainment industry is really disgusting industry when you get down to it. And I'll get into more about that, how his agency is like -- he is getting paid $3,000 a week. He is supposed to be getting paid $100,000 a week. So his agent -- agency is supposed to make 10%, right? So it's $10,000 a week, right? So they send them a freaking bill for $10,000 a week. That's more than triple that he is getting paid. No doubt, talent getting taken advantage of by management. It's the tale as old as time, I just said that. You have to learn these things. Like Ed Thorp, Founders #93, my personal blueprint says you need -- so he talks about the need. If you're going to be successful in life, he talks about in his book, getting rich is one set of skills, staying rich is another. So he talks about getting rich is like having a good offense, but staying rich is having a good defense. And it's very easy for you to lose your money.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He talks about more people go broke on bad investments than they do just overspending their income. So the idea that you need a good defense, this is the role -- good defense is a role that Henry Bushkin is going to play for Johnny's wealth. So he is integral in getting Johnny ownership. And then after that point, once they sign that deal, I think, in 1980, Johnny will never have to worry about money a day in his life again. Sonny -- so this is the manager that Henry fires as well. I guess, Johnny fires him, but Henry takes over for him. Sonny was milking Johnny for too much cash. This is ridiculous here. Johnny Carson wore a new outfit on his show each night. Like any good manager, Sonny recognized an endorsement opportunity. He negotiated a deal to launch a new label, Johnny Carson Apparel. This was a very shrewd idea. But as I studied Johnny's contract, I was shocked to realize that we owned no equity interest in the company. Instead, half of the equity was owned by the manufacturer and half was owned by the manager. Are you kidding me? Carson, in effect, was paid a salary to wear clothes from a company that bore his name, while the man he had entrusted with his affairs lined his own pockets. So we see 2 very important ideas from just a short paragraph there. One, you have to have equity. That's where wealth is built. You're never going to build wealth without it, right? Number two, read your contracts. Don't take the word of other people. If your contracts are too long or too complicated for you to understand, reduce the scope of the contract. We -- there's no -- no one is going to do this work for us. We have to have our own defense. No one is going to do that for you. This is -- a reminder, this is not where you want to be when you're 45 years old. Look what's going on, I said. His wife is cheating on him. His manager is s**__* him. His agents are exploiting him. And his producer's wife has been conspiring with Joanne to cuckold him. What a g__** mess? So what they're talking about there, his producer's wife. So the producer on -- this is -- again, this is just -- you don't want these shady people around you. Listen to this crazy scenario.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So his producer on The Tonight Show, his wife is the one that helps Johnny's wife set up this apartment in her name, so she could go and cheat on Johnny with Frank Gifford. Vultures. Okay. So this is how they handled William Morris wanting 10% of Johnny's deferred compensation and really reminder that things are malleable. And you can get out of bad deals with a little creativity. I asked him to handle Johnny's issue with William Morris Agency. We all recognized they're entitled to 10% of what Johnny was actually making on the contract. And every week, they would get $300. Their position that they were entitled to 10% of deferred compensation, which is now coming decades in the future, maybe a decade in the future from here, which is crazy. Their weekly bill for $9,700 that they insisted on sending him was galling and insulting, since they knew they were asking for more than triple than what Johnny was actually earning. I turned the matter over to Jerry. They bring in another guy. Jerry solves the problem with one phone call. He got on line with his good friend who works at William Morris. And he says, here's our offer, drop the claim or no William Morris claim will ever be booked on The Tonight Show again. So he had to play a little hardball back. This is a reminder. Now I'm going to tell you a lot of these crazy stories because these things were really interesting to me. But I don't want to gloss over the fact that Johnny was the best in the world at what he did, and he focused on that. That is extremely smart and important lesson. Johnny wanted Henry's help with everything, but his show. Don't get involved in my show. I got that. Your role as my lawyer is going to involve a lot of different things. But the one thing I don't need any advice on is how to run my show. Stay away from that. So that's a good idea. Now let me alternate that with a bad idea. Selfishness with your children is a character flaw. Little humans are the best humans, and they rely on us to be the best versions of ourselves we can be, so we can serve them. We cannot be selfish with our children and Johnny was. It's true that by any standard, Johnny was not a very good father. He was concerned about his sons, but he was not a significant presence in their lives. They don't care about money. Kids are not saying -- they're not going to say, hey, give me money instead of having time with my parents. They care about your attention, right? And Johnny didn't give his kids his attention. Johnny was very much a member of a generation of men who saw their principal paternal obligation as providing for their families material wellbeing. Well, then do both. It's not either or.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

That notion was used not only to excuse long hours and demanding schedules, but let's face it, it was also an excuse for a lot of selfish behavior. Go back to this idea when it came to his work, he knew he was good and he worked hard at it for a long period of time. Think about working on a show your entire life, is wrapped up in his career, something he did it for 30 years, for 3 decades. Very few people work on the same thing for that long. And so it says, Johnny Carson lived comfortably in his own skin. He may have been troubled in certain areas, but he was never tormented by insecurity. And part of the way he got away from what a lot of people feel is like their professional insecurity is the fact that he knew he put in the required work to be good at what he was doing. He did not skirt that. In fact, you can make the argument that he dedicated so much time to it at the expense of other areas of his life. I can tell you more about his mom because she is like the next main character in this book. I mean it's mentioned so many times. As the day of their first visit to his new home approached, they've already moved to L.A. at this point in story, Johnny grew increasingly tense. Johnny warned me how difficult his mother could be, how begrudging of compliments and how withholding of affection she was. His wife, Joanna -- okay, so this is his third wife. This is confusing. His second wife is named Joanne. His third wife is named Joanna. "Joanna was bending over backward to make mom feel welcome," Johnny said. She took her on a tour of the house, explaining all the features. Mom said nothing, silent, like a fish. Finally, I said, "Well, mom, how do you like the job Joanna did? It's beautiful, isn't it?" And mom said, "Well, John, the wall covering reminds me of your aunt Maude's dining room."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And that was it. Not another word. Ruth Carson was a person who was impossible to impress and impossible to please. She seemed to take no pride or pleasure in her son's accomplishments. More on how he worked -- and really think about it, the one constant in his life -- wife is going to go. Friends are going to go. He changed his cities and houses and everything else. But the one constant in life, which is work, and he took it very seriously. I know I'm repeating myself, but it's an extremely important part and, again, something we can apply to anything in the world that we're doing. He and his producers critiqued every show immediately after completion. There were days when everything was perfect, and there were days when nothing worked. That's going to happen all of us, right? But Johnny always knew if the show worked. He always knew. And so I went back -- remember, this is many years before my time. So I went back on YouTube. In fact, his estate still owns all of the clips and everything from the show, and I'll tell you about how much money it brings in, it's insane. But I went back and just watched a bunch, I don't know, a couple of hours' worth of just his monologue, the way he interviews. This book is going to paint somewhat of a negative picture of him because it's being written by somebody who had a falling out with him. But I could see the appeal completely. Even decades after he went off the air, he was extremely affable, he was interesting, he was entertaining, funny. I could see why he drew 20 million people to him. So now he doesn't have the deferred compensation yet -- or deferred compensation anymore. So he is actually making really good money. He is actually getting the money in his pocket. The tax rates are lower at this point in America as well. But -- he still doesn't have ownership of the show -- I'm going to get there, I promise. But -- he is finally making money, but he is not really interested in anything, but his show. And this is going to be a point of contention and really the falling out of their relationship. And I don't think Johnny was wrong in maintaining his focus. And I'm going to read something from another book and a little bit on that. But it says, "With my advice, Carson headed a group of investors who bought a local television station. We bought the TV station for $1 million, renamed it. Not too many years later, we sold it for $25 million."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So just remember that part. He makes a good amount of money, doesn't really care. Again, after -- if he was broke, he'd care, but he is making enough that he is just not going to do anything he doesn't want to do to make just a little bit of extra money, including what they wanted to do, real estate. He does do -- like he has a failed franchise thing. He does a couple of things, but he eventually walks through -- I think the author puts it like, he walks through that door, takes a look around like being a mogul and building giant businesses, and he is just like I'm not interested. I just want to work on my show. Johnny, at this point -- he has got also -- again, another crazy story. Being super famous has a lot of downsides, too. He is being extorted. They left a package at his house saying they're going to kidnap his wife and his stepson. And so at this time, it was very common. There was a bunch of people being -- kids and relatives of famous people being kidnapped. And so they're saying, hey, drop off, I think, $0.25 million in -- at this phone booth, or we're going to kill your wife and stepson or whatever. And so they threatened -- and they say that he has to do this. They want to make sure he is the one doing the money drop. The police are like, hell, no, you can't do this. Like what if you can be put in danger. Johnny insists on being the one to drop off the money, which is really -- it says a lot about him. He is like, listen, I don't want to play games with this guy. I'd rather put myself in harm's way than me not -- me send somebody else and then he wants to try to kidnap my wife or anybody else. So he says, Johnny insisted on doing it, so not to make the extortionist mad and endanger the lives of his wife and stepson. That's my note. The police not only hate Carson's role -- this is after it happened when doing a dummy drop of money. Like a 26-year-old kid shows up and tries to pick up. I mean what did you think was going to happen, guy? Like 15 minutes after Johnny does the drop, just like 26-year-old kid goes to pick up the money and gets arrested. Okay, guy. The police not only hate Carson's role in the drama, they in fact denied it.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The official statement said specifically that Carson was never in the car, but he did take part without a moment's hesitation. This is one of the guys -- one of the FBI agents. Johnny has got brass b_*_*, and he did. I don't think Joanny ever forgot how fearlessly Johnny put himself personally on the line to protect her and her son. When things soured between them, her gratitude for his unquestioning love for her during this time nonetheless did nothing to keep their marital dispute on fundamentally respectful plane. So that's another thing. I always think -- really, I've been trying to keep it in my mind for a long time. This idea where Charlie Munger says, listen, you're going to go much farther in life by avoiding dumb things than by being brilliant. Being brilliant is almost impossible over the long term, but being not stupid is very doable for most of us, right? And so Johnny, he lost a lot of money because he refused -- first of all, why are you getting married if you're just going to cheat on them every day, right? But then the second point is like if you're going to do that, do a prenuptial agreement. So his second wife, they get divorced. He winds up having to pay her $6,000 a month from -- so he has to pay her $6,000 a month until either Johnny dies or she gets remarried, whatever comes first. If somebody is paying you $6,000 a month, you're not going to get remarried, right? So he winds up paying her $6,000 a month from 1972 until he dies in 2005. His third wife -- he is making a lot more money at this point. He is -- he winds up paying her, I think, $35 million after their divorce. And the reason I say it's easier to be not stupid than be brilliant is he knew this going in. He warns Henry, he is like, don't let me do this again. And yet, he keeps repeating that same easily avoidable mistake. Moving on, this is repeated over and over again in the book. Obviously, when that happens, it's very important. He could perform in front of 20 million people, but not 20. Johnny, who generally suffered fools not gladly, or almost not at all, for Johnny, sustaining fake sociability for hours and hours was taxing to the max. So any introvert in the world knows that feeling.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Another thing about Johnny. He has to be the #1 priority. And if you don't do it -- and this is where Henry messes up later on, too. Anybody in his life that's not going to put -- that's -- whether he was married to you or he has hired you, if you're not -- if you make it clear that he is not the #1 priority in your life, that relationship is going to end. Johnny needs a cause for war. In the case of Joanne, it was her infidelity. In the case of Joanna, it was her desire to attain independent status through her charity work and then by starting a fashion consultancy. The rule that he applied to agents and managers and lawyers also applied to wives. He had to be #1 without a meaningful #2. And then we get into kind of like the sad part of his life. And it's got to be really hard being that famous. You never know if people actually want to be your friend or if they just want -- he can make or break your career. He could sell your product. There's all kinds of things that being friends with him, there's benefits to that. And from his perspective, it's really hard to know who actually cares about him as a person, almost impossible to know, and who is just using him. But this is -- this comes from an article it's being written and interview that he is doing. And really, you shouldn't have to pay your best friend. Johnny had very few people around him that he wasn't paying. And now I think about maybe none. "When you're at home," the interviewer asked Johnny, "whom do you entertain?" "Henry Bushkin," Johnny said, "my lawyer who is probably my best friend." The answer left me profoundly touched and somewhat astonished. We were certainly friends. And although we socialized together frequently and although our wives were close, never did I think of him as my best friend. I was always working when I was around Johnny, thinking of what he needed. Guys whom I could just relax and hang out with, that's who I call my best friends. It had simply never occurred to me that he thought of me as his best friend. Okay. So let me go back to the business end of his life. In 1979, he gets the idea. It's never clear to me if he really wanted to quit, if he would have followed through on it, but he is threatening to quit NBC might have been the best idea he ever has, because this is how he gets ownership of the show.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Carson had, at some point in the beginning of 1979, decided to bail in the most coveted spot in television. Giving up the job would mean giving up a compensation package in the neighborhood of $10 million a year in 1979. That's crazy. "I'm done," he said, "I'm tired. 17 years is enough. I'm 54. Can you imagine me doing this when I'm in my 60s. That would be absurd." He actually does the show until he is 67. Johnny, you can't quit like this. You have a contract they won't let you out of. They'll never let you walk. Make it clear to them that I'm not leaving, so I can work for someone else. You know your show is the most profitable on the network. They'll come after you for all the money that they'll lose in advertising revenue. Fred Silverman, the guy running NBC at the time, has got a million problems at his network. You're the only thing he can count on. He'll go nuts. I don't care. It's not his a** in front of the camera every night, and it's not yours. Nobody can force me to work. They'll figure it out. What was that line -- so he talks about, you're indispensable, nobody can replace you. And Johnny said something really interesting. He said, they will figure it out. What was that line Charles de Gaulle said? The graveyards are full of indispensable men. Johnny had absolutely no fear about the consequences of his decision, but I did. And that's one of the reasons we worked so well together. And so this is the state of the show when he wants to quit, which is really, really surprising. Carson was an unrivaled asset who earned the network immense profits. When he took over the show, the show averaged an audience of 7 million. In 1978, the nightly audience averaged 17.3 million people. Shows usually hit a peak after a couple of years and then start losing viewers. Carson had more than doubled his audience. I already said this before, but I'll remind you, Carson's show in 1978 was earning NBC between $50 million and $60 million.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

There had never been a credible competition from any quarter, and there was none on the horizon. Johnny's intentions baffled them. Who the hell quits in their prime. So Henry goes to meet with the President of NBC and other people. And he says, Henry, we want our guy to be happy. But you must think me nuts to let this f**_*** guy go. You're an attorney. You know it doesn't work that way. We've got a contract, and it's got 2 more years to run. So this is where there's like -- the debate is because the show changed from New York City to L.A. California has a law where it limits a personal service contract up to 7 years. It can't be longer than that. And their point was like he has already fulfilled that. That contract is null and void because he moved to the California. Skimming over all the part, I just want to tell you what Fred Silverman said. Don't expect us to roll over because of some technicality. If we have to tell our sponsors Johnny is leaving, we'll stand to lose $50 million a year. We'll go after Carson for that. We'll sue his a** for $100 million. And so Henry points this out, like this is a bad move. You're going to sue the most beloved entertainer in America for $100 million. Even if you win that one, Fred, you lose. And at this point, we still don't know why he wants to quit. It's really never resolved. So it says, Johnny was tired and frustrated. But what I really didn't know was how much of those feelings was due to the accumulation of the normal day-to-day b_**_*_* that everybody experiences in any walk of life and how much was due to the situation at NBC at this point. They had low ratings. Really, they're just going -- they're struggling. Fred was brought over to turn around NBC. And the only bright spot really was Johnny's show at the time. And this is -- so now Henry is talking about the difference between what Johnny is making and what other people are making. And he talks about where -- like who actually has the money. And the summary of the section is equity makes all the difference. Being a star in Hollywood is a fabulous thing. But the real money and power went to those who own the companies that produce the programs. It was Aaron Spelling who called the shots and raked in the dough and lived like the sultan of Brunei, or put another way, Merv Griffin who was a rival of Carson's, but never his peer, but was so much richer than Johnny because he owned the game shows like Jeopardy! and the Wheel of Fortune.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so once word gets out that there's going to be a lawsuit -- it winds up being a private litigation that's settled by a mediator between Johnny and NBC to see who is right about the technicality of the contract. This time, ABC hears about this. So this is really smart, too. Even though they're not allowed to, Henry goes and meets -- has a meeting with ABC that so "not a meeting", but it's like getting around -- within the letter of the law, but certainly violating the spirit of law at this point. Later on, ABC insists on them meeting in international waters. I mean there's just so crazy stuff that goes on in this book. It says, it was not a bad little meeting. I had managed to approach the line of propriety without crossing it, and the intelligence I had gathered was priceless. I now knew how much ABC was interested in acquiring Johnny and how much they're willing to pay for the privilege. I knew that we were holding better cards than NBC. If Johnny won the lawsuit, he was facing his choice of some highly interesting opportunities. If NBC won, all they would get is 2 more years of an increasingly disgruntled host. So what they're shooting for is what Merv Griffin, Aaron Spelling, other people had. Think about this as if they can do it, why can't you? He would be positioned to become a veritable entertainment mogul. Merv Griffin had done it with his talk shows and game shows and he built a very substantial business for himself. Dick Clark had done the same, building a huge production business that did American Bandstand, the Golden Globe Awards, and all sorts of specials. Neither man had the star power or the access to talent that Johnny possessed. So the judge winds up agreeing with Johnny and Bushkin. And so this is interesting. Before he was being compelled to do something. Now Johnny can choose if he wants to do it or not, and that seemed to soften his desire to want to quit. Johnny's feeling about the network began to soften. Now that he no longer had to stay, it was starting to seem possible that he would. So now they can actually start to negotiate with other people in earnest, and they find out what ABC was offering. And it's crazy.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

ABC would double Johnny's salary, whatever it was. They didn't even ask what it was. They just said, we'll double it. Johnny would have carte blanche to do as he pleased. He would own the show, and he would control the time slot immediately after his show. So in other words, leverage obtained, right? As grateful as we were for ABC's attention, what we had in our hands now was not a contract, but a lever. At minimum, it would be a convenient template for whatever he might decide to ask from NBC. It could also be something more powerful, a minimum bid that would spur further largesse. Something also happens, he wins another Emmy as he is about to negotiate with NBC, which I'm sure doesn't help -- or excuse me, doesn't hurt, but he doesn't care. And this is really the way Johnny thinks about something about this. I'm going to read this to you. It reminds me of what Steve Jobs said. So let me tie these 2 together, if you don't mind. Johnny was suspicious of flattery that all too easily came to people in his position. He knew audiences and was pleased when they liked his work. He knew ratings and took pride in what they proved about his appeal. He treasured the respect of his peers in the industry. Awards, however, were all but irrelevant. He had too -- this is the most important part of this section, okay? He had too keen on appreciation for how much work and talent and discipline went into success to be flattered by praise and adulation. That is very similar to what Steve Jobs said. He is like, listen, most people do not know the amount of craftsmanship required -- the amount of craftsmanship that lies between a good idea and a finished product. And when you know how much work you put in and how much work -- and how hard it was, it relieves this insecurity, this imposter syndrome. Like no, no, I know why this is good. Now this is very interesting. So they're figuring out, okay, do you want to take ABC, do you want to stay with NBC, whatever you want to do here? And they go to speak to Lew Wasserman. So Lew Wasserman -- I actually read a biography on him. Because he was probably the most powerful Hollywood titan for multiple decades. He ran Universal, and MCA or, I guess, MCA and then Universal is the proper sequence of events.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And he is much older at this point. He has been around forever. So Johnny goes and asks, like what should I do? And this is just a reminder, sometimes the best advice is the most simple advice. And they make their decision based on one single data point. Like most oracles, Wasserman gave an opinion that was simple and sensible. "it's not prudent," Wasserman said, "to ask people to change their nightly viewing habits. Once they are used to tuning into a given channel, they find it hard to make the move, no matter how good an alternative is being provided elsewhere." Was that it? All of our thinking and talking and arguing and agonizing came down to the belief that Americans won't change the dial. Wasserman's advice sealed our decision. So now we've entered the second part of Johnny's career when he finally gets equity, when he finally is able to build, when he is able to finally reap all the benefits of how much work and effort he put into. And this is bananas. They brought in NBC with them -- well, I can't read. They brought him what was, by far, the richest deal ever offered to any single individual in the history of television and entertainment. Carson's salary would be $25 million a year. For that, he worked 1 hour at night from 11:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m., 3 nights a week, 37 weeks a year with 15 weeks off. In addition, Carson became the owner and producer of The Tonight Show. He also took ownership of all the show's episodes that had been made since his arrival in 1962. And this is going to blow your mind. To the extent that they existed into the 70s, the networks routinely destroyed, discarded or taped over much of their programming. Are you kidding me? When we -- and then this is a reminder to sell your byproducts. So of the old shows they did have, though, they created this thing called Carson's Comedy Classics. These were edited clips from old Tonight Shows, okay?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

They were a series of half-hour shows that Columbia Television bought for $26 million. Carson had 0 cost for the material. Johnny -- this is really interesting, too. Johnny Carson occupied a position, the likes of which had never before existed and possibly never even been matched except perhaps many years later by Oprah Winfrey. That's an interesting way -- interesting parallel to think about. Johnny Carson is like the Oprah Winfrey of his day. So that's the good, right? Now here is something, a reminder of a mistake to avoid, you've got to keep your ego in check. He winds up doing like the -- Frank Sinatra asked him to host like the inauguration, I guess -- I don't know, [ parade ], I guess, some kind of -- something on TV where he -- they needed a host for Ronald Reagan. It was like 1981 or something like that. Johnny didn't want to do it, but he idolized Frank, so agrees to do it because he thinks it round -- he is forced to talk to a bunch of politicians. He doesn't like doing this, and it's not part of his show. But what happens is the next day, he was told that he was going to be like personally escorted around the White House by Reagan. I think they had known each other earlier. I think Reagan -- if fact, no, Reagan had been on his show previously. Obviously, Reagan was an actor before he was a politician. And he just flips out because he winds up having to go on a tour with like other people. And he's throwing a fit, yelling at Henry, yelling at the people that organized this thing for Frank Sinatra, so much that somebody got Reagan to call him the next day and apologize. And it says, when the newly inaugurated President of United States made the call to soothe the wounding feelings of a talk show host and his socialite wife, he had already had much on his mind. Soviets in Afghanistan, Sandinistas in Nicaragua, the wellbeing of the American hostages who had just been released, the prime interest rate that stood at 20%. It was truly a testament to the power and prestige that Johnny had now gained as a performer and a person that the President called him over a minor issue of protocol. It was also a reminder that Carson's ego had grown so large that only a call like that could pacify him.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Back to Johnny's work ethic. He wanted -- there's this dichotomy here. He wanted to stay busy, yet he also wanted a lot of time away. One of the things that surprised me when I first got to know Johnny was how often he went on the road. You might think that a television host who did 5 90-minute shows a week and earned 7-figure salary would be content to enjoy some time off, but Johnny really preferred to work. He didn't want to go home. Domestic life bored him. Besides, he didn't like relaxing all that much. He liked performing. He liked being on stage, being the center of attention, and doing something he did with supreme excellence. There's also something I want to bring to your attention. This entire -- there is an entire chapter dedicated to the shenanigans that went on in Vegas in the 1970s. So I'm just going to pull a couple of highlights. And really, again, everything else that we're thinking about here, trying to learn from the greatest entrepreneurs in history, trying to avoid their mistakes, copy their best ideas. It's also like we need some reminders that life should be fun. I think as Elon Musk has said, there's got to be a reason to get out of bed every day. A lot of the stuff he does and pushes himself up to these extremes, because he thinks it's like he is on the grandest adventure he could possibly have, right? So this is just reflecting on some of the best times of their lives, and he is writing this 30 years after it happens. And it's just like, let's have fun, let's reflect -- I mean you're going to miss the times when you don't have the opportunity to have -- like not only to like go out and have these experiences, so you always have the memories your whole life, but you're going to regret not having those memories if you don't go and make them. So he talks about all the people coming to Vegas at this point. There's entertainers. After the shows, they'd all meet up, Johnny Carson, Frank Sinatra, Bing -- all these people, Bob Hope, just everybody you could possibly imagine that was famous at the point. And it says the scene creator of these gatherings was beyond anything I had ever experienced. Everyone in attendance was supposed to bring new material, and Carson was no exception.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Johnny told jokes brilliantly and armed with great material and free from television censors, he was hilarious. He always held his own in the unofficial contest to see who could deliver the night's topper. These were the funniest moments of my life, and I'm pretty sure they were among the happiest of Johnny's. These sessions also often lasted until 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. or however long it took Johnny to come down off the high of performing in front of a live audience. I was usually ready to drag my exhausted self to bed, but often, Johnny was ready to soldier on. In this next section, my note is longer than the highlight. It says he agrees to do a show at Caesars Palace. What's interesting is the challenge of matching Sinatra was more important to him than the money and also a reminder that the longer you stick with what you're good at, the more time your value has to compound, which produces oversized returns like these. And this is the highlight from the book. I was pretty pleased with the terms I negotiated, 8 weekends a year for $2 million. But the money was not the deciding factor. For Johnny, it was the challenge. "I might as well play the best hotel in the strip, Johnny said, "and let me see how I can do against Sinatra's counts." Meaning how many people -- how many tickets he can sell compared to how many tickets Sinatra can sell. More -- I mean there's crazy stories in the book from Vegas, as you could imagine. That's going to happen with unbelievably wealthy and famous people. One paragraph for you here. I felt well enough to go back to the party. To my surprise, the 3 girls were skinny-dipping in the rooftop swimming pool, while Johnny, wearing nothing but an apron, served them wine from a silver platter. More on the unusual benefits that if you let -- if you keep you constantly adding value and let it compound over a long time, get you -- Coca-Cola offered to buy Johnny's company for $100 million, and they offered Johnny a seat on their Board of Directors. And he was just completely not interested. He is not interested in the money. He is like, why would I go and sit on the Board of Directors?

And Henry is like, this is one of the most iconic companies of all times. He is like, I want to do my show. I was on a flight to Atlanta to meet with the Chairman of Coca-Cola, who as it happened was also a big fan of Johnny's. We had a terrific conversation. They wondered if we might be interested in selling. How about a swap. This is their production company, by the way. I asked Carson, how about a swap, I asked, you give us Coca-Cola stock, and we'll talk about a deal that delivered us $100 million? Johnny, I just said, he is not interested. I'm skipping over that part. I can't say I was entirely pleased with Johnny's decision. This is also going to cause a rift later because Johnny does not want to be an entertainment mogul. He wants to work on his show. And again, this is where I think Henry is wrong. Henry is like, I negotiated this contract. He could own television. He could invest in real estate, doing all of these things, I'd be running the business for him. And I'm going to read this paragraph. It comes from the book I did last week, which is Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist. And again, I don't think how many people realize this. If you study the history of entrepreneurship, study how the great fortunes are made, it's not a scattershot approach. Does Jeff Bezos need to make any other investments besides in the world that he generated from Amazon? No. Johnny didn't either. What is better use of his time and money than dedicating to his show that's going to make him hundreds of millions of dollars. I don't understand this frame of thought. So it says, would John D. Rockefeller, the oil cartelist -- that's an interesting word. Andrew Carnegie, the steel baron; Sam Walton, the retailer; and Bill Gates, the software nerd, having common is that each owes his fortune to a single product or innovation, bingo. Almost all of Jeff Bezos' wealth is going to come from Amazon. Almost all of Mark Zuckerberg's wealth is going to come from Facebook. Almost all of the Google guys' worth is going to -- fortune is going to come from their own company. Johnny is no different. And so this is where, again, you're being hired to put his needs in front of your own and you get distracted. That is a cautionary tale for us.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I don't think Johnny was mistaken. Like again, he is already wealthy. His show is going to make him more money. Why he starts producing other shows? He is like I don't even like this. Like why would I do that? It just doesn't make any sense. Time is literally what life is made up of. Why would you spend it doing things you don't like to do that makes -- Henry is wrong here? And this is this -- here in my next note I wrote to myself, why would you start a company that needs to produce hit TV shows? Says he didn't know -- Johnny didn't know what went into making his television series successful. He wasn't even a particularly enlightened viewer. Johnny Carson performed on TV. He didn't watch it. So then why are you pushing your client to start shows and to figure out how to produce a hit sitcom. He doesn't make a sitcom. He makes a talk show, a talk show that's the most popular in the world. That's where his time and effort should be. He starts going through another divorce here. And really the reminder is, note to self, what's the point of success if you don't enjoy it. I really -- this book made me ask a lot of questions. Like if you look -- if you could see the notes in the book, I'm like, they're just -- I have a lot of questions. I don't understand the logic or the decision making here, right? And it made me think of the book -- the autobiography of the guy from Kinko's Paul Orfalea, I think is his name. And he says something in that book that's really, really wise from somebody who has ADHD and dyslexia. He is like I don't have answers. I have a lot of questions. And so I'm just going to keep asking questions. And I think there's a lot of wisdom in that simple thought, right? Johnny changed during the divorce proceedings. And I don't know if he ever entirely changed back. He was always capable of being a miserable prick, the nasty remark, the stony silence, the surprising indifference. That had all been part of his repertoire ever since I knew him. But they were usually interruptions in a generally more genial mood. Now these stormy moments came more frequently and there was an overall harshness and impatience, intolerance that wasn't there before. This is also where they start to -- they're deviating. Henry is also becoming more successful in his law practice in part of the proceeds brought by Johnny Carson's growing. He is running Carson Productions. He is doing deals. And again, he forgot the -- he Pat Riley said something that's really smart.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And he said when he was recruiting LeBron James, but he said over and over. He is like, always keep the main thing the main thing. And so when he recruits LeBron, LeBron hadn't won championships at the time. Meets with him, drops whatever, how many rings does Pat Riley have, 6, 5, 7, something like that, just drops them on the table. This is the main thing. You want to win championships, you come and play with me, and let's wind up working, right? But he also talks about it in his own life. In fact, I should read the autobiography of Pat Riley because he is a very interesting person. I hope I'm as half as cool as he is when I'm his age. And he is in his 70s this day. But we see here that Henry didn't keep the main thing the main thing. Johnny did keep the main thing the main thing. That's really, really smart. I know I'm repeating myself, I'm sorry. But it's such a powerful idea, and I want to slap myself in the face with that idea to make sure I don't forget it. Making money beyond a point was the distraction, but also why direct attention away from the show? These are my own notes. That's where he will receive the best return, I've already said that to you. His profitable clothing business closed up shop, in part because it required Johnny to model the clothes in advertisements, and Johnny no longer had the patience to spend a day or 2 modeling in return for a couple of million dollars. This is what I meant about -- he is not very different from Ed Thorp. I mean Johnny is way more flawed. I feel Ed Thorp, Founders #93, everybody have learned from the podcast, he is just -- he might be the -- he is the one that didn't -- he didn't over-optimize in one area of his life at the expense of others. He took care of his health, had a good relationship his wife, good relationship with his children, didn't work past and pursue more millions of dollars after he already had more money than he could ever spend in his life. He lived the life of adventure, did things with Claude Shannon, invented one of the first wearable computers, wrote a best-selling book on how to count cards in blackjack. And he is still alive to this today. Go watch YouTube interviews. I just watched one, probably have been a year or 2 now, maybe 1.5 years, I don't remember when I did that podcast. But he is 87 years old.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This guy mastered life. So many people we study, lost, didn't keep the main thing the main thing. And Ed Thorp realized the most likely outcome for a great life, a life with no regrets, life that he truly enjoyed, is to have -- is to identify the things in my life that are most important to me and balance those things together. And so just like Johnny sitting here and saying, no, I'm not -- you're not going to get 2 days of my time for a couple of million dollars when I'm already making -- at this point, he is making like $50 million a year, something like that. And Ed Thorp turned on multiple investment opportunities that he was pretty sure -- remember, Ed Thorp created what many people believe is the first quantitative hedge fund. And then later in life, realized I just wonder -- he didn't like working for it a little bit. He didn't have big companies. Later in life, I think it was like 4 or 6 people he worked with. There's some wisdom in there, too. I think a lot of more people are satisfied with smaller companies is my guess. We just saw that in the Amazon Unbound book I just did. You get to the end of the book and you realize, oh, wow, being the CEO of Amazon isn't fun. How do you know it's not one? Because Jeff Bezos gave up the job. And if he wanted the job, he'd keep it. Sorry, back to the story. We just see -- we see what Johnny is doing here. He is not the first person to come up with this idea that what's an extra $2 million if I already have hundreds, right? Especially if it required me to do something, I don't want to do. So it says, he closed up the clothing company because he no longer needed the money. He declined to make a commitment to buy this hotel in Vegas called The Aladdin because it would require him to appear -- he was actually -- again, another smart thing. A lot of these deals, they come with like strings attached. Okay, I'll let you buy the hotel, but then you've got to perform 12 weekends a year. Well, I don't want. And 12 weekends a year, whatever it was, I forgot -- let's say 10 weekends here for the next 5 years. No, I don't want to do that. I want to work on my show and then spend the time however I want to spend it. He declined to make a commitment to Coca-Cola. And I'll skip over the rest. I want to get to the main point here. Making money beyond a certain point held very little interest for him. To him, making money -- or excuse me, to him, making movies was the distraction.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So now they're talking about -- he has got the production company. They're making movies, shows and all that sort of stuff. And he eventually -- he doesn't sell it, but I think he closes it down. So from Henry's point of view, bad idea. From Johnny's, good idea. All my wealth is coming from my show. You're asking me to do things I'm not interested and that will take me away from doing my show. So Henry just described and would say, hey, this guy is being depressive, being more of a prick, I think is the word he used, than normal. But also we see the same person that could be unbelievable mean to you can also be unbelievably generous. Henry's mothers died, and we see Carson has a famously generous side. He winds up sending -- when he lived in New York, there was a guy on a steakhouse who never let him pay for a meal. Decade-and-a-half later, the guy comes -- has trouble. Johnny sends him $100,000 without him asking. Just -- he could be unbelievably -- this is the paradox. We're all very complex creatures. We -- I'm sure you could be -- I know I can be sometimes mean and unbelievable generous at the same time. And hopefully, over a longer period in life, we realize that, that's important to be as kind as possible. I always go back to what Jeff Bezos' wife's grandfather said, very wise person, very profound idea in just a few words, pulls Jeff out when he is a kid. Says, hey, Jeff, one day, you're going to learn it's harder to be kind and clever. And then we'll probably be happier in life with just kind of people around us as much as we can. Even in my grief, I was conscious of how uncommonly considerate Johnny was being, but this just blew my mind -- sorry, Henry's dad died, not his mother. I don't know if I said his mom died, but I meant to say his dad. He asked for my mother's phone number to call my mother personally. And that wasn't all. When I arrived at my parents' apartment, I found that Johnny had sent beautiful flower arrangement as well as platters of food. He knew as a tradition in Jewish homes to have this kind of food on hand to offer mourners. When I called to express my appreciation, my mother got on the phone and broke into tears, and she thanked him. Now back to the negative side. Some people would say that being friends with Johnny is really just friends in name only. Joan Rivers was a permanent like guest host, because later in his career, he only would host 3 or 4 weeks a night -- or 3, 4 days a night. So he'd have a permanent guest host for a few years. She actually takes an opportunity presented by Fox as a new network at the time.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Johnny never talks to her again when she does this. But she talks about that. Like he says, I'm his friend, but we were never really friends. Later in her memoir, Joan offered a credible explanation as to why she felt she had to act the way she did. As Joan points out, being one of Johnny Carson's nearest and dearest show business friends didn't entitle you too much. For example, it didn't mean he ever spoke to you, at least not off the set. Johnny would almost never greet a guest in their dressing rooms before the show. He wanted to save all the energy and spontaneity for the audience. Beyond that, the list of people whom he liked to socialize with was short, typical introvert, right? And Joan's name wasn't on it. Instead, she spoke to intermediaries instead of Johnny. He always kept the buffer. He did this constantly. He did not seem to me very interested in -- he had like a small circle. And then anybody outside the circle, he kind of closed himself off. That's what I was talking about earlier, where he built a world within a world. And so she jumped at it because it's a tempting offer. She's got good money. She'd be the -- she had the procedure -- her own show, instead of being a guess host of somebody else's. And she was the first woman ever to have a late-night show. Now this is the crazy part. Johnny's mother died later that year. "The wicked witch is dead," he said, when he called with the news. It was a bittersweet remark, jokey without being funny. In other words, it was true. He loved his mother as a son must, but he did not like her. From all that Johnny told me, his mother ignored his needs and burdened him with guilt. She was indifferent and lacked emotion. She damaged him, damage that manifested itself in adulthood and difficulties with bonding, decision-making and depression. Johnny Carson enjoyed the adulation of millions, but his mother could not love him. He carried that pain and spread it all of his life. This is another idea where we touched on earlier, consistency over intensity. He had probably been funnier longer and more consistently than any other comedian who ever lived.

On The Tonight Show, Johnny just kept rolling on and on and on, never deviating, seldom surprising, seldom surpassing, but always delivering. Let's go back to Johnny's unique view on money and the freedom it brought him. Unlike Sinatra or Crosby or Hope or any other truly wealthy entertainers, Johnny had The Tonight Show, a cash cow that week after week paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars in salary, and it was relatively easy money. Sinatra had to travel the world giving concerts. Johnny had to drive to Burbank. Once he got control of The Tonight Show, he was earning so much money that it was like monopoly money. He was free to do literally whatever he wanted. He could ignore a sweet deal from Coca-Cola because he didn't want to make a lasting commitment. When he didn't like modeling for photographers for 2 days a year, he could afford to close down his multimillion-dollar clothing company. When he got tired of playing nightclubs, he bailed on Las Vegas dates. When he decided he didn't like going to see the rushes of movies and production, he closed up his company's successful movie division. And when he got tired of being the CEO of Carson Productions, he decided to rid himself of the company. And again, we see that contrast. Henry hates what he is doing. Johnny, from his perspective, is acting completely rational. He is spending all his time where it's most valuable and what he likes to do. I would do the same thing. And so it was during this time, Johnny hires Bear Stearns to try to sell Carson Productions. Henry and other people are running Carson Productions. He doesn't want it to be sold. And Henry goes behind his back and does something -- he tries with like excuses behavior towards the end of the book, but dude, you were supposed to be serving Johnny, you didn't. You go and try to negotiate a deal that you were not authorized to do. And then you hid a line from him about it. He just forgot priority #1. And again, a question -- here's another question, but let me throw a bunch of questions. Why would you not tell Johnny? It's his business. He owns it. Here's the thing.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It would be much better if they bought Carson Productions. So Henry is having a conversation with the guy running the production studio. They have a show, it's called Amen. Never heard of it before, but it was successful in its day. And they found a company that would let the show continue on and let this producer and Henry still run it. And then Johnny wouldn't have to worry about it. And so Henry likes what he is hearing. He is like, okay, I'll go meet with them in secret. And this is going to destroy his almost 2-decade relationship with Johnny. Implied, but unspoken was the additional benefit that we wouldn't be working with John anymore. I liked the picture that Ed had painted. And unbeknownst to Carson, I met with the Tribune people. After long consideration, they advised me they would offer $60 million for the business. And instead of going directly to Johnny, he goes to somebody else, another one of Johnny's advisers. This is where Henry is going to make bad -- the reason I'm reading all this to you is because he makes bad move after bad move after bad move. These are poor strategic decisions. And kind of being a snaky, weaselly person, if you're being honest about this. I was unsure of myself. I called Fred for advice. "Don't tell Bear Stearns about this," he warned me. "It really wasn't up to you to talk to other people about selling the company. Let them get the best offer they can." And Fred also gave me some personal advice. "Face facts," he said, "Johnny is involving new people. It's because, so far, he likes what he's hearing from them. So give them some space to show him what they can do. But don't make the mistake of underestimating Alex or Michael Klein, who are also working for Johnny. And this is where he does another dump thing, another bad move. That was sound advice, and I didn't follow it. I felt compelled to advise Michael Klein of the offer. Why did he do this? Because again, he is thinking of himself. If Bear Stearns or Michael Klein, they get Johnny a deal, that might not let Henry run the company. So he tells him about this other idea, even if it would be less -- because Bear Stearns thought they could get $90 million. But Henry is coming to him with a deal for $60 million, but he gets to run it. This is just bad, bad move, guy.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I felt compelled to advise Michael Klein of the offer. Keep it confidential, I told him. Yes. So in other words, don't tell Johnny. What are you doing? If everything else fails, that deal is out there. He directly went to Carson and told him that Ed and I were trying to steal his company. Carson summoned me to his Malibu house. "I talked to Ed Hookstratten," Johnny continued, referring to one of Beverly Hills' most prominent lawyers, "He'll take over. Let's talk about you. What's fair between us? At that moment, I realized that guillotine had fallen, and it's also his fault. He tries -- later on the book, he kind of gets a little -- trying to justify his actions, which I understand if you're in his position, we might do as well. But from an outside perspective, dude, you brought this on yourself. No need to offer an explanation, no point in engaging in a discussion, and certainly no call for sentiment or nostalgia. One year's compensation paid over the next 12 months, I said plainly, and my share of the proceeds when the company is sold. It's a deal he said. We shook hands and I left. And just like that, my 18-year association with Johnny Carson came to an end. And this is where he gets into his justification. But really the bottom line is, he wanted what was best for him when he was hired to do what was best for Johnny. I did nothing that harmed his interest, but it's true that at some point, his goals and my goals, which had always been united, diverged. The contrast also could have allowed him to -- or excuse me, the contract, not contrast, the contract he is talking about. Now he is going back to the deal he negotiated where he gets ownership, the production company, and all sort of stuff, right? The contract also could have allowed him to be rich, powerful, and influential producer of films and television programs, the likes of which Hollywood had yet to see, if only that's what he wanted. I helped him walk through that door. But after seeing what life was like on the other side, he decided it wasn't for him. He didn't want the aggravation, and he certainly didn't need the dough. But having walked through the door with him, I discovered that I liked running the company, doing deals, working with creative people. Running Carson Productions suited me. So our interests were in conflict.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then he goes into the destruction of a relationship that was one of the most important relationships in his life. And it's really a reminder that you have to put people over money. You can always make more money. But if you truly care about the people in your life, don't let it fall apart over a business deal. The issue that promised the greatest potential for anger and bitterness, the amount due to me for my percentage of Carson Productions was handled with professionalism. I got more money than I would have under the proposed terms of the company's sale to Coca-Cola, but I lost the friendship of the most interesting man I had ever known. I was not a winner in this deal. Johnny terminated our relationship in a 3-minute conversation, a swift, unceremonious end to a long and profitable run. There was no final act. It felt as if someone unplugged the projector in the middle of a movie. I never saw Johnny after we broke up. The truth was I missed him and hoped he was missing me too. And he really wraps up what this entire book is about with one sentence, my attempt to paint an accurate portrayal of the most thrilling, fun, frustrating, and mysterious relationship of my life, a portrait of a man I love, and that is where I'll leave it. It was an absolutely entertaining great book. Marc Andreessen has always kind of give us good book recommendations.

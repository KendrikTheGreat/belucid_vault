He has this idea that sounds counterintuitive to other people that are not entrepreneurs, and he says, "Listen, only the arrogant are self-confident enough to push their creative ideas on others." And he said, "Steve believed that he was always right. And he was willing to push harder and longer than other people who might have had equally good ideas, but who caved under pressure." And so we've seen an example of that. Of the 4 executives at the top, Levchin, Musk, Thiel and himself. Harris would say with a laugh, this guy was forced out. He was the CEO for a couple of months. Harris would say with a laugh, 4 guys and not a single one of us had an ego that would fit in a large gymnasium. And one thing they disagreed on is that he wanted to bring in like these older people to -- people with experience. And this is what -- this is Elon on the value of being a young whippersnapper, which I thought was funny. He was -- so Elon is saying, "He was going to tame us young whippersnappers," that's his words, "With these like seasoned financial executives or whatever." And we're like, these are the same seasoned executives of these banks who can't do Jack s_*_, who can't compete with us. "Doesn't make sense," Musk said. He believed that whippersnappers like Peter, who's loss troubled Musk because Musk -- so again, a lot of stories I have to omit. Peter is not getting along with this Harris guy and Musk isn't either.

And finally, to Venice, to whom this book is dedicated. The idea for this project started when you were a 1 year old, and it was completed when you were 6. The intervening 5 years have been among the happiest of my life, in large measure because you made them so. You, too, indulged my stories about Max Levchin and Elon Musk, and you offered wisdom of your own kind in my moments of doubt about the project. You are unlikely to remember most of what happened in these last 5 years. I will never forget them. Authors of books like this should usually refrain from burdening readers with lessons. The reader is smart enough to figure those out for themselves, but there's a special acknowledgments-only exception to that rule for author dads. And I'm going to take advantage of it to offer you a message in a bottle for whenever you get around to reading these words. Here goes. Your life will be shaped by the things that you create and the people you make them with. We tend to sweat the former. We don't worry enough about the latter. The story of PayPal isn't just of people banding together to shape a product. It's about how banding together shaped the people themselves. The founders and earliest employees of the company pushed and prodded and demanded better of one another. I hope you find people like that, too, and that you make things with them. That sounds simple, but it's awfully hard. I've been fortunate. I have a sequence of those people in my life, many of whom have been named in the previous pages. You know them as Auntie Lauren and Auntie Grace and Uncle Justin and so on. They are the people who hold me to account. We don't just enjoy one another's company. We make each other better. Our friendship rests on productive discomfort, and we love each other enough to say what needs to be said. In a funny way, I'm not sure I can play that role for you. There are lessons I love you too much to teach you. So you'll need to go out and learn them for yourself. Fellow travelers will help. Books need editors; lives do too. As with all my advice, take it with a Very Hungry Caterpillar-sized grain of salt. Besides, I may not have to worry. If you crack this book open at all, sat with it this long, and made it this far, maybe you'll be just fine.

That is an excerpt from the book we talked about today, which is The Founders: The Story of PayPal and the Entrepreneurs who Shaped Silicon Valley and is written by Jimmy Soni. And that dedication to his young daughter comes at the very end of this incredible, incredible book that I'm holding in my hand. I was able to talk to Jimmy, and he sent me an early copy of this book. He's a -- if you're a longtime listener of the podcast, you'll recognize his name. He wrote one of the best biographies I've ever read. It's -- I think it's Founders #93. It's the biography of Claude Shannon. And so once this book arrived in the mail, it reorganized my plans for my entire week. I've spent most of the last several days completely engrossed in the book. And normally, when I sit down to talk to you, I'm excited. Today, I'm a little nervous. I do not think I'm going to be able to do justice to just how great this book is for entrepreneurs or founders, or anybody trying to start a company and do something really -- anybody trying to do something really difficult in their lives. So all I can do is just jump right into it, and we'll see how this goes. So I'm going to jump right into the introduction. The very first word in the book is a quote from Elon Musk. And if you read actually in advance this biography of Elon, you know this is his favorite word. And it says, "F_*_, you're making me rummage around the attic," said Elon Musk. We sat in his living room, but the metaphor still fit. Musk was about to tell me the story of PayPal. As he spoke about the internet's development and PayPal's origins, the story spilled out about his first internship at a Canadian bank, about building his first start-up, then his second, about what it felt like to be overthrown as CEO. By the end of the afternoon, nearly 3 hours later, I suggested we pause. We had only scheduled an hour together. And though Musk had been generous with his time, I didn't want to wear out my welcome.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But even as he stood to show me out, he launched into another PayPal story. 47 years old, Musk spoke with the enthusiasm of someone older asked to relive his glory days. "I can't believe it's been 20 years," he said. It was hard to believe, not just the years that had passed but how much PayPal's alumni had accomplished in them. And then he goes into some of the influence that this PayPal mafia, the alumni network has had. So he says, "Both in the foreground and behind the scenes, PayPal's alumni have built, funded or counseled nearly every Silicon Valley company of consequence for the last 2 decades." For its admirers, PayPal's founders are a force to be emulated. For its critics, the group represented everything wrong with big tech, putting historically unprecedented power into the hands of a small clutch of techno-utopian libertarians. Indeed, it is hard to find a lukewarm opinion about PayPal's founders. They are either heroes or heathens depending on who offers the judgment. And yet despite all that, the PayPal days themselves are usually glossed over. If the early years come up at all, they are typically granted a polite paragraph crediting PayPal for making the latter -- the later splashier achievements possible. The group's subsequent successes are so legendary, and their controversy is so conspicuous that they steal the oxygen from the origin story. And in these next 2 sentences, I double underlined, and I even jotted in the book, nailed it. “To skip PayPal's creation is to neglect the most interesting stuff about its founders. It is to miss the defining experiences of their early professional lives, one that defined so much of what came later.” He just gets it. That's exactly what you and I try to do here. If you're able to see the books that I highlight, 70%, 80%, 90% of my highlights come in the first half of the book, maybe the first two-third of the book before they were rich and famous and successful. It is always more interesting to learn about who they were, like what versions of themselves built the foundation that their now current or future success lays upon.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I saw a tweet from another -- his name is Antonio. He read the book as well. He's an author. And he says something fantastic about -- he's like, it's obviously highly recommended. You can clearly see that. I think you should buy the book right now. This is a book that you're going to reread. I'm going to wind up doing podcasts on it, years down the line. There's just so much information here. It's not only the personalities you get to learn, like what was Elon Musk like in his 20s? What was Peter Thiel like in this 20s? What was Reid Hoffman like when they were at this age? But it's also just they're so creative. And there's just so many times I put down the book, I'm like, that is really, really smart, what they just did there. It's so -- it was so complicated and complex what they had to achieve. And yet their response and the ideas they came up with, it just -- it's remarkable. But what he said is, "The book is full of improvisation and gumption, fear and arrogance." It perfectly captures the drama of early-ish Silicon Valley and now big players when they were just hustlers trying to figure it out. And so aside from Elon Musk, nobody is already rich when this is happening. Elon had just sold Zip2. He has this funny line in the book we'll get to later. He's like, "Overnight, my bank account went from having $5,000 in it to having $21 million and $5,000 in it." But everybody else is living in little apartments. Now you fast-forward, they've had -- they've built multiple, and they've not only built, but also invested in multiple multibillion-dollar companies. A lot of these people have multiple billion-dollar net worths. But in the book, they didn't. And so that line, these are the now "big players" when they were just trying to figure it out. And it's just another fantastic line that gives you an idea of what this book is about. Several PayPal alumni observed that they had spent the rest of their careers seeking a team of comparable intensity, intellect and initiative.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then it gives us a little bit about the prehistory to PayPal. It says, the PayPal we know today resulted from the fusion of 2 companies. Confinity was founded in 1998 by 2 unknowns, Max Levchin and Peter Thiel. Fresh off his sale of his first start-up, Elon Musk had founded X.com. He still owns that domain to this day, actually, a company that helped users e-mail money. So they start -- the history of PayPal is, they started out as competitors and then they eventually merged. This was a contest that raised the competitive ire of both teams and ended in a merger. For the next several years, the company survival was an open question. They were sued, defrauded, copied, mocked from the outset. From the outset, PayPal was a start-up under siege. Its founders took on multibillion-dollar financial firms, a critical press and skeptical public, hostile regulators and even foreign fraudsters. In the space -- this is why I tell you the stories in this book are just wild. It's incredible. In the space of just 4 years, the company survived the bursting of the dot-com bubble. I think I have a line later on, but in case I don't, it really struck me, it's like, so you have -- they started the company before the internet bubble burst, right? But they said something like three quarters, like 75% of their growth happened after, post-crash, which I thought was wild. In the space of just 4 years, the company survived the bursting of the dot-com bubble, 3 investigations by state attorney generals and a copycat built by one of its own investors. Many of its founders and early employees joined the company in their 20s. Most were fresh out of college. Working at PayPal was their first taste of the professional world. And that's why you'll hear them -- when you hear them speak now, right, they talk about, and they talk about it in the book as well. It's like, they purposely hired for inexperience. They hired for -- they prioritized intelligence and enthusiasm. They were not trying to recruit heavily from banks or other financial institutions because they didn't want people to come in and say, "Oh, this is how we did it there. So this is how we should do it here." That sounds very counterintuitive.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But I would say, it's extremely common in the history of entrepreneurship. Henry Ford writes about this at length. And he was talking about, "Listen, we're inventing a new way to mass-produce cars. If you're doing something new, you cannot go and recruit experts." He says -- let me quote from his autobiography, and these are words he wrote over 100 years ago, "That is the way with wise people. They are so wise and practical that they always know down to a dot just why something cannot be done. They always know the limitation. That is why I never employ an expert in full bloom." This is a crazy sentence that Henry Ford is about to tell us. "If I ever wanted to kill opposition by unfair means, I would endow the opposition with experts. They would have so much good advice that I could be sure that they would do little work." And so I'm not sure if the founders of PayPal knew Henry Ford's words. I do know because Elon has talked about Henry Ford quite a bit, about studying Henry Ford, reading about him. I just don't know if he did it when he was this age. So he says, "Its earliest hires included high school dropouts, ace chess players, and puzzle champions, often chosen because of their eccentricities and peculiarities, not in spite of them." Again, another very common theme. I got 3 quotes for you. One is from David Ogilvy's writing. He says, "Talent is most likely to be found among nonconformists, dissenters, and rebels." That is a great way to describe the early PayPal team. This is Walter Isaacson writing in Benjamin Franklin's biography about Benjamin Franklin's family and how that influenced him. And this is what he says, "The family produced dissenters and nonconformists who were willing to defy authority. They were clever craftsmen and inventive blacksmiths with a love of learning. Avid readers and writers, they had deep convictions." And then this comes from the biography of the founder of FedEx, Fred Smith. And it talks about Fred and then his executive team at the very beginning. He says, "They were all mavericks, nonconformists, courageous and crazy." And we see a small example of that here. It says a wall in the engineering office area included 2 banners.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

One was titled The World Domination Index. There's an entire chapter named that. It says The World Domination Index was the total count of PayPal's users that day. The other was a banner bearing the words, Memento Mori, Latin for, "Remember that you will die." PayPal's oddball team was out to dominate the world or die trying. And then I really like this observation by Elon here. So it says, Musk would later correct an interviewer who offered that PayPal was a hard company to create. "The company wasn't hard to create at all," he said. "Rather, it was a hard company to keep alive." And then Jimmy talks about -- the author talks about the fact that he's interviewing a ton of employees. He worked on this book for 5 years. And there's just a line here, it's funny that I underlined this at the very beginning. I'm still in the introduction ,and now I have read -- the book is 400 -- the version of the copy I have. I don't know what it will be when it's released. It's 414 pages. And this is a great way to think about this. And it's just so -- these stories are really important to read and to really absorb just because it talks about the true nature of business and this crazy endeavor that we choose to dedicate our lives to. And it's not clean-cut. It's not cookie-cutter. Like it is a dangerous environment. The way entrepreneurs represent themselves in like an interview is not the way they really are. And that's natural. That's anybody who like is going to present their best version of themselves to the public, right? But it says, many remember that the company was as cutthroat as it was creative, and it was unforgivingly intense. When you read a book about the lives of somebody that accomplished a lot or the early story of -- like the early days of a company, the extremes are on display. And those can both be negative and positive. This is a positive like in the aftermath because these people are being interviewed many years later, and this is where one of the early employees said, "I felt like I was part of something grand." And something that Jimmy does, it's really smart, he compares it to other historical collections of talent.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So let me go into that a little bit here because I thought this was an interesting idea, and I want to compare it to something I learned from this interview I watched a long time ago with Steve Jobs. So he said, I began to wonder about other -- so he's talking about -- so first, let me give you some background before I jump into this. He's talking about when he was doing all the research on the Claude Shannon biography that you realize that where Claude was working at the time, at Bell Laboratories, you had this insane collection of talent. And this insane collection of talent is extremely rare. And so he's like, these are the special -- like when you have an example like that, you should study them and see what lessons you can learn from that. So he says, I began to wonder about other Bell-like constellations of talent, including tech companies like PayPal, General Magic and Fairchild Semiconductor. And so there's this British musician. His last name is Eno. And he winds up -- Jimmy discovers that he had studied this previously, and he was trying to figure it out from like an artistic perspective. And he says, as he looked into these revolutionaries, including people like Picasso and Rembrandt, he discovered them to be products of very fertile scenes involving lots and lots of people. Some of them artists, some of them collectors, some of them curators, thinkers, theorists, all sorts of people who created a kind of ecology of talents. And so he calls this Scenius. So think of the word genius, but put S-C on the front. Scenius, he said, is the intelligence of a whole, an operation or a group of people. It is also a useful way -- now Jimmy's talking about his takeaway from that. It's useful when you think about the PayPal story, properly understood as a narrative about the lives, intersections and intersections of several hundred individuals set at a moment in time when the consumer internet took shape. Many of their achievements emerged from the productive friction of the group. At PayPal, disharmony produced discovery. And so that's going into just how many fights -- and remember, these are friends. And in case -- in many cases, they went to college together. They're friends of friends. Like that's how they started out hiring. It's just like friends, and then we'd hire, "Okay, you got a friend like you? Okay, let's see if they got friends like them."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I think Peter, later on, says something that's like, "We just started like expanding on these concentric circles," if I'm not mistaken if he said that. But this idea of like, "We're going to fight and argue and get in positions of discomfort to make sure that we're actually solving this problem or getting to the right answer." Steve Jobs made this observation a few years before PayPal was even founded. I have notes on, it's called Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview. And according to this, I took those notes back in 2019. I want to read something for you. And this is Steve talking. I'll leave the note -- I'll leave the link in the show notes, too. So it says -- well, this is my note. It says this is a metaphor for teams working on a product that they are passionate about, okay? So here's Steve. There was an 80-year-old man that lived on my street. One day, he showed me a dusty old rock tumbler. We took regular old, ugly rocks and some liquid and powder and put them in the tumbler. He said to come back tomorrow. The next day, we opened the can. We took out these amazingly beautiful, polished rocks, the same common stones that had gone in, through rubbing against each other, creating a little friction, creating a little noise, had come out these beautiful, polished rocks. It is through a group of incredibly talented people bumping against each other, working together. They polish each other. They polish the ideas. And so that idea now looking back, what Steve is saying with the benefit of having read this book, that line really sticks out. It is through a group of incredibly talented people bumping against each other, working together that they polish each other. They polish the ideas. And then there's another great line here why I think this book is worthy of study. "Properly understood, PayPal's story is a 4-year odyssey of near failure followed by near failure." So I want to go to Max Levchin. He's the CTO and co-founder of PayPal. He's going to -- he might be the most -- if you consider that his work wound up solving him and his team, wound up solving the huge fraud issue that came very close to killing PayPal, he might be one -- he might be the most important person in the story.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But in his early life, he's growing up in Soviet Russian or Russia, rather, or the Soviet Union, whatever you want to call it. And he -- they don't have a lot of money. He discovers computers, and he just completely falls in love. And there's actually a lesson here. So he says, "The notion that you could tell a machine to do things in the future was this profound realization," he said. "From now on, I don't have to know everything to get stuff done. I can just start writing it down, and it will happen on its own later." So he gets access to a computer. He's severely limited on how much time he can spend on a computer. This is in the 1980s. I think around 1986 or somewhere in there. And so he has to start programming with pen and paper or pencil and paper rather. And this wound up -- and he says, this wound up being good. So he says, "To preserve his precious computer time, he devised a system, writing code with a pencil and paper." This learning process left exacting standards. As he's talking about, he says, "Obviously, I'd rather program on a computer, but I don't have that option, so I'm going to do it this way. I'll do whatever it takes." And here is his punch line. "This made me very tenacious. I never really had the option to take the easy way out." And then Max talks here about the importance of his grandmother. She was a physicist. She was an extremely strong woman, and he learns from her. And it's like, it's not acceptable to give up. So he says, "She was fortitude personified, a woman who triumphed in a male-dominated field." Her grit seemed to him almost supernatural. "I had this living example of someone who would never surrender under any circumstances." So they wind up having to flee because they're worried that his father is going to be disappeared by the KGB. And so they wind up immigrating to United States. And there's 2 things here that a gift can change a young person's life. So if we have the ability to play this role in other people's lives, we should do so and that you should treat life as a quest, which is fantastic. Immigrating to the United States was risky. But for Levchin, who had just turned 16, it was the first step on an epic quest. The language and cultures were new, but one thing remained, Levchin's love for all things computers. And in America, he finally got to use one at his leisure. It was a gift from a relative, and it did something his old machines didn't. It would connect to the internet.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Levchin soon became consumed by the worldwide web and found networks and forums full of kindred digital spirits. And then there's some people that remember what Max was like in high school, and we're going to see that PayPal was an entire company full of people like this. He showed early signs of his hallmark intensity. He wanted to be the best at everything he did. So then Max makes it to MIT. And I just want to pull up something because I always think it's interesting when -- like they're recommending when other people recommend, okay, you've got to read this book, you've got to watch this movie, it had a huge effect on me. And he uses this movie that he's going to watch over 100 times as a metaphor for start-ups. And so he says, "He became obsessed with Seven Samurai. I thought it was the best movie ever. I watched Seven Samurai at least 25 times during the course of one summer, and I've now watched it over 100 times." He calls it his sole source of management training. So I went to go look to see -- I was Googling it. I was like, okay, where can I find this movie? It's on HBO Max right now. I started watching it. I watched like the first hour of it last night. And then I also found him describing -- I think this is in -- yes, this is in Tim Ferriss' book, Tribe of Mentors. And so Max says, "I don't have a book to recommend, but a movie. I've watched the Classic Seven Samurai more than 100 times. I used to give copies to young CEOs that I mentored. I love the movie, but I recommend it to new managers and CEOs, especially because it's fundamentally about leadership. It is a small band that risks everything to organize a ragtag group in a fight for its life. Does that sound familiar? To me, this timeless story is a near-perfect metaphor for start-ups." And then he says really quickly, and if you think about it, this is what exactly what we're doing. I just listened to this fantastic interview with Marc Andreessen recently. Somebody brought it to my attention. Joseph, who's been a longtime subscriber and constantly sends me great information to use for the podcast. He's like, "Listen to this interview, listen to the last 10 minutes of it, and it sounds exactly what you're doing with Founders."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And it's Marc talking about like -- Marc is famous for reading hundreds of -- like he just read essentially every biography that I've ever come across. And he talks about why he does this, and he's like, "You build mental models of these people, so like I have a little version of the people I read about." And he's talking on his shoulder. Some of those people he winds up knowing in person. And so he's -- when he's presented with his decision, he's like, "Okay, knowing what I know about this person's way of thinking, what would this person say in this situation? What decision would they make?" And then he said something that's fantastic. And he said, "Developing this base of knowledge is a way to stress-test your ideas." And so if you think about what you and I are doing here, it's like, we're building up this gigantic base of knowledge with the history of entrepreneurship, and then we can stress-test the ideas in our day-to-day lives and our working professional lives about what we know against the history of entrepreneurship, right? And so Max drew us an interesting parallel here because he's like, "Listen, I watched this movie 100 times." And it's a perfect metaphor for start-ups. And the main character, his -- I think his last name is Shimada. So he's like, "What would Shimada do?" So I understand how this guy thinks. I've studied how he thinks. Now I'm presented with a difficult decision. I'm running it through my own calculus of like what I would do, but to enhance that he's like, let me ask what would Shimada do in this situation. That is genius. So then we get to this chapter about Peter Thiel in the early days, like the prehistory of meeting up with Max. There's something that somebody says here that I've seen before as well. And so before this, I guess, Peter had set up like a hedge fund. It's called Thiel Capital. And it says, he was interviewing somebody, and he says, "Howery", his name is Howery, that was the last name, "returned to his dorm and said to his girlfriend, Peter might be the smartest person I've met in my 4 years at Stanford. I think I might work for him for the rest of my life." It was very interesting because if you read Ben Horowitz' book, The Hard Thing About Hard Things, in that book, he meets -- I'm pretty sure Marc Andreessen was like 22 at the time. But it says, "After the interview, I phoned my brother and told him that I just interviewed with Marc Andreessen. And I thought he might be the smartest person I'd ever met."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So we see a very similar experience that Howery is having with Peter Thiel that Ben had with Marc. So they wind up, they're all together at Stanford. And I think this echoes what Jimmy and -- was saying at the very beginning. Like you try to place yourself in these -- like these physical locations around people that are really smart and into what you're into. And so they wind up meeting up. There are all these people that are -- I mean, there's like 50 different characters in this book. And so 4 of them are meeting up and having a meal together and just sharing like all their thoughts and just bouncing ideas after each other. And so it's Peter Thiel and 3 other guys. And it says, the 4 met at a local fast-casual chain. They referred to these gatherings as the Billionaires' Breakfast Club. The level of self-belief they have is amazing. We all believe that the others were going to build big things. Oh, and this is 1998, mind you. Over meals, they discuss the latest developments in technology, philosophy, education start-ups and their predictions for the future. And so one of them is this guy named Luke Nosek, who winds up saying, "Hey, I want to start my own company. Peter, you're interested in start-up investing. Will you make an investment?" They're going to work together for a long time. So it says, just about everything was wrong with it. So Luke has this idea for like a smart calendar app. And the reason I'm pulling this up is because if you listen to Peter speak or you read his book, he talks about, over and over again, "Do not build. If you want to capture lasting value, you can't build undifferentiated commodity businesses." He puts like a cheek, like a pithy maxim on this. He says, "Competition is for losers." So again, I think that's him being -- a way to hook that idea in your brain. And this may be an influence where he learns from this. So he says -- or he learned this. "Just about everything was wrong with this idea," Thiel later said. It was a saturated e-calendar space that had like 200 companies that were competing for dominance. Thiel would later cite his smart calendar investment as a rich vein of learning, a failure whose lessons included minimizing competition that would pave the way for PayPal's success.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then I think this is also an example of the importance of just putting your ideas out there even if really no one is listening or no one is showing up. Thiel is giving all these lectures. I think this is at Stanford. They're at Stanford. Yes, it's in Stanford's engineering center. And Max just didn't know who Peter was. I think he was like a friend of a friend maybe. And so Max just pops into this lecture. And again, this is, what if Peter said, "Oh, you know what, I'm not going to -- maybe I don't have any ideas." Like there's a level of self-belief you have to have to think that people want to hear what you have to say, right? So what if he never did this, well, then there's no PayPal. And what if there's no PayPal, like there may be no -- the very -- like think about all the companies that came out of the wealth that was generated from this one company, Tesla, SpaceX. Elon's going to wind up being the largest shareholder because he's crazy. And there's many examples of that in the book. And he comes out with $180 million once eBay buys it or maybe after the IPO. I'm not sure exactly when he sold. But regardless, he comes out of this environment with $180 million, and he immediately puts $100 million into SpaceX, $70 million into Tesla. Again, these things are just so important. So if you have something to say, you have ideas, like just even if no one's showing up. Max is coming -- I'm not being clear here. Max is coming to a lecture that Peter is giving, and there's like 5 people there, 6. It's just not a lot of people. So it says, small crowd notwithstanding, Thiel's talking to impress Levchin. "Wow, if I ever do anything in the financial world," Levchin thought, "That's the dude I want to hang with." This is obviously not a computer scientist, but he is a nerd. After the lecture finished, Levchin hung around to try to bend Thiel's ear. So remember that tweet I was quoting from. It's like, listen, they were just young hustlers trying to figure it out. They wind up launching their initial ideas to do like PayPal, like -- not PayPal, an application for PalmPilots at the time. This is really the prehistory of PayPal. I'm going to read it to you and then I'll explain to you. The effort arguably represented PayPal's earliest iteration. The company now boasted an angel investor with a closet office.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So that's Thiel. Remember, the guy who probably has, I don't know, $10 billion or $20 billion, whatever it is now. He starts this company in a broom closet. Essentially, that's all that was available. A CTO, without air conditioning, that's Max, and he's coming from Soviet. Actually, no, he was just coming from MIT, sorry. Comes from MIT to California, and he's got this tiny little apartment without air conditioning. And a CEO with a 2,100-mile commute, this is this older guy named Powers who is commuting on the weekends. So he's got a job. I think he's in Chicago. And he's got to fly in on Friday night, work and then come back on the early morning Monday and go back to work. And so again, this is the prehistory of PayPal. You've got a company with an angel investor working out of a broom closet, a CTO with an apartment -- a tiny apartment and no air conditioning and a part-time CEO that has to commute 2,100 miles. And then it talks about the important relationship that Max had -- Max and Peter had together. And it says, founders have to have somebody they can actually trust. There are so many people who are good at being good to you when things are great. But when s_*_ is not really working, who do you objectively talk to? Levchin and Thiel had each other. They burned so brightly and so differently. They're one of the best examples of a great partnership. And so the note I left myself on that page was, Charlie said the same thing. And I think this is a really important point that they're picking up on the relationship between Peter and Max and what Charlie realized in his very long career. And Charlie said, "Everybody engaged in complicated work needs colleagues. Just the discipline of having to put your thoughts in order with somebody else is a very useful thing." So if you read the biography of Elon Musk, you know that something he did was, he would read the newspaper and he'd just cold-call people that he thought were smart and interesting and tried to get them to meet with him. He winds up meeting this guy that's an executive at Nova -- or excuse me, Scotiabank. And I just want to give you a description. He winds up becoming a friend and a mentor to Elon, and his name is Nicholson. And I'm just giving you a real quick, like his impression of meeting Elon when Elon was 19 years old.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he says, "He was very, very bright. He was very curious, and he was already a very, very big-picture thinker." And so it was through this internship that Nicholson gets Musk at the bank where Musk just has this like, "These people are morons. If I ever have to compete, like I would not be worried about competing against bankers." He says, if -- this is Elon looking back at this time. "If they're this bad at innovation, then any company that enters the financial space should not fear that the banks will crush them because the banks do not innovate," Musk said. And so there's a couple of highlights here that are just really interesting. It's Elon on not needing business school, on the importance of studying physics, on reading and then the importance of asking the right questions. And so he is a dual major. He's studying physics and finance. And so he says, "If he redid his studies -- if he had to redo his studies, he admitted he might have ditched the business classes altogether." Musk's passion for physics predated college. "I had an existential crisis when I was 12 or 13," he later said. "And I was trying to figure out, what does this all mean? Meaning of life. Why are we here? Is this all meaningless?" In the midst of that crisis, Musk discovered a science fiction novel that offered hope. It was Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. And so he talks about the stuff like this actually soothes him. This is interesting because I've had this own realization. Like I really feel -- I'll tell you in a minute. He learns -- so he's talking about what he's learning. In the book, he learns of an old species of hyperintelligent beings who had constructed a computer called the Deep Thought to seek answers to the ultimate question to life, the universe, and everything. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy soothed Musk's existential worries by suggesting that framing the right questions was as important as divining the answer. "A lot of times," Musk explained, "The question is harder than the answer. And if you can properly phrase the question, then the answer is the easy part." And so it's interesting that he was soothed by reading this book.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I really feel if you read a lot of biographies and you read, especially of people that have already died, my own experience, that's the same word I would use, it's like weirdly soothing that you see life is going to play out, death is undefeated. It's not something you can avoid, so let's get to it. Let's build. Let's have a quest, treat life as a grand adventure. To Musk, physics asked the right questions. He started to read the work of Dr. Richard Feynman. I've read like 3 of Feynman's books, including his autobiography. I'll probably throw that on the podcast at some point. The internships exposed Musk to the world of technology start-ups, and he found people who, like him, labored around the clock, relished video games, and would solve math puzzles for fun. And then it goes into the behavior, and we see like Musk -- like what Musk was like in his early 20s, moves out to California, starts his own company. This is Zip2. He -- this is when he starts as, "I just work. I wake up. I open my eyes. I work until I fall asleep." I live in -- he literally lived in the office. He would shower at the YMCA. So I'm going to fast-forward through some of the history, but it says, Zip2 grew throughout late 1996 and 1997, wanting to be like a technology company that powers media companies essentially. So they get investment from Knight Ridder, SoftBank, Hearst, Pulitzer Publishing, and other companies, and The New York Times actually. Only 2 years into its existence, the company powered sections of 140 different newspapers. Their growth came at a price, though. Musk clashed with his investors and fellow executives who raised questions about his leadership. He was impatient and perpetually sleep-deprived. He was prone to setting unreasonable deadlines, chewing out other executives and colleagues in the open, and retooling code written by other people without asking first. And so he knows he's running a company like a maniac. He says, later on, he said, "Listen, this is the first time I run everything. I didn't even play team sports like I never managed people." His aggressiveness and all those traits, I think he still possesses to this day, but he says that he's better at dealing with other people. This was -- I'm going to fast-forward so we can get to PayPal. It all came to a conclusion early the following year. Zip2 sold to Compaq for $307 million in cash.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

For Musk, that purchase meant a $21 million payday. To this day, that moment astonishes him. "My bank account went from $5,000 to $21 million and $5,000," he said. He was 27 years old. And then you're going to see, he does something -- like when he starts X.com, he just throws a bunch of his own money into it. He doesn't even try to raise investments. We see this over and over again. He eventually raised money in the future and, I think, in every endeavor, but this idea, and he's like, why would -- like he's full risk-on. Like why would you do that? And part of the reason is because he has this great insight about the internet. And so it says, the business types treated the internet as a 20th-century gold rush. Musk saw it differently. "I thought it was something that would fundamentally change the world. It was like a nervous system for the world that could potentially make humanity somewhat of a superorganism." So then he starts X.com, and here are some people that are working with him. And really, I'm bringing this to your attention, like this is the impressions they had of Elon in 1999. "He's one of the greatest salesmen I've ever met. He's like a Steve Jobs. When he articulates something, he tends to find the kernel that will appeal to a broad mass of people intuitively." And that we're still in 1999. An early employee goes to Elon's apartment. And this is what he says, "He was very high energy, very much, let's go. Let's get something going and do something, build something. Let's achieve something." He walked into Musk's bedroom. The room was literally filled with books, biographies about business luminaries and how they succeeded. It kind of clicked to me that Elon was prepping himself and studying to be a famous entrepreneur. It's funny because that's what my bedroom looks like now. I've long since run out of shelf space. So then Musk talks about fixing a mistake that he made with his first start-up, and he's got a really important insight about marketing.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And it's just one human communicating to another, do not overcomplicate it. Musk had outsourced the renaming of Global Link, that is one of Zip2's products, and regretted it. "I had deferred brand and marketing and whatever to people I thought were domain experts," Musk said. "And then discovered subsequently that you just have to use common sense. And that's actually a better guide." And then we see this risk-on attitude that he continues, I mean, for the rest of his companies, right? Musk rolled much of his Zip2 windfall into X.com, investing $12.5 million and purchasing the X.com domain with his personal funds. "At the time, I thought, he's nuts. Honestly, he's nuts." Indeed, staking so much of one's net worth on a new start-up was noteworthy in large part because Musk didn't have to. And so they made the point at this time when he's trying to raise money for X.com or when he's investing his money for X.com. It was a very friendly environment to people who were raising money for internet companies. And it's somebody that just had a successful exit of $300 million could raise money easily. He did not have to do this, which was interesting to me is the signal. I didn't even think about this. Like this other effect that it could have. The signal it made to other people that he was trying to recruit because he's saying, "Listen, they're throwing around -- everybody is throwing around money." It's very hard to recruit engineers. I need the best talent. And so he says, this wind-up, the fact that he put so much of like his skin in the game, people would choose him. If the 2 offers were equal, it's like, I'm going with the guy that actually put money behind it because he clearly believes in it. Musk's personal investment made for a winning recruitment pitch. I'd make a phone call for recruiting or whatever and say, "Oh, he's got $13 million of his own money in it." This was a very -- this was an example of a high-profile founder betting his fortune on the company. So I want to stay here for a second because this is Elon post-Zip2, but pre-PayPal, right? We're in the X.com. His mentor hooks him up with this guy Fricker, who is also used to running his own thing. So this guy is not going to last very long. But there's just a lot of valuable insights on these 2 pages, a bunch of double underlines and, "Damn, that's good," in the little notes that I left on this.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, Elon was very good at pointing to the future just as he is today and saying, "The objective is over there, and I know it's over there. So we should all go over there." Vision weighed as much as data. There's a reason why entrepreneurs who succeed in technology get paid as well as they do. It's because it's not a straight line. It's not a straight line between I build a factory and the widgets come out and the widgets get sold. Musk had learned -- this is one of the parts where I underlined twice. Musk had learned that start-up success wasn't just about dreaming up the right ideas as much as discovering and then rapidly discarding the wrong ones. And so listen to what Elon says because this is like an extremely interesting perspective. You start off with an idea, and that idea is mostly wrong. And then you adapt that idea and keep refining it, and then you listen to criticism. And then you engage in a sort of recursive self-improvement. Keep iterating on a loop that says -- this is so perfect. Keep iterating on a loop that says, "Am I doing something useful for other people?" Because that is what a company is supposed to do. Too much precision in early plans, he believed, cut that iterative loop prematurely. And so this is just like one -- the first example of dozens in the book where you have people within a company fighting with each other. And it says, some coworkers found the conflict confusing. This is between Musk and Fricker. Others were less surprised. Musk and Fricker had both run the show in prior roles. Power sharing wasn't a particular strength for either of them. And what's crazy about how tumultuous and just how messy this whole process is, PayPal is messy. The stuff that happened before PayPal is messy. There's 4 cofounders of X.com. Three out of the 4 leave before the PayPal merger. And so Fricker sends an e-mail to Musk, and he's just like, "Are you not like all-in on this?"

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so it says, Musk responded, but rejected Fricker's premise that he was asleep at the wheel. And so this gives you an insight into just how crazy he is. And this is Musk writing to Fricker, "I think you may have misread me a little. My mind is always on X by default. Even in my sleep, I am by nature obsessive-compulsive. What matters to me is winning and not in a small way." And that line right there, "What matters to me is winning," is the name of this entire chapter. And something came to mind as I'm reading this book, and it really comes to mind when I'm reading. There's just not very many non-obsessed people that we talk about, right? They are by nature obsessive. But this idea is like, "You misread me. My mind is always on X by default. Even in my sleep. I am by nature obsessive-compulsive, and what matters to me is winning." I had this highlighted. I saw on YouTube, and it's about highly successful people are usually insane. And there was a quote in there I wrote down. And really, this quote popped to my mind because there's a bunch of people like this in this book. And it says, "You think the people who run things are just sitting at home smoking big cigars. That's not true. I know lots of people like that. They work all the time, all the time, from the second they wake up until the second they go to sleep. And they don't just casually work. These people who are running things, the vast majority of them, first, are self-made. And second," this is really the punch line, "They are so bloody efficient and smart, you cannot believe it. And they work 80 hours." Before I finish this other punchline, I thought it was interesting in this sort of clip. That is something I cannot tell you how many times I put down this book and said, damn, that's smart. Damn, I can't believe they came up with this idea. They are so bloody -- at the very top, right? So I had this idea, and I don't have a good way to explain it to you. I think I mentioned to you before, but I think on the macro level, this is the way I have it in my mind, and I got to figure out how to explain it better. But like on the macro level, I think people vastly overestimate the level of competition. Most people are not thinking about starting companies, even a large percentage of people that do think about starting it never do. Then you have a smaller percentage that do start companies, and you just don't have to worry about those people at all.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then the further down you get on the line, the more micro you get, then you vastly underestimate the competition. And so when I hear this person saying, "They are so bloody efficient and smart, you cannot believe it." I think of it like Jeff Bezos pops to mind, highly intelligent, highly driven and highly ruthless and fully committed every hour of the day. Go back and read their biographies. Go back and read the early history of their companies. They're not lollygagging. They're not taking days off. They're insane. And so it says that people who are running things, the vast majority of them, first, are self-made, and second, they are so bloody efficient and smart, you cannot believe it, and they work 80 hours a week. There is a small number of insane people who will do nothing but work 80 hours a week no matter where you put them. If you put them in the middle of a forest with an axe, all they would do is run around chopping trees and so on. I'm reading this old e-mail by a late 20 -- he's 27, 28 years old when he's writing this e-mail. He's like, "I think about this in my sleep. All I care about is winning." And I think it's just so hard to understand the variance between a person like that and like an average Joe or Jane. They're almost like a different species. I want to get to this. It's really interesting because a large influence of what they were trying, like -- at least on the PayPal, like the Peter Thiel and Max Levchin side, they were very interested in creating like their own currency, like their own -- almost like their own version of their own little sovereign nation. So their initial idea, which I'm going to skip over -- there's a lot more detail, and you've got to obviously read the book. I mean, I can easily recommend this to anybody building a company. There's just too much valuable information here. In fact, you can buy this stuff for like $25. It's crazy. But the initial idea is that they're going to beam money using PalmPilots. Max is steadying up on cryptography, and that's like a huge part of the initial product of -- at this point, the company is called Confinity. And so they go to a conference, and it's interesting because Peter Thiel is convinced that the Bitcoin creator was actually at this conference.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, in 1999, Levchin attended the International Financial Cryptography Association Conference hosted in Anguilla. The annual gathering drew the leading players in academic cryptography and digital currencies. To this day, Thiel who attended the 2000 conference harbors a theory that Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious founder of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin was among the attendees. To the assemblage of financial crypto experts, Thiel and Levchin came off as arrogant uninformed outsiders unaware of the decade of wasted effort before their arrival on the scene. And so what they're talking about is that they're trying to raise money for their start-up and it's unbelievably difficult because of what they're choosing to do. I'm going to finish this, but the reason I'm bringing this to your attention is, this is just a reminder, it's supposed to be hard. It took Jeff Bezos 50 meetings to raise $1 million. He talks about that in speeches and wherever he goes, he's like, "I was in 50 meetings just to raise $1 million." The most common question at these meetings was, what is the internet? That's crazy to think of. That's a $1 trillion company now. It couldn't even -- it took 50 meetings to raise $1 million. Venture capitalists who run through this during what Thiel called an excruciating process. The team presented over 100 times with pitch after pitch falling flat. As rejections piled up, the team grew desperate. And so many times, reality is stranger than fiction. This is such a coincidence. These 2 companies are going to wind up at different starting points and then wind up at the same emphasis, which is this idea they wind up pivoting to, both companies, Confinity and X.com, the idea, that you should e-mail money. And they wind up being neighbors. Confinity and X.com occupied adjoining office suites in Palo Alto. It started as a mere coincidence. X.com and Confinity were neither competitors nor collaborators. Confinity pursued mobile money transfer and cryptography, while X.com went about building its financial services superstar. So you think about the way to describe what Elon's idea was, like the Amazon of financial services. Each company thought the other was misguided.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Despite divergent approaches to financial technology, the company's CEO shared -- the companies' CEOs shared an obsession, getting noticed. Just as Musk courted media attention for X.com, Peter made generating headlines a top priority. In this environment, Peter sees a lot of excess. The lesson here is, it's a good question to ask yourself before spending company money, will this improve our product and help us achieve our mission? As the internet boom began, start-up excesses flooded the Bay Area, expensive team retreats, parties and limitless alcohol and pricey billboards. None of it, Thiel and Levchin thought, credibly advanced a given company's products or mission. They would not use the millions that they had raised for such excesses. So then you talk about, okay, how the hell do you recruit very talented people? You're not going to pay them a lot. And so Levchin just has a lot of good advice. You have to define undiscovered talent, and you have to give them something more than money. You cannot compete with the large companies on money. And so it says, to win recruits over, the team crafted an edgy sales pitch. So Levchin is going to describe this. He says, engineers are very cynical people. They're trained to be, and they can afford to be given the large number of companies that are trying to recruit them in Silicon Valley. Since engineers think any new idea is dumb, they will tend to think that your new idea is dumb. And they get paid a lot at Google. So he's describing this years after PayPal, okay? So he says, why would they stop doing that to do your dumb thing? So the way -- and this is where he's going to get to his advice. So the way to compete against the giants is not with money. Google will outbid you. They have -- this is such an interesting way to think about Google at the time. They have an oil derrick that splits out $30 billion a year. To win, you need to tell a story about COGS. At Google, you're a COG, whereas with me, you're an instrumental piece of this great thing that we'll build together. Articulate the vision. Don't even try to compete on pay. Meet people's cash flow needs. Pay them so they can cover their rent and go out. It's not about cash. It is about breaking through the wall of cynicism. It is about making 1% of this new thing way more exciting than a couple hundred grand in a cubicle at Google.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then this might be -- this is one of the most important ideas in the entire book because PayPal -- the early days of PayPal -- I'm just going to call it PayPal, even though it's X and Confinity at the time. You know where this is going, okay? PayPal prioritized speed on everything, over everything else except in one category, recruiting. They would rather staff slowly than compromise on quality. And what Levchin says here is fantastic, okay? So it says, Levchin kept the bar high for talent or kept the talent -- kept the bar for talent exceedingly high even if that came at the expense of speedy staffing. And this is what it says, Max kept repeating, "A players hire A players, B players hire C players." So the first B player you hire takes the entire company down. And so they found a way to limit the chance that a B player is going to slip in there. Additionally, PayPal's leaders mandated that all prospects meet with every single member of the team. And then we get our first introduction to David Sacks. David Sacks winds up becoming a major -- he's a huge character in this book. I mean, he's all over this book. Peter had to overrule everybody else to bring him in because Sacks thought the idea is like, "You're beaming PalmPilot; this was stupid. No one has PalmPilots." You have -- he's like, "You have the product, and you bury the product on your home page." He's like, "The product is sending money through an e-mail dress." So it's not in full chronological order here. They're going back and forth, but I want to give you an idea, like the energy of the company would convince recruits to join and take a chance. And they're just on it 24/7. There is no -- like we said earlier, it's a small group of insane people. Sacks invited Lee to visit the office at 10 p.m., and given the hour, she expected to stop by and then move on.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But a short meet and greet was not to be. "It was a full-on interview," she recalled. "They were interviewing people at 10 p.m., which I was not prepared for." By the time she left at 2 a.m., she had spoken to nearly every employee. And then she winds up accepting because she says, "I can't really put words on it because I go by my gut. But the energy there, I hadn't felt that before, and I'm like there's something here." There's another -- this person's name is Denise. And so she came to meet the team. "I left the interview not being able to tell you anything exactly about the product or much else other than those -- these are the people that I want to work with. They're clearly hypercompetitive." She's emphasizing these words. These are her emphasis, not mine. "Clearly hypercompetitive, clearly workaholics, clearly want to change the world. I was just like, "Wow, I found my people." So now they recruit another person that you're going to know who is. This is the future founder of LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman. And this is fantastic because this idea that Paul Graham has popularized that at the very beginning of your company, you need to do things that don't scale. And you learn information -- valuable information when you're doing that. And he says like, in his observation of all these great companies, they all did things that don't scale at the very beginning. And in this case, doing things that don't scale lead to a breakthrough. And so this is what Reid says, "We're living in the heaven of PalmPilots, and we would walk into every single restaurant and go to each table." So they'd go -- they're in Palo Alto. They're like, this is the center of tech. If -- the highest percentage of people adopting this new device, and they don't even have it. What are we doing here? So he says, "We're living in the heaven of PalmPilots, and we would walk into every single restaurant, and then we'd go to each table and ask how many people have PalmPilots." The answer was between zero and one per restaurant. And that means that your use case can only be used between zero and one times. You're hosed. It is over on this idea. Levchin -- so he talks about this idea of, what happens if you need to complete a transaction, you forget your PalmPilot. And so they stumble on this idea -- their main idea by trying to fix a problem that -- for a product they're not even going to continue to build. Levchin proposed a workaround, suggesting that PayPal's website could be set up to send money via a user's e-mail address.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

When -- and this is the crazy part. When e-mailing money -- remember the entire foundation of their company. When e-mailing money was first suggested, few recognized it as a eureka moment. And then looking back, it seems we were, too, because they're like, listen, the e-mail money demo dramatically simplified this sequence, which is, I am one person trying to pay another. You can pull up the PalmPilots, use the infrared, and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Oh, you don't have PalmPilots, you can do this. It's like, everybody has an e-mail address. So again, the way to think about this is, is there something that you're not working on that could be like a more simple version of what you're doing? The e-mail money demo dramatically simplified the sequence. Within weeks, Levchin had become an avid user of the afterthought product even as he remained committed to the vision of the original. And he looks back, he's like, "I didn't understand how stupid I was being at that point." He says, "That should have been a clue. I have become an avid user of an afterthought product, but I'm still committed to the vision of the original that I'm not really using." And then think about this, go back to that idea that we had learned -- we just learned from Elon where he's like, "You need to keep yourself in this recursive loop of self-improvement. And the loop, this iterative loop is just keep asking, am I doing something useful for other people?" Because that is the entire foundation of a company. And if you apply Elon's thought process to what Max is experiencing here, it's like, yes, I'm doing something useful because I'm using it all the time. This e-mail product is great, and I'm not using what I'm focused on. And to me, that's another really important point of like studying these early -- like the early days of their lives because you see the mistakes and the struggles of smart, driven people. So back to the books, it says another person who severely doubted the money beaming's viability was a recent hire who would play a pivotal role in the company's success, David Sacks. Thiel and Sacks had attended Stanford together. Sacks didn't pass the aura test. Remember, this idea of like everybody has to meet them. So this is an early -- they don't name the person who said this. This is an early team member. The team objected in part to Sack's total dismissal of the PalmPilot product.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"It was a dumb idea. There were 2 problems," Sacks remembered. "One is, there's only 5 million Palm users. So unless you're with somebody who also had a PalmPilot, the app is useless. And then there's the other problem. Even if you're with somebody who's got a PalmPilot, what would you use it for? Nobody could really come up with anything other than splitting dinner tabs." And so I always think about what de Gaulle said. He said that when he was so weak, intransigence was his only weapon. And there's just an example after example of Sacks being intransigent in this book. In hiring David Sacks, Thiel pulled rank and overruled the team's objections. This was a rare move for Thiel who believed Sacks is a rare candidate. After all, few people would come into an interview, guns blazing against their prospective employer's flagship product. Thiel valued bracing honesty, and he trusted that Sacks would speak candidly. So it's another example. They just -- they're not running away. Go back to Steve Jobs' rock tumbler story. He's like, "Don't run from disagreement. Run towards it." So while that's happening at PayPal or Confinity, whatever you want to call it, we got to go back to X.com. We're still in 1999. So no, they haven't linked up yet. This is the late summer of '99. This is crazy, what I'm about to read to you. So I'm going to read to you -- first, let me tell you why I think it's crazy. So in late summer of 1999, Elon Musk's X.com was a pale shadow of the digital finance behemoth he envisioned. X.com had no finished products and a hollowed-out team. The employee directory now contained a mere 5 names. Missing were the company's founding president and COO, the CTO and VP of Product Development, the CFO, the Principal Architect and the VP of Corporate Development. Why is that crazy? Because 3 years later, Elon Musk will make $180 million from this broken situation that he currently finds myself in. So even though Musk has a large amount of his own money in the business, he decides to raise money. And so he winds up meeting with Michael Moritz at Sequoia Capital. Michael Moritz has a very interesting life story. He wrote that book that I did back in like Founders, maybe, 76 or something in there. It's The Little Kingdom. It's like -- it's about Apple. It's like the first -- he was at the time -- I think he was a reporter for Time Magazine at that point if it's correct. I can't exactly remember.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But he winds up writing that book. It's like the first 5 or 7 years. It's like a snapshot of the first 5 or 7 years of the history of Apple, which is very fascinating. It winds up getting into venture, winds up becoming a billionaire. So it says, "Moritz cut an unconventional figure in Silicon Valley. He was an Oxford graduate with a Welsh accent. He was a former Time Magazine journalist with limited technical background, but his years of reporting honed his instinct for talent and ambition. In one famous deal, he secured a 25% stake in Yahoo! for $1 million back when its -- Yahoo!'s founders were still working in a trailer." And so Moritz is going to invest in Elon, and he says something that is really interesting that Elon remembers. He says -- this is August 1999. And he says, "Moritz was like, dude, you should not have basically everything you own except your house and your car and a company," Musk remembered. And then Moritz makes a good point. He's like, "If I knew what was about to happen, we might not have done it." Had Moritz and Sequoia known precisely what they were signing up for, he'd wondered if they had signed up for all -- at all rather. "I think we waded into it perhaps the same way that Elon and then Peter and Max waded into it, with a level of ignorance." So now he's fine, and interestingly, if you think about the traits they had back then that they still have now, there's just some memo leaked where Elon just -- I think it was in SpaceX if I'm not mistaken. He was apoplectic on the use of acronyms. He wants simple language. So you see this at this point, they're hiring some older people, and they call them gray hairs. I don't even think they're that old. It's just everybody else is like their early to mid-20s. Another of the gray hairs who joined shortly after was Sandeep Lal. His interview with Musk was memorable. "I remember that I used the words change management," and Musk said, "Stop using b**_*_** words." And then we see an example of Musk leaning from the front. I just read that book. It's on the first 6 years history of SpaceX called Liftoff. It's also in the archive if you want to check it out. And we see that he -- what they're about to say -- what his employees at X.com are about to say about him here, they say the exact same thing, decade and a half later, maybe like a decade later, SpaceX -- maybe less than that.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So anyways, it says, we slept under desks. Even Elon slept under his desk. He didn't pull himself away from that sort of thing. The engineers recall their CEO working elbow to elbow with them doing knotty technical challenges. Most CEOs are not very transparent with their staff. Elon was like, "Listen, we're in the trenches together. Let's do this." It was powerful to work with him because of that. And this is an interesting sentence if you think about this business is going to be sold for $1.6 billion 3 years later. We didn't even have an -- I didn't have an office or a desk. I had a chair and a milk crate. So there's several coups in the book. There's a coup at X.com of trying to get rid of Musk, which was not going to happen. There's a coup to get rid of the original CEO of PayPal when they joined together. Then there's another coup to get rid of Musk that's successful, and then Peter Thiel takes over. But this first coup just happened or just attempted to happen. And really, I'm reading this section to you because one of my favorite ideas that I've ever read comes from Derek Sivers, and I'll leave a link in the show notes for the -- I've read the entire thing on past podcasts before, but it's this idea that there's no speed limit and that the standard pace is for chumps. And we'll see how fast they move here. It was the summer of 1999, and X.com's banking heavyweights had tried to oust Musk as CEO, and then they fled. The "company" was essentially a mysterious URL, some loyal holdouts, Musk's dwindling capital and an idea. Four months later -- this is what I mean about, there's no speed limit in life, right? You can go as fast as possible. It was wild to me. I just talked about this to somebody on the phone yesterday, was that -- because they have like several outlines in the book of like progress later on, PayPal goes from 1,000 paying customers to 10 million in less than 2 years. So it says, 4 years -- or excuse me, 4 months later, that episode was ancient history. So all this happens in the next 4 months. In the intervening period, X.com earned funding from a top-flight venture firm, that's Sequoia, built a functional product, grew its engineering and management benches and signed agreements with banks at home and abroad. As ever, Musk wanted faster, more thoroughly dazzling results. There is no speed limit. The standard pace is for chumps.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So there's a series of like disasters in the press for both companies and when they joined together. And there's just weird things that humans haven't figured out that especially in the age of the internet, if you dislike something, in many cases, talking about it can actually help it. It's like you should starve it of attention, right? You think of attention as the oxygen for that. Something -- and so like a variation of this idea is the idea that -- it's the Streisand effect. It's like when you have an attempt to hide, remove or censor information, it has the unintended consequence of increasing awareness of that information. And so you get all the negative press about this event that happens at X.com, and this is the result. The extensive coverage, although it was negative, left X.com with more sign-ups than before the negative headlines. And so in parallel, Elon and X.com are going to realize, like there's just so many regulatory barriers. Like he wanted literally, you sign in X.com, and every single thing, your bank account is there, your investments are there. Like it is your home for money. It is the Amazon of money, right? And then they wind up in the interim figuring out, hey, we can tie people, so instead of having account numbers, we'll have -- your account will be your e-mail address, and you can send money that way. And he comes to a realization where Elon was like, this is -- this didn't make sense because it would seem so stupid and trivial to me. And so he says, it was trivial to do a money transfer. It's like super dumb. My kid has made one. And he's 12. He's saying, it's just literally, you have an SQL database, and you're just moving it to another row in the database, right? He says, they initially thought of it as a user acquisition engine, not as the end product. And so there's another early X.com employee. She even stayed with PayPal for a while. Her name is Amy Klement. She recalled that the X.com team thought that the person-to-person payment product is simply a user acquisition engine. It wasn't the core business. That was the online financial superstore. Indeed, Musk was frustrated that X.com's other products didn't generate the same excitement.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"We would show people the hard part, the agglomeration of financial services," this is Musk speaking. "And nobody was interested. Then we'd show them the e-mail payments, which was the easy part, and everybody was interested." And so what Musk was saying there about this is super frustrating, this is really hard, I want to show it off, and yet you're interested in this thing that was super easy for me to do. There's a quote I keep on my phone I was thinking about. And it says, "People pay you according to how valuable they find your work, not how hard you find it, basic fact of life, many don't understand." And then there's also -- like during this section, Musk picks up on another interesting insight. And really what I thought about is like, "Oh, this is an interesting insight, take something that already exists and marry it to a fast-growing technology." What they did, and this is why it was also confusing and why it was so impactful. So he says, "It wasn't even that we invented money transfer. We just made it useful," Musk said. "Other companies had the idea of doing payments before Confinity or X.com. They just didn't do it right." And so is it possible? Can you take something that already exists and then marry it to a fast-growing technology? A lot of people have e-mail in the late '90s, but it's also growing rapidly. And you compare and contrast to their other ideas, like well, there's 5,000 PalmPilots. And what are we doing here? We can't build a big business off that. So at this point in the story, David Sacks is in control of the product at Confinity. And I'm going to compare this to something I learned about Steve Jobs that's really interesting. He soon discovered that product management was as much about avoiding distractions as producing breakthroughs. "As I took over product in the company," Sacks remembered, "I kind of became like Dr. No because I'd always have to say no to everyone's stupid ideas. It was really important that we not squander our precious engineering bandwidth on ideas that didn't make sense for the long-term strategy of the company." So that idea, that's a variation of obviously Steve Jobs' idea that focus is saying no. So Sacks became zealot. He's got a really important idea here. He's like, "Make your product as easy as e-mail is fantastic." Sacks became a zealot for efficiency within Confinity and simplicity without, a zealot for efficiency within the confines of the company and then simplicity without the company. So on the outside of the company.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

When he saw, for instance, that the early iteration of the PayPal's sign-up process -- so I don't want to confuse you. PayPal was the product name. Before Confinity is the company, PayPal is the product name they came up with. Eventually Confinity and X.com are going to merge. It's going to be called X.com, and the product will be called PayPal. Eventually, they're like, "Hey, the f**_*_** name of the company should be PayPal." Okay. So it says, when he saw, for instance, that an early iteration of the PayPal sign-up process forced new users through 7 web pages, he was horrified. On the office whiteboard, he outlined a new single sign-up page form. And after getting approval from Thiel and Levchin, Sacks marched all the engineers in and said, "Build this." Sacks was like, "I do not understand why this is so complicated. It should be as easy as e-mail." And then they started taking that saying and putting it on the company's walls. "As easy as e-mail," graced the office walls. So I did a bonus episode on that book, Insanely Simple: The Obsession that Drives Apple's Success. It's in the archive if you want to see it. And so there's a story in the book where these people are getting ready. They have all this demonstration ready. They're about to meet with Steve. They go through all this work. They're waiting for him to show up. He walks in, and this is what happened. Mike was shocked when Steve Jobs walked into the room, ignored their work, and walked right up to the whiteboard. "Here's the new application," he said. "It's got one window. You drag your video into that window, then you click the button that says burn. That's it. That's what we're going to make." And then he walked out the room. And so this is really interesting. The takeaway here is like you need to read e-mails from your customers. And so Steve Jobs is known for responding to e-mail. Jeff Bezos was known for responding to e-mail from customers. I say it's like a variation of what the founder of UPS realized. It's like you're getting filtered information for your executives, and you get it unfiltered from your customers or your front -- the people who work in your front line.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So that's why Jim Casey, the founder of UPS, would always -- whenever he saw a UPS truck, he'd pull over and he'd talk to the driver. He's like, because this guy is going to -- he knows like he's the interaction with the customer. He's going to tell me straight as opposed to what I'm getting through my executives. And so they wind up realizing, "Hey, people are adapting our product in ways we didn't understand." And that was really important because eBay becomes the entire -- like that's the platform they build their future success on. And so Sacks recalled the precise moment the team discovered PayPal's use on eBay. An eBay user had e-mailed Confinity customer service seeking permission to use the PayPal logo on the auction page. She also wanted the team's help resizing the logo. The team wondered if the logo resizing ask was a one-off request or if there might be more people like her. Luke Nosek, Chad Hurley -- Chad Hurley is going to be one of the founders of YouTube, and David Sacks huddled together and searched ebay.com for the term PayPal. Thousands of auction listings popped into view. "It was one of these holy s*** moments," Sacks said. And then there's just a bunch of like these great one-lines because these people are just -- the amount of lived experience they have is just incredible. And so this idea from -- this one-liner from Reid Hoffman I thought was great to give you an idea of the story in the book. He says, "The cadence of learning at a start-up, f**_*_* intense is an understatement." So there's a bunch of other companies that are flush with cash around this time. We're in '99, 2000 era. And so they almost sell the company too early. And there's a bunch of examples like this. And so one of these companies had -- I think they had IPO-ed and had a bunch of money and this company, I don't even know. It's called Be Free. It had just gone public like a few months earlier, then soared like 700%. And so they're like, "Oh, let's buy your company." And they would have sold the company. Peter was -- this is Confinity. This is before PayPal. Peter said, "Hey, you can have the company. Just give me $100 million." And they said no.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then another great one-liner, they're talking about how they hate -- they abhor bureaucracies. And so Musk makes an observation about Peter. So it says, "Peter is even less tolerant of b**__* than I am," the famously administrative-adverse Musk remarked. "My b__*** tolerance is low, but Peter's is like zero." And so there's a whole thing in the book where Peter is like, "I don't want to be CEO." He did it like reluctantly. Then they go public. He's like, "I really don't want to be a public CEO company." He kept trying to get out of this thing that he was in. He's just like does not want to do this. He was much more interested in markets and money than managing people. He's like, "I don't want any of this." And I think about what the founder of the Four Seasons said. Like it's good to know who you are as a person when following natural drift because he says, "What we really want to do is usually what we do best." So then we get to the part of the story where they both -- both teams independently have arrived at the same product. And so now they're going to have to compete head-to-head, which is going to lead to their eventual merger. So it says, as Musk followed the Confinity team's machinations, he began to respect the team's ingenuity. "I thought, 'Well, these guys are pretty damn smart.'" He concluded that X.com would have to do everything it could to win on eBay. To Musk, defeating Confinity and eBay would likely incapacitate it elsewhere. Thus began one of the more ferocious and unusual battles in internet history. X.com and Confinity launched a weeks-long war to win customers on eBay. It was -- and they're talking about -- so this is widely known, but in case you don't happen to know it, both companies are paying sign-up bonuses. So you get $10 to sign up. And then if you try to send money to somebody else, they get $10 to sign up as well. And these number -- $10 is what -- it changes over time. Sometimes it's $20, sometimes it's $5, but $10 is the one I think they got the most growth out of. So it says, thus began one of the most ferocious and unusual battles in internet history. X.com and Confinity launched a weeklong war to win customers on eBay. "It was kind of a race to see who could run out of money the fastest," Musk said.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then we see the extremeness. Somebody had a birthday. So it says, Confinity team brought out a cake with the words, "Die X.com," written in frosting. Musk sent a memorable X.com-wide e-mail with an innocuous subject, "A friendly note about our competitors." The message body contained a single line, "Kill them dead. Die, die, die." In Levchin and Thiel, Musk found something he rarely encountered, competitors as driven to win as he was. And then Peter reflects about this point where they're competing. It was incredibly exciting and incredibly scary. And then we get into more of Peter's perspective on this. Earlier than many of his colleagues, Thiel saw X.com as an existential threat. "Peter likes to confront things. He likes to know if he's wrong. He's actively looking on how things could break, how could things fail constantly, much more so and much more proactively than a lot of entrepreneurs that I know." Peter was determined that X.com could simply spend Confinity out of existence. Peter was good to recognize that they were a real threat. And Peter did not like to lose. "Show me a good loser," he once said, "And I'll show you a loser." So they eventually arrive at that conclusion. And keep in mind, I'm skipping over massive parts. There is so much detail. Think about this. The book is 414 pages long. It only covers 4-year history. The entire PayPal adventure lasts just 4 years. So there's a ton of detail in the book. This is interesting, though, they have -- they realized they have to merge and the differing opinions. So it says, Levchin grew to respect Musk. "I really like this Elon guy," Levchin remembered thinking. "He's obviously completely crazy, but he's really, really smart. And I really like smart people." Mike Moritz says, "This is fantastic. It's going to be a merger for the ages." Elon, though, Elon Musk saw the acquisition as a surrender in a winnable war.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then a few pages later, this is just wild. And how did this wind up working out is the question here. Anyone looking at the merger could have been forgiven for forecasting doom. X.com's founders, Elon Musk was opposed to it. Confinity's lead investor was skeptical of it. Confinity's CTO, Max Levchin, had called it off once before. And X.com's CEO, Bill Harris, had put himself permanently on the outs with Musk in order to make the merger happen. So then from here, they have this 2-year sprint to solve all the problems, to make sure that the company can survive. It's an echo back to what Elon said, "The company was easy to start, almost impossible to keep alive." I'm just going to give you a list of some problems that they have that just must be solved. More users meant more complaints. The companies face additional scrutiny from government regulators. The Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Secret Service grew concerned over illegal transactions. The 2 companies had distinct user bases and distinct websites. And they had built their services on different development platforms, one on Microsoft and one on Linux. Basic questions like what to call the company's core product remained unanswered. The merger also hadn't solved a fundamental problem. The new entity's combined burn rate. The joint company was on track to spend almost $25 million that quarter alone. And there's a funny quote from Reid Hoffman here, "If we were standing on the roof of our building throwing wads of $100 bills over the side, we would have been spending money less quickly." Musk remembered the myriad crises colliding at the point of merger. "If the fraud thing is not solved, we're going to die. If customer service is not solved, we're going to die. If we don't have a revenue model, if our business consists of only cost and no revenue, we were going to die." And so then Peter also realizes, "Listen, we're in a huge bubble." And he's young. He's 32 years old when he's saying this stuff. And so he talks, and he's like, "We got to raise money right now." And it says, Peter wanted to close commitments quickly arising from his belief that the U.S. economy sat on the brink. I give the credit to Peter. He made the macro call. He said, "We have to close on this because the end is near." I wouldn't call it raising money, and he talks about like how you have a sign of a bubble. I wouldn't cause it -- I don't know if this isn't Peter saying -- this is another investor. "I wouldn't call it raising money when it's like, 'Okay, of all the various people trying to smash down the door and give us money, who should we accept?'" Oh, this is -- I'm sorry, this is Elon talking about this time. "I wouldn't call it raising money when it was like, 'Okay, of all the various people trying to smash the door down and give us money, who should we accept?'" Musk recalled. "We were getting fire-hosed with cash," Peter remembered being cornered seemingly everywhere he went.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The crazy nature of it all confirmed Peter's suspicions about the market. I remember thinking to myself that it felt like things couldn't get much crazier. And that we had to close the money quickly because the window might not last forever. "Peter kicked everyone's a_* to get that funding run done," David Sachs remembered. Musk too anticipated into impending downturn. And he talks about all the c_** companies at that time. He says people need to do their homework and not blindly buy into companies that aren't well put together. "There's a lot of Potemkin villages out there built on flimsy foundations, and many will fall." That is it from a speech that Musk gave in mid-1999. Musk said, "And for young people who've never really seen a serious recession, anyone who studied history knows that they happen and that a downturn is a rough experience." The timing was auspicious. Just days after they closed its round, U.S. public markets entered a downward slide that would ultimately wipe out $2.5 trillion in market cap and sour the mood on technology stocks. And then this is crazy. I think I feel like everything I'm saying, like starting at every section, so this is crazy because it is. This is how important that one decision proved to be to act with urgency, to think, okay, there's a huge change. We got to get this money in now. And because there's a bunch of competitors that didn't have -- weren't able to do that. Back then, there were 5 to 7 other online money-moving services that just got starved of oxygen over time. They all died out by the fall. So they didn't have the money and there goes half, not even half, almost all your competition. If we hadn't raised that $100 million round, there would be no PayPal. There would be no SpaceX, no LinkedIn and no Tesla. There's a fantastic story about their customer service issues. It goes on quite a bit in the book. I want to give you the punchline here though. So they go from a backlog of -- there's one guy in customer service, and he grabs David Sachs. He's like, we have 100,000 unread customer service e-mails. And Dave was like, you could have told me this before you got to 100,000.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so they go from a backlog of 100,000 customer complaints to 0 in a matter of months. And they put an employee in charge of this with the last name of Anderson. She just has a fantastic idea. So her original idea is, they want to staff a call center to do customer service that goes through the complaints faster. Her original idea is, okay, she's from the Midwest. She's like, "I can go to Omaha, and I can teach my extended family to do customer service from home. This is like the year 2000. And then she trains them, then they hire their friends. And then they go out and they just keep recruiting people. And so they go -- and that's a very simple idea, a very smart idea on how they go from a backlog of 100,000 customer complaints to down to 0. And then later on, this winds up being extremely important because later on, eBay has their own like payment service that they are trying to prioritize and one of the complaints from eBay power sellers is that PayPal's customer service is just so much better. And another crazy thing is like, you can have an idea and then 20 years later -- so they staff this call center in Omaha. And it says, to this day, PayPal remains one of the region's largest employers. So an idea comes from just one employee saying, "Hey, how can we solve this problem? Let me think on my toes." And 20 years later, you're providing employment for a large swath of people. And this is the takeaway. Years later, Anderson reflected on her scrappy approach to solving customer service for the company. I never stopped and thought, will this work? That question was completely foreign in those years. It was, what can we do and how fast can we do it? And then this is an interesting idea. Elon believes that you have to tolerate failures as a side effect of iteration and says, I remember once Elon saying one thing, which was like, if you can't tell me the 4 ways you f_*_ something up before you got it right, you probably weren't the right person who worked on it. Musk echoed this sentiment. If there were 2 paths where we had to choose one thing or another, and one wasn't obviously better than the other, then rather than spend a lot of time trying to figure out which one was slightly better, we would just pick one and do it. And sometimes we'd be wrong. But oftentimes, it's better to just pick a path and do it rather than facilitate endlessly on the choice. And then I think this book is a perfect illustration of the founder Atari, Steve Jobs' mentor, a guy who hired a 19-year-old Steve Jobs was this guy named Nolan Bushnell. He wrote a book called finding the next Steve Jobs, which I read and is also in the archive.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so Peter leaves. He is eventually going to come back, but he leaves. So he says, "Musk believed that whippersnappers like Peter, who's loss troubled Musk stood the best chance of innovating and winning." And so in Peter's absence, Musk gets to know David Sachs. And they had a lot of similarities. They were both immigrants from South America -- from South Africa, and this is the important part. They both brought an intensity and energy to their work. And so they're going to kick this Harris guy out, and this is another coup, and they're going to put Elon in there. And really the lesson here is, you've got to live and die by the founder. Right or wrong, the episode cemented the team's allergy to executive experience. This belief would emerge as a start-up truism later, but at the time, the team since defied received wisdom, standard operating procedure at the time saw Boards installing a seasoned CEO to steer dot-coms once they've found their footing. X.com's leaders took Bill Harris' rocky tenure as evidence that such supervision was not only unnecessary, but counterproductive. "We saw what had happened at Apple when they brought in the Pepsi executive," David Sachs said. "We saw what happened in Netscape when they brought in Jim Barksdale and then Musk makes just a fantastic observation of why you have to live and die by the founder. And he says, "The founder may be bizarre and erratic, but this is a creative force, and they should run the company. If someone is to create a force or one of the creative force is behind the company, at least they understand which direction to go in."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Maybe they don't run the ship perfectly. The ship may be a little erratic and morale may be mixed, and some parts of the ship aren't working as well. But it's going in the right direction. And so he said -- he compares this to Steve Jobs as well. He says, "Musk admired Steve Jobs and had studied the period of his departure from Apple." The ship was sailing really well, Musk observed, in the interim years between Jobs' departure and return, sailing really well towards the reef. In May 2000, just shy of his 29th birthday, Elon Musk retook the title of CEO. So the idea that Musk and Sacks have at this time is like, we need to reorganize back into small teams of smart people. They change towards semi-independent teams, which would lead to more rapid iteration. Both Musk and Sacks had observed an irksome start-up paradox. As a start-up grows in size, it began to accomplish less work of substance. They were far from the first to identify this paradox. In 1975, Dr. Frederick Brooks explored this conundrum in his software engineering Bible, The Mythical Man-Month. So we're going to quote from this book now. "When scheduled slippage is recognized, the natural and traditional response is to add manpower. Like dowsing a fire with gasoline, this makes matters worse, much worse. More fire requires more gasoline and thus begins a regenerative cycle, which ends in disaster. More programmers assigned to a given project," Brooks explained, "Multiplied the number of communication channels." This is the really interesting idea. So they multiplied the number of communication channels. The time spent talking whether keeping the team members up to speed or building interpersonal relationships was time not spent coding. Two heads in other words were not necessarily better than one. Sacks decided to build small self-contained units. Sacks and Musk believed small units freed innovators from the entanglements of bureaucracy. And then this is fantastic. We see the future founder of Yelp talk about the early culture that is emerging here. In the view of X.com's leaders, growing organizations often make a crucial mistake. Employee happiness becomes a bigger concern than output. To avoid this, company leaders set a cultural tone of impatience. So I recently had coffee with a founder and investor who listens to the podcast, this guy named Seth. And he said something about this founder that he knows. And when he said it, I was like hold on, I got to write that down. Sorry, I'm stealing that line. And he says, "The founder is intolerant of -- completely intolerant of slowness, be intolerant of slowness." I thought that was fantastic. So it says, the company's leaders set a cultural tone impatience. They may -- and they would make decisions by Fiat when necessary. It was not an open democracy of ideas, we call Jeremy Stoppelman. Company leaders set a cultural tone of impatience, be intolerant of slowness. And so I have notes in my book -- in this book. I might buy another copy and literally just highlight and underline just the tactics and the solutions that they come up with for some problems. Like the story is fascinating. The narrative that Jimmy builds is fantastic. Getting to know the people when they were younger is fantastic.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

There's like dual -- there's so many reasons to read the book. And one of them, it just becomes -- like you're going to see, okay, they have a problem. This is a unique solution they come up with. And it's just like understanding not -- you're not copying the what, you're understanding the how behind it, right? And so one of the problems they have is, they're getting killed because like they're transferring money. But if you're doing it on credit cards, they're paying percentages coming and going. And so it was like, okay, well, if we're getting killed in transaction costs, how can we find a solution? And so one of them is like, well, let's see if we can encourage them to keep balances in their PayPal account and then we can just transfer from internally, which costs nothing. If enough customers kept money on their accounts, the team realized that the company could transfer dollars between users at no cost. "Their internal transaction cost is like a milli-cent," Musk explain. It's basically $0, and that is why you want to maintain balances. This process also produced some counterintuitive insights. For example, Musk insisted that the company continue distributing debit cards and even checks. If you're forced in order to conduct your life to move money out of PayPal, right? So I have money in PayPal. I sold on eBay. But now I've got to pay a bill. I don't have a check on this account, so I'll move it out. He's like, "I don't want you guys to do that." So it says, if you're forced in order to conduct your life to move money out of PayPal, he observed, you move money out of PayPal. So if you -- but if you have to write checks -- so if you have to write checks and PayPal won't let you write checks from your PayPal account, you're going to move money at your checking account. And then he says, "Commenting on the modern PayPal's lack of checks," this may be a laugh, "Musk became impassionate about the subject anew. So give them the goddam checks, sweet baby Jesus what is wrong with you people?" Another great one-liner, important insight for you. David Sacks has brought something to their attention when they're building up this product. And he said, "Every moment of friction for the customer was fat to be cut."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So there's a huge internal fight about Musk wanting to rewrite the entire PayPal product. He wanted it written from Linux into Microsoft. There were also some other issues with company direction. He's a very young CEO at that time. And so there's another coup, and they're wind up kicking him out. It says, "So began the clandestine effort to cut Musk, the cofounder and CEO and biggest individual shareholder out of the company." And so some -- this winds up happening, they wind up being successful. This is where Peter is going to come in and run -- be the CEO up until they sell it to eBay and then he'll leave, everybody else leaves. But during this whole time, really what's remarkable is Musk's response to this. And so he gets an e-mail from some supporters -- internal supporters and this was his response, "Thanks, folks. The whole thing is making me so sad that words fail me. I have given every last ounce of effort, almost all my cash from zip2, and my marriage is on the rocks, and yet I stand accused of bad deeds to which I have not even been given the opportunity to respond." And I think the key takeaway here is just the way Elon -- like I'm really impressed the way Elon responded. So it says, "Musk didn't even seek retribution." Jeremy Stoppelman was an early Musk recruit and he reached out to Elon in an immediate aftermath to ask if he and others should show their support by threatening to resign in mass. Musk instructed him to stand down. Even Musk's long-serving allies within the company were thrown off by his moderation. Musk's position was born of realism. "While I didn't agree with their conclusion," Musk said, "I understood why they took the action they did." Peter and Max and David and the other guys are smart people with generally good motivations, and they did what they thought was right for the right reasons, except the reasons weren't valid in my opinion. Musk references the biblical story of judgment of Solomon, where they're both saying, who is the mother of the baby? And they say, okay, they can't agree. So the King says, okay, split the baby in half, which then leads the first woman to immediately relinquish her claim for the sake of the child's life, and then that means the King's -- this is a story in the Bible, which -- and then the King says, "Give the first woman the living child and by no means, kill him because she is obviously the mother." And so he -- Musk says, "I view the company at least partly my baby. His voice tinged with emotion. If I attack the company and the people there, it's like I would be attacking my baby. I don't want to do that."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then Jeremy talks about revisiting this difficult time many years later. There's another smart move by them here. They just -- they let the past stay there is the note I left myself. A few chose to remain mom because of genuine misgivings about how they asked to be placed. Still, others simply believe that long-buried hatches should remain so. They're very smart. Leave the past where it is. And then 2 decades later, Musk had mustered a bit of grudgingly respect for the revolt. "It was a well-executed coup," he said, "smiling." It's slightly complementary that they can only do it when I'm not there. So they did it when he was on like a joint honeymoon and fundraising trip, and they planned the meeting for the -- for when his plane took off. And then there's a memorable line in the book of the biography written by Ashlee Vance on Elon talks about the level of pain tolerance that this guy had in terms of like, in 2008, both SpaceX and Tesla were near bankruptcy. And so this is an example of that. We see this even when he was younger, founding a payment service start-up amide dot-com bust represented a spring of hope and a winter of despair. Few experienced those fluctuations more viscerally than Elon Musk. From 1999 to 2002, Musk netted a fortune from the sale of his first start-up, launched another successful internet company, minted a second fortune when the company went public, and launched a third venture. During those same years, he fought off one mutant against him, nearly perished in a car crash, was ousted as the CEO of the company he co-founded,, almost died again due to a combination of malaria and meningitis and lost an infant son to sudden infant death syndrome. And this is all in 3 years. He decided once he was ousted at PayPal. He wasted no time. He already knew what he was going to do. And he says, "The new ventures from Musk began briskly. There was no time to lick wounds and nurse grievances."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Just months after the coup, Mark Woolard took Musk out for drinks. I asked him what he was going to do next, and he said, "I'm going to colonize Mars." This is in 2002, mind you. "I'm going to colonize Mars. My mission in life is to make mankind a multi-planetary civilization." And I'm like, "Dude, you're bananas." So now Peter is in charge. Peter's main thing -- again, he's not optimizing for experience. He would bet that -- he just wanted to hire really smart people and he would bet that they figured it out. We saw Ed Catmull, founder of Pixar, who said the same thing. He said, "You can give a mediocre team -- mediocre idea to a smart team, and they'll throw it away and figure out something new." So it says, Peter was both an example and a proponent of putting talented neophytes in charge. Early on, Peter appointed Reid Hoffman, as CEO, cutting against his Board members' advice. He installed Sacks as VP of Strategy, despite concerns about Sacks congeniality. He promoted a fresh out of business school, Roelof Botha to CFO and put a young attorney named Rebecca Eisenberg as the first legal Chair on the IPO. Later talk of Peter's contrarianism would focus on his decision in markets and politics. But during the PayPal years, his tendency to buck convention had nothing to do with math or political philosophy. It had to do with people. He didn't give a s_*_. He cared about smart people who worked hard. So there's an entire chapter called Igor. It is about Max and his team, solving the -- they were losing 10s of -- like a $10 million a month or something like that, just on fraud. And if they could not solve this problem, like it's over for them. And so there's -- again, there is more detail in the book.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But really, I want -- there's just like 2 -- 3 paragraphs here. And I wrote fascinating, what business are we actually in? And the whole time, I'm thinking I'm reading a book on a payment company. He's like, "No, that's not the business that we're in. That's not the innovation that PayPal achieved in Max's perspective." And so he says, "With these evolutions, PayPal effectively reinvented itself as one of the first big data security companies. PayPal is actually more or less a commodity business," Levchin observed. It sounds very cool and innovative making money on the internet -- or excuse me, moving money on the internet, but the credit card interfaces have existed for 20 years. All we really did was put a very pretty web front on it and let people use their e-mail addresses as a set of their accounting number. "But beneath the surface," Levchin said, "PayPal's core innovation sparkled. So what business are we actually in? What is the value that we're adding?" This -- so this is Max talking now. "This emerged part of PayPal is the massive and very, very numerically driven risk management system, which allows us to instantaneously tell when you're moving money to someone else with a very high degree of certainty, whether the money you're moving is yours or whether you got it illegally and you might be on the hook later or we might be on the hook later to help authorities investigate or retrieve the money." Even PayPal's millions of dollars in bad transactions -- this is now the author wrapping up the main point here, which is very fascinating. Even PayPal's millions of dollars in bad transactions could be justified for the extensive data set that they generated. Losing a lot of money to fraud was a necessary byproduct in gathering the data needed to understand the problem and build good predictive models. So I think Max's point is, anybody can move money, but can you move money and not be beset by fraud where it puts you out of business. We solved that problem and other companies did not. So another massive problem that they had to tangle with over and over again is platform risk. Now you have problems. You have problems with fraud, you have problems with customer service, you have problems with growth, you have problems internally. But now you've got a problem from eBay itself. And this is something that founders to this day still have to deal with, this risk when you're building upon someone else's platform. It says, once the PayPal team dove into the buy-it-now button mechanics, they started to panic. So eBay, before, there was no -- so the crazy thing is, years before eBay existed, there was no way to -- they didn't have a payment system at all. And in fact, at the very, very beginning, they trusted that if you use their auction system and you sold something, Pierre, the founder, he had this belief that people are generally good. So he's just like, I'll trust you to just mail in like my percentage of transactions. So he'd get a bunch of stuff in the mails with like $0.25 or $1 in it or whatever the case is. And then eventually, obviously, PayPal realized, it's like, "Hey, your customers, like why would you want to send checks?" Like if you're an eBay power seller, like I don't want to wait for a check.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Just -- like then I have to deal with, I have to wait for the check and do a deposit. I have to do all sorts of stuff. You just pay me with PayPal, it's like 10x better than a check. And so eventually, eBay realizes their mistake. They're like, "Oh, so they have Billpoint, they have all these other systems, but people are still electively -- their customers are still electively choosing to check out with PayPal because they thought the product was better and the customer service was better. So then they stopped going for a thing where it's just like, okay, you can do an auction. But what if you just want to say, I just want to buy this, I don't want to bid on it. So when they released buy-it-now, they made their own eBay payments the default setting. And so this is what the story I am about to tell you. But once the PayPal team dove into the buy-it-now button mechanics, they started to panic. In a traditional auction and eBay bidder would place a bid, receive an e-mail if they want and then choose a payment system. Because auction buyers left eBay mid-auction, PayPal had a chance to warm itself into the payment process. A winning bidder could go from their e-mail account to PayPal in order to pay a seller, thus completing the auction process without ever returning to ebay.com. Buy-it-now radically refigured this dynamic. If a buyer pressed the buy-it-now button, an eBay payments form would appear, allowing the buyer to complete the payment directly on ebay.com, thus knocking out PayPal, right? And so this is about their reaction to this platform risk. This change sent Peter and David Sacks into fits of anger. David and Peter would get totally historical and say things like, they can't do this. How dare they? And we're like, it's their platform. They can do whatever damn well they want. So then it talks about the relationships. They started building -- Reid Hoffman is put with the task of building a relationship on a back channel through eBay. This is what I mean about, they're just so bloody efficient and smart that you just cannot believe it.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

There's just tons of examples of these -- really like apart from the story, I would read it just to understand how they solved their problems and just think it's amazing. So they start having this back channel. They essentially began building a relationship. From eBay's perspective, like they're kind of annoying. They don't want -- they come to hate PayPal, but they have a grudgingly respect -- they grudgingly respect them. It says this guy that's building a relationship on eBay side with Hoffman on PayPal side. Chestnut began -- came to respect PayPal's team's aggressive growth efforts. They are definitely default aggressive. "They were very highly entrepreneurial, very aggressive. You've got to admire that," eBay's CEO, Meg Whitman said. "PayPal was a company of extremely aggressive people with a real bias for action," she concluded. "A company of extremely aggressive people with a bias for action." Now the only thing that saved them is the fact that they were a company focused on one thing going against a company focused on many. So eBay puts out this new buy-it-now with their own Billpoint, but the product sucks, and their execution is terrible. So it says, despite buy-it-now, the free promotion and other growth efforts, eBay's Billpoint gained only a marginal share of payments on the platform in late 2000 and early 2001. As Billpoint wound down its promotions, they were doing the same thing, it was like, "Oh, pay to open an account, basically copying what PayPal's growth strategy was.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

As they wound down its promotions, Billpoint's progress stalled and then reversed. PayPal's numerous counteroffensives helped it stave off Billpoint's encroachments and the 2 sides now continue to fight for ground. So again, you can copy what I'm doing, but I'm only focused on this, and you're focused on, it's one part of your gigantic business. We know how that's usually -- that the fight is usually going to end. So they're continuing to fight, and PayPal does it as another strategy. And the note I left myself here, PayPal uses everything to their advantage. And so now they're like, okay, you're putting defaults on your website in response to what we were doing, and other payment processors were doing. This is clearly antitrust. And why are they saying this because at the time, this is taking place in history, Microsoft is getting whacked. And so they're like -- and other technology companies are scared. So it says, "The Department of Justice and 20 state attorney generals had sued Microsoft for anticompetitive monopolistic behaviors." So it says, "The government threatened to break Microsoft up." The case sent a chill through the spine of technology leaders everywhere, including at eBay. PayPal leaders fomented their fears. Keith Rabois was tasked by Peter Thiel to build an antitrust paper trail against eBay. PayPal also built a political action committee to send contributions to members of Congress, then encourage those members to write notes to the Federal Trade Commission concerning eBay's monopoly power. The company also enlisted an outside counsel to issue a scathing note to eBay's headquarters. eBay is abusing its market power over the online marketplace to distort and eliminate competition for payment services in direct contradiction to United States versus Microsoft Corporation and they list, obviously, the case numbers and all that stuff. And just at this point, I'm 80% done with the book. And I'm just like, I would not want to compete with these guys. You can clearly see from eBay just like, okay, just name your price, just I want to buy you just to shut you up.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this is the World Domination chapter I mentioned earlier. This is when they started to expand. They had a World Domination Index, like I mentioned earlier, it's like how many PayPal users they have, but then they started to expand globally. And really, I'm just reading this quick paragraph to you because this is their MO, this is our modus operandi. The team chose to use its international expansion to pursue 2 major goals, growth and fundraising. It began this effort as it had begun much else over the prior years with little planning, quick action and faith in itself to iterate its way to success. So they eventually are going to file for their IPO. This is after the bubbles popped. People were like, this -- the press' reaction was like, this is stupid, don't buy this IPO, it's completely negative. I think today, what, PayPal is like a $300 billion company, something like that. But really the reason I'm reading this section is because everything they do is like this. Nothing is as it appears. They are masters at misdirection and just concealing what their actual intentions are. And so they're in the quiet period before their IPO or they're about to be, and they're like, okay, eBay hates us. eBay can come out and really like torpedo our IPO. They don't want this IPO because that means we're more likely to stick around, right? And so it's like, how do we stop them from talking s_*_ about us essentially. And so they come up with some machination. "We're going public, and all these people are going to call eBay," Reid Hoffman explain. And eBay's going to say, "Oh, we think PayPal is a house of cards. We're going to drive them off our platform as soon as possible. Public investors," Reid noted, "Had a reputation for risk aversion." If eBay poisoned the well with those investors, PayPal's stock issue could fail. With the quiet period of hovering, PayPal could say little to defend itself publicly. So Hoffman came up with another way of muzzling eBay, and this is what he said. "If eBay is in negotiations to buy us, if they say anything to the public market, it's breaking fiduciary responsibility," he realized.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

PayPal would then enter another round of acquisition negotiations with eBay to silence it. And they've had many failed talks up until this point. And again, so I'm going -- from eBay's perspective, like okay, these guys are back. We have a chance to buy them again. PayPal is not -- they're not going to -- that's not their goal here. Their stated goal is you shut up until this IPO happens. Hoffman approached eBay with the offer. So they said, "Okay, you can buy us for $1 billion. I think they would have taken $1 billion, by the way." And so -- and I think Reid says that. The eBay team came back with counteroffers, but Hoffman stood firm. Hoffman said, "I have a mandate to sell the company for $1 billion. I'm not trying to negotiate." And of course, every day of "not trying to negotiate" bought PayPal an additional day of eBay silence as its IPO marched to a close. These guys are just so bloody efficient and smart, you cannot believe it. eBay recognized that an acquisition of PayPal before the IPO might prove wise financially and came back with a final offer of $850 million. "If what you're telling me is that your last offer is $850 million," Hoffman said, "I can take it to the Board. But just to be really clear, I have a mandate to sell the company for $1 billion. If you gave me a $1 billion offer, you would own the company." eBay's CEO, Meg Whitman, grew frustrated at PayPal's unwillingness to yield. "I think she thought we were going to take the $850 million," Reid said. She didn't realize that my principal goal was to keep them quiet and not to sell the company. So the IPO winds up working out. They wind up raising a bunch of money. I think the evaluation was somewhere like, final settled like $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion, somewhere in there. I just want to read this to you because up until this point, we're almost at 400 pages into the book. It's just a struggle after struggle. We're going to die. We're going to die. We're going to die over and over again. And there's a guy named John Kothanek who is an employee at PayPal. And I want to read, there's a bunch of reflections on this day, but I thought his was the best. It's just a feeling of relief and satisfaction post-IPO. And so he says, "John remembered gazing across the crowd in the parking lot because everybody gathered as a company and seeing the parts that produced the whole. We weren't a big company still," he said.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And there's a couple of hundred people standing out there at most. And you could look at the people and you could say, I know what that guy did to get us to this moment. I know what that woman did to get us at this moment. I know what he and she and her and him did to get us here. And I was just so proud of everybody. The festivities had PayPal quirks though, with a celebration mixing with competition. The employees most vivid memory of the day was, Peter playing 10 simultaneous games of speed chess in the parking lot. Each game included a cash bet, a large crowd huddled as Peter played each board and moved to the next in rapid succession. During one stretch, Peter won 9 out of 10 games. Peter doesn't drink much, and we made him do a keg stand that day. And after that, he was half drunk, and he still beat 9 out of 10 people. It's crazy. David Sachs earned lifelong bragging rights for being the only player to beat Peter during the simultaneous chess match. When Peter lost, he was pissed. I just remember him getting up and clearly being screw-faced. He was livid, still competitive to the very end. This is more about the financial outcome for Elon and his default of being full risk-on. Far and away, the biggest personal windfall went to Elon Musk. Musk was historically the company's biggest individual shareholder and had acquired even more equity as time went on. Musk owned more PayPal stock than even institutional backers like Nokia Ventures and Sequoia Capital. And then this is, again, just another genius counterintuitive strategy that they had. The guerilla marketing is just amazing. So this is post-IPO. Another round of acquisition costs with eBay have -- talks with eBay, rather, has fallen out. And so eBay is having this gigantic company conference, right, inviting all the sellers on their platforms to calm and have this giant conference and the CEO is going to talk and everything else. And it's called eBay Live. And so PayPal was like, "All right, well, how do we remind eBay, how important we are to them?" And it says, the marketing team had procured thousands of T-shirts featuring the PayPal logo on the front and the phrase New World Currency on the back. They distributed them at the event with an incentive. Those seen sporting the shirts at eBay Live would be eligible to win $250 cash price. The goal was to remind eBay's senior leadership that PayPal was inextricably tied to its seller community. Even eBay's most vocal cheerleaders would wear PayPal swag.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

As eBay Live opened its doors, PayPal logos were everywhere with attendees wearing the shirts in hopes of winning free cash. eBay took notice. As Meg Whitman took to the conference stage for her keynote, she was greeted by thousands, a staggering number of PayPal T-shirts. And so why is this so important? Why are they playing these games? And this is a great way to think about risk. We were completely dependent on our enemy. Few on the PayPal team saw that risk dissipating without a deal between the 2 companies. Reid Hoffman had a pithy means of describing the challenge. "Just because someone shoots 5 bullets at you and misses does not preclude the sixth one from killing you," Keith Rabois said. And in the footnotes of this section, they're talking about this guy that's hired by eBay. And he tells a story, a great Steve Jobs story that I've never heard. And so I'm a sucker for these. I'm going to read this to you. I think this was around 1999. So it says, Steve Jobs had been hunting for CFO of Pixar and reached out to Jordan, who agreed to meet Jobs for breakfast. I showed up in my suit jacket Jordan recalled and Jobs walks in, in torn clothes 20 minutes late. Jobs only had 2 interview questions for Jordan. Question one, you went to Stanford Business School in the late '80s, and then you're in the center of the company creation universe in the most exciting time in the world, and you became a f_* management consultant. Question 2, how could you work at Disney for 8 years? Those guys are f_* bozos. What a job interview. Jordan saw the questions for what they were, a Steve Jobs stress test. "I'll cut to the first one," Jordan said. It took me 10 years to find my way back here, but I'm back here, and I'm here to stay. On the question of Disney, he pushed back hard. "You're wrong on Disney," he said. Then he explained because this guy is running, I should have clear, he's running Disney's retail stores. Then he explained that Disney stores had higher consumer ratings than Disney theme parks. Jobs seemed satisfied and pitched Jordan on Pixar. Jordan demurred. He had just been a CFO and he was looking for something different. Jobs proposed he joined Apple instead.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"I have this new vision for Apple stores," Jobs said. And proceeded to outline a reimagined shopping experience from the root up. Jordan thought that Steve Jobs was delusional and politely declined the offer. Of course, Jordan said, of Jobs retail concept, "He nailed it." And so as all these people from PayPal are giving interviews, they had reunions and everything else throughout the years. And one of them, one of their early employees, Branden Spikes said something that's really important. It's like, why the stories that you and I discussed on this podcast, like why these books and these stories are just so important to spread? Because they inspire people to make -- to do things with their lives and their work. A lot of these people, I sat next to in cubes, writing codes and building systems. And they went off to create some of the greatest companies that exist today. Getting back together with all these folks and hearing their stories was just so inspiring. Spikes felt moved to raise funds and to launch his own company. And then they reflect back on the fact that their inexperience was an asset. It says the idea that our motley crew of misfits could come together to build something out of nothing was really incredible. They also came to see inexperience as an asset. The best employees had little or no prior background building internet products. Had the company built its fraud process traditionally, they would have hired people who have been building logistic regression models for banks for 20 years, but never innovated and then fraud losses would have swallowed up the company.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Levchin added an unexpected qualification for PayPal's employees that he felt contributed to the company's success and the later achievement of its alumni. Many of its earliest employees simply hated being employees. The very best employee at any job at any level of responsibility is the person who generally believes that this is their last job working for someone. The next thing they'll do, they'll start on their own. And then they talk about the difficulty of now 20 years removed from this situation. They're no longer the people sleeping in the office, they're no longer people with empty bank accounts. They built companies that are massively successful. So what do you do? And I think what they're telling us here is like advice for us, like if you can give back to the next generation, you do whatever you can. The founders, especially in their capacity as investors have had to find ways of working around this challenge. So it's saying, you get a certain level of comfort, it's really hard to put everything on the line again and then appreciate the person who is putting it on the line. To that end, Levchin takes regular meetings with smaller student organizations at various colleges that he visits. Peter is known for taking sitdowns well outside of his immediate orbit, including the occasional high school student who reaches out with a compelling note. Reid Hoffman forces himself to regularly ask others, who is the most eccentric or unorthodox person you know? And how could I meet them? They might be crazy, or they might be a genius.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He's searching for the less-than-perfectly polished founder, who resembles his once less-than-perfectly polished colleagues, a group that turned a hot mess into one of the world's largest public companies. And then this is a great quote from Elon reflecting on his time. "We were really very focused on building the best product we could. We were incredibly obsessive about, how do we evoke something that is really going to have the best possible customer experience," Musk said, "That is far more effective selling -- building their product, I mean, a fantastic product, that was a far more effective selling tool than having a giant sales force." And then Peter talks about the valuable lesson that the people at PayPal learned. And he says, "They learned the best lesson, that it's hard but doable." And Michael Jordan, his autobiography, said the same thing. He says, "It's hard but fair. I live by those words." And then I'll close here with Max on Founders. "PayPal's earliest employees reserve the highest praise for those who tread the same stony road, founders across varied fields of endeavor. Those that bring the big ideas into hard, unpredictable reality are the practitioners, the high-leverage ones, and I admire them almost without reservation," Max wrote. "One key ingredient of being this kind of person is an almost irrational lack of fear of failure and irrational optimism. They managed to not get caught up in all the little details while being remarkably aware of the really important ones."

And that is where I'll leave it. I can unequivocally highly recommend reading this book every single entrepreneur, every single founder, every single person who is attempting to do something difficult in their lives will draw lessons from the book that you can use in the future. If you want to support the podcast and get the book at the same time, you can buy the book using the link in the show notes in your podcast player. If you want to buy a friend or a coworker, get a subscription to Founders, that link is also in the show notes, and you can also get that at founderspodcast.com. This is number -- I actually don't know when this is coming out because I cannot release it until after the book is released. So that's an unknown number of books down, 1,000 to go. And I'll talk to you again soon.

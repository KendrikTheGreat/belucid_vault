People write and read biographies because their subjects stood out for doing something, for being something out of the realm of the everyday. They created something new, solved the problem, sparked a movement, altered established courses, method, and thinking. That's what Levi was. He didn't invent blue jeans, but without him the most iconic garment in fashion history might never have been more than just duck cloth pants on the rear ends of Nevada's miners and teamsters. Without Levi's business sense and vision, which allowed him to see the potential of those little metal rivets, the overalls might have seen the light of day, but they would not have thrived. Levi didn't run orphanages and kindergartens, but he saw to it that their doors were kept open for those who ran them and for those who desperately needed the safety of their walls. He wasn't a teacher, but he gave enough money to a growing university so that its teachers could steer new generations of students towards the future. He didn't hold any political office, but his good advice, solid bank account, and respected voice were sought out by politicians and policymakers. His vast dry good business allowed families of remote locations to have a few comforts in the midst of hardship. San Francisco's fame for first and for icons of all kinds. The cable car, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Beat Generation, the Summer of Love, the rise of the hippie, gay liberation, and the tech revolution. These inventions, designs, and culture revolutions blossomed because San Francisco had a solid core for them to spring from. That core was commerce. Without the goal that the cities past rested on, its future residents would have had no place to come to. And Levi Strauss was one of the men who set that firm foundation.

Okay. So that was actually towards the end of the book that I want to talk to you about today, which is Levi Strauss: The Man Who Gave Blue Jeans to the World by Lynn Downey. So before we jump into the book, reviews and ratings on Apple Podcasts are extremely important. And you probably already know this because undoubtedly, you've heard other podcasts reference this fact. And so I've thought a lot about a way, like what is the best way to encourage people because it's so important to leave ratings and reviews. And a lot of you have already done so, and you've done just because you wanted to be kind and you enjoyed this podcast, which I really appreciate. But I think when -- something I've learned from studying and reading all these books is humans do respond to some incentives. So I was trying to figure out a way to have some kind of mutually beneficial exchange. So -- because it's important to me for the podcast to get a lot of ratings and reviews. How can I basically reward you for taking a few minutes of your time? So I actually came up with an idea that I think is -- well, right now, it's the best idea that I have in regards to this. So I think the best way than just asking you is to offer you something of tangible value. So here's what I propose. If you leave a rating and review on Apple Podcasts or iTunes, if you take a screenshot and then you e-mail it to me at foundersreviews@gmail.com, I'll also leave the e-mail address in the show notes, I will e-mail you back a link to short little podcasts. They're like short little versions of Founders that I'm doing, only for people that leave reviews. So they're not going to be on my main feed. These podcasts are not going to appear on the main feed. They're not going to appear on the subscription, the Patrion-only podcast either. It's literally only for people that leave reviews. And if you've already left a review, then obviously just e-mail me and I'll send you the link as well. I already have one done.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But inspired by Steve Jobs, there is one more thing. This is not a one-off trade. If you e-mail me a screenshot of your review, not only will I send you a link to the podcast I've already completed for this purpose, but I will continue to e-mail you reviewer-only podcast in perpetuity. I plan on doing these shorter review-only podcasts about 3 to 4 times a year. And as I thought about it, I think it's a pretty fair trade. For a minute or 2 of your time, I will send you hours of work on a reoccurring basis. Okay. Let's get into today's book. So we're going to start out on Levi's early life. So the book says, "His early life, like that of his fellow Jewish newcomers, began as humbly as what 19th century Bavaria had to offer." So he was born in a place called Bavaria, which I don't -- I had never heard of. So I had to look it up. And it turns out, during the time that he was born, he was born into something called the Kingdom of Bavaria, which only lasted from 1805 to 1918. And it's a -- it was a German state that succeeded from the former electorate of Bavaria. But I want to describe for you the reality of his early life and why his family eventually fled to America. And it has something to do with this thing called -- it's a German word, so I don't know how to pronounce it, but it translates to the Jew Law. So I want to describe to you what his society was like. So it says, "The boy whom America would transform into the man called Levi Strauss, began life with the first name Löb. Young Löb was born into a society that believed it had 'emancipated' its Jews and given them the rights of full citizens. In reality, Jews had only those rights that made the Bavarian government and Christian Society comfortable." It gives a little background of what was taking place in like the 10th Century up until this point. It says, "Over the next 700 years," so from, let's say, 1,000 to around the time where the story picks up, "Over the next 700 years, Jews were repeatedly expelled or exterminated, allowed to return and then forced to leave their homes again. At the end of the 17th century, they began to trickle back into what becomes Bavaria.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And here are some restrictions: They were allowed complete freedom of worship, but rabbis had to have command of the German language. Only villages overseen by a local police force could have a rabbi. Congregations without synagogue could worship in private homes, but Jews could not have secret private gatherings for any other reason. Once in effect," this German word appears again, I'm just going to call it the Jew Law. "The Jew Law decreed these traditional occupations off limits and Jews were forced to take up farming and crafts. There were some exceptions though, men who were already engaged in pedaling before 1813 and could not learn any other trade were allowed to continue. Others learned a new trade on paper, but practice the old one in reality." So his dad was like rather old; he had like 8 or 10 kids. And he was something -- known as something called a peddler. So when they're using the word peddler in this book, it's really like a door-to-door salesman where they were poor enough -- they were too poor to have a store, but doing well enough that they could still support their family. So all of the goods that they -- and products that they would sell, they had to carry with them. And so the Bavarian government eventually said, no, like only Christians could do this, Jewish couldn't. So it says, "The Jew Law left its mark everywhere, from individuals to entire villages, and the Strauss family were among them. So I'm not going to spend too much time on his life before he gets to America, but there are some parts that -- some highlights I want to hit that I think are interesting. So it's talking about his dad. He says, "He continued to work as a peddler even though the Jew Law forbade its practice. Nearly 50 years old when Löb was born, he could not pick up a new profession. His sons, however, we're not so lucky. They could not follow in the family business or choose any other traditional Jewish trade. Löb was expected to become a farmer, tanner, weaver, cobbler, soap maker, or other small craftsmen. And even though they might find training or work, they would have to do it alone. The new rules regarding marriage made most men ineligible as husbands and the available women were snatched up by those who were."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So the restrictions of the Jewish law in Bavaria at that time even applied to like things you could do in person -- like your personal life, like who you could marry, what kind of work you could do, if you could gather like large groups of people, where you could workshop, all kinds of stuff that's frankly none on the government's business. So the next note I left to myself said they're looking for tolerance and the freedom to be left alone. And it says, "The Jew Law was designed to make proper citizens of Bavarian Jews and it did for the United States. As the government gave with one hand and took away with the other, thousands of Jews left Bavaria to find religious and social tolerance across the ocean." So his dad winds up passing away and this happens, what I'm about to describe to you, happens over a few short years. His dad passes away, leaving his mom a widow. She remarries, the second husband dies as well. So now at this time, Löb is one of the youngest of the children, and most of his older brothers have already left for America. And it says, "Now a double widow and possession of 2 homes with no husband or grown male children to protect or support her, Rebecca," which is his mom, "made the only logical choice she could. It was time to move to America." So the process of getting out of Bavaria was not that simple. It took them, I think, almost 2 years to finally petition the government. And we're going to -- we get some of Levi's first words on record and a plea for him to immigrate to America. And this is now Levi speaking, and he's about 17 or 18 years old at the time. And he says, "The favorable news that I've received from my stepbrothers in America has convinced me to follow them, even though I do not have at this time a specific occupation, but my brothers will take care of that. No members of my family will stay behind," and I love this sentence, "I will share the fate that has been assigned to me with them in foreign lands. I thus join my mother in her plea."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Now the book spends a great deal of time talking about how dangerous these voyages across the sea were at the time they're doing it. And yet the conditions in many of these countries in Europe were so poor that people risk their lives to come to America. And I'm just going to read you one description of the dangers that I think give you an idea. But on a personal note, I just -- I think this is something that really sticks out to me because I don't -- I've talked about this on the podcast I'm pretty sure in the past, but -- my own father was born in Cuba, and he was a baby right after Castro took over and forced to flee. They wind up in New York first. So they ran away from the Communist government, like hundreds, thousands, if not millions of Cubans did. They landed in New York first and then eventually settled in Miami, where there's obviously a large Cuban population. But the reason I bring that up is because what I was thinking about here is you have Rebecca taking, I think it was Levi and his younger sister and getting on a boat, many of these boats were -- they crash at sea, they disappeared, people died. And it was so bad and they were under such persecution in Bavaria that they -- she risk not only her life but the life of her children. And I saw this when I was growing up because we would have people come over. So there's something called Noche Buena in the Cuban culture, where it's like a big celebration of -- like they celebrate greatly Christmas on Christmas Eve. And usually, they do so with a party. They eat pigs and dance and do all sort of stuff.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

A specific design that could be associated with -- this is the important part, "A specific design that could be associated with the company's riveted overalls 5 years ahead of the event could go a long way toward keeping customer loyalty when competitors' products hit store shelves. It also had a cultural function," check this out, "some new Westerners were either illiterate or did not speak English as their first language. Many people navigated the world through symbols. Think of the 3 balls outside of a pawnshop," which before I read this book, I didn't even notice. Now every time I drive -- I was in the car yesterday, and I passed much of pawnshops, I was like, oh my god, there is 3 balls there. I never noticed it. It's like 3 balls connected, like you've probably seen it. So it says, "think of the 3 balls outside of a pawnshop or the striped barber pole, a man could go into a store and ask for the overalls with the 2 horses on the label." So this made me think of something I've always fascinated with, like how we really think about -- because I know I'm obsessed with podcasts, and -- but I don't know how obvious it is to everybody else, how big of a revolution this is. So I was listening to a podcast and somebody was describing -- somebody on that podcast was describing what they feel is taking place. And I'm just going to read the quote I wrote down when I was listening to that podcast. And it said, "There is a technological," -- and you'll understand when I'm done, why it relates to what I just read, "there is a technological revolution. It is a deep one. The technological revolution is an online video and audio, immediately accessible to everyone all over the world. What that has done is it has turned the spoken word into a tool that has the same reach as the printed word. It is a Gutenberg revolution in the domain of video and audio. It might be even deeper than the original Gutenberg revolution because it isn't at all obvious how many people can read, but lots of people can listen."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But anyways, we'd either host these gatherings or we go to these gatherings when I was kid and inevitably every single year, there would be people that had fled from Cuba on rafts, man-made rafts and that's like -- that's -- there's being a generous description of what they actually did, and you can Google this if you're really interested in. And I don't know, I got to meet these people when I was younger, usually through a translator because I don't speak Spanish, but -- and they only did. But you just realize how -- again, this -- I guess this thing is -- these kind of situations are -- they're -- you see them in history constantly. And you're even seeing them now in some places in the world, modern-day, but just the idea that you would get on something that -- I mean it's just a man-made raft and you would go across 90 to 120 miles of open ocean with no tools, knowing that many people that have done so died doing so, just to get away and have opportunity. I don't know, it's just -- it's something that I've always thought about and I've always kept with me. And that's why -- I don't know maybe that's why I'm kind of an advocate for entrepreneurship because I think like people should have the freedom to make their own way in the world at a fundamental level. And you see when that freedom is denied, the great lengths people will go to, to get that freedom. So to me, that's almost like a universal human desire. So this description of the dangers, I'm not going to -- I mean, you obviously know these ships could crash and everything, but it's also they're cramped in uncomfortable quarters, and it says, "And not even the largest chamber pot could hold the volume of vomit that accompanied the seasickness of the first few weeks on the water."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I'm going to skip over the entire section of the journey because it's kind of outside of the scope of what we want to discuss here. And so now we -- at this point of the story, he is arriving in New York. His stepbrothers have started. So everybody comes here. And what's interesting to me, as we talked about last week, how entrepreneurship and starting new companies is at like a 40-year low in America, where you think it should be the exact opposite, right? What's interesting to me is like when you immigrated here a couple hundred years ago, you had little choice but like you could try to get a job, but most families just try to start their own business, and a lot of them were just peddlers. So they try to have a trade and then sell that or they try to produce or resell products or whatever they could. So his brothers came over. They started out as peddlers. They eventually worked their way up and got their own store. And then this is a little description, and I love this. And it's call -- they're talking about enduring hardship for the ultimate goal. And it says, "If they did experience hardship, they knew it wasn't forever. It was just something that had to be endured on the way to the ultimate goal, self-employment, and that was achieved with hard work, good connections and help from the family. Pedaling was usually the first rung in this ladder and the storefront came next. Becoming a manufacturer, managing factories and middlemen, and employing relatives was one that many men reach," meaning one status that many men reach. "There were also a few merchant princes who commanded glorious department stores are fabulously successful wholesale businesses." So right there, just -- it's kind of the whole spectrum of what you see even now today, where you can have a one-person business or creating something and you're just selling it to people or maybe like what people call like a mom-and-pop shop or whatever you want to call it, all the way up to giant corporations. So obviously, the scale is different today, but there was variance in the size and how the businesses were organized even back then.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So there's another sentence I just want to read you. It's the motivation to leave, "Making a good living and enjoying true personal agency was denied them in Europe, but encouraged and celebrated in the United States." So a few pages later, we find out like what is Levi's as a young man, an immigrant to New York, what is his life like. And so the book says, "From the day he arrived in America, young Levi's life was a round of family, workshop and no to the grindstone application to learning English in every detail of the dry goods business." So his family is in the dry goods business. The way to think about dry goods because I don't know if that's commonly used, actually had -- the book is a description, but I did try to find a way to summarize it for you. And this is the best one-sentence summary. It says, "In the U.S., a dry goods store carries consumer goods that are distinct from those carried by hardware stores or grocery stores." So a lot of this was like garments, textiles, stuff like that. So that's -- they're in the dry goods business. He and his family were helping to create the new New York, one that bustle with both people and industry and with commercial links to settlements springing up along America’s rivers, lakes and into its rich Westward farming country. So now we're going to get into the main -- I'm going to spend a few pages here, talking about the background at this time, right? And there's so many parallels today. I just -- this is one of my favorite things about trying to document the history of entrepreneurship. And so it's the gold rush. This is the revolution that is taking place that Levi built his entire business on the foundation in which he built his business on. So as the story is well known, on January 24, Midwest native and Amateur geologists, James Marshall, was working on the tail race of a sawmill when he -- that he was building for Swiss entrepreneur, John Sutter on the American. River near Sacramento. He used the mill race as a giant sluice, and after flushing the mill rate down to bedrock, he looked into a small still pool, put his hand into the freezing depths and brought out the nuggets that would ignite one of the greatest mass migrations in history, the California Gold Rush.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So as this entire time that I'm going to be talking about the gold rush for our purposes, let's think of it as a metaphor for the technological revolution that we're living through right now, the Internet revolution, if you want to get specific. So this is a description of the opportunity caused by the gold rush. A reporter writing in the February 19, 1852 issue of the New York Times stated that the febrile symptoms, I had to look up this word, febrile as like fever, of the California Gold Rush were not a passing fad. Here then is a limitless opening for industry and talent he wrote. "If anything describes the approach to the challenges of the gold rush, it is the words industry and talent with foresight gained from years of hard work and good news from those who are already in California, merchants realize that the best way to make money in mining was not to squat in a snow-fed river, but to have dry clothes ready for those who did." This is also known as pickaxe retailing that in a revolution, instead of trying to make money in the actual revolution, you should be making money selling tools to those that are doing that. That's at least one strategy. "Having perfected the pedaling and then wholesale and retail merchandising of American goods, while in New York and Ohio River towns, merchants who went to California went there well prepared. Few of them ended up as peddlers, mostly because California had enacted an anonymous tax on peddlers. But these merchants knew that opening stores in the small towns that blossom throughout the gold region was the best hope for success. Some stayed in New York and supplied California retailers exclusively." As the port city nears the gold fields, San Francisco was perfectly suited to be the way station for goods and men. Immigrants like the Strauss Brothers, came to New York just as demand for ready-to-wear clothing arose and then exploded. As more young men join the middle class, they enjoyed a growing prosperity, but this didn't always mean that they could afford tailor-made and personally fitted trouser shirts and vests. Most of them could not actually. So they talk about the people that open a store. They enter the clothing business relied on tiers of producers and manufacturers. Workers in their homes are in small shops produced for jobbers who then sold the goods to wholesalers and then distributors, okay? So that's the channels we're talking about.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

These men, in turn, had retail customers who got the items into the hands of the final purchaser, or consumer. By 1853, this interconnected system made the ready-to-wear clothing business, one of the biggest industries in the country with New York as its hub. This category included the garments prized by the new white collar class, but also covered the rougher shirts and trousers worn by farmers, laborers and soon, California gold miners. Okay, so there -- the Strauss family is already in the dry goods business before the gold rush. And so they were uniquely positioned to take advantage of this. And you're going to see that by just doing the best job they could, they wind up -- you can't predict opportunity in the future, right? But if you -- sometimes, you're lucky enough to be in a situation where you're already in a good position and you could take advantage of a huge opportunity. Levi is actually already, I think it's like 20 years into a successful career as a wholesaler and manufacturer of dry goods. And that's when he has an even larger opportunity to do the blue jeans, but we'll get there. So they identify a hole in the market. So by 1852, the Strauss family was surely hearing many stories about the travels of their fellow Jews and their successes in California. Friends and neighbors shared letters from relatives out West and commercial ties were made and strengthened, and it became obvious that the gold rush was not a fluke. Although some people went to California for a while, made a handsome profit, and then came back to New York, the majority decided to make California their permanent home. Merchants helped little gold rush towns prosper. They help build small cities into major ones and provided everyone from miners to comfortable families with what they needed. In fact, by the early 1850s, it was obvious that more than sturdy work clothes and boots were required. That's the whole. Gold meant wealth, but wealth was relative. It wasn't just about buying the most expensive house furnished with French imports, there were other dreams beyond material goods. To be a -- to a labor, enough gold could mean no more calloused hands or a back no longer bent under a hod filled with bricks. Middle-class, white-collar clerks longed for an escape from the stifling regimen of the office. At the conscious level, the rushers thought only of holding the gold in their hands, but at the deeper level, a true desire -- excuse me, but at the deeper level of true desire, gold meant freedom.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Some people had it very clear in their mind that gold was a means to an end and not an end in and of itself. It was another avenue to achieving the goals," -- this is important, "It was another avenue to achieving the goals that consume them from the minute they hit American soil. Economic autonomy, support for their families, and participation in a shared community with freedom from fear." So the note I left on that page was another meaning of wealth, human nature doesn't change, and a quote from Thomas Edison. So one of the benefits of me reading all these books and then recently have had to go back and listen to some of my old podcasts because I've been taking notes and trying to make sure that it catalog everything that I've learned. And so all of this -- there's so many times where I just read like a paragraph and it's -- my mind just compares it automatically, it's something that's seen before. So I want to read something from the biography of Thomas Edison that I read like 2 years ago. It's called the Wizard of Menlo Park. And it really made me think of that, the paragraph I just read to you. And I would say like my own personal like life goal and has been for a while, well, it's something that's not new because this is a summary of Thomas Edison in 1869, okay? So it says -- and I think this probably applies to a lot of people that are listening to this right now. And it says, "Having one's own shop, working on projects of one's own choosing, making enough money today, so one could do the same tomorrow." These were the modest goals of Thomas Edison when he struck out on its own as full-time inventor and manufacturer. The grand goal was nothing other than enjoying the autonomy of entrepreneur and forestalling a return to the servitude of employee. Edison's need for autonomy was primal and unbearing. It would determine the course of his career from beginning to end. So it's a really amazing thing about books. And I think podcast too or anything that you're learning, whatever medium you're choosing, is that you just never know these ideas that stick on your mind. But I remember that -- I haven't read that maybe, what, 1.5 years, 2 years. I don't know the exact time frame, but a long time.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And immediately, when I was reading this Levi Strauss book, I said, "Oh, I got to go pull that Thomas Edison book, because that's what it sounds like." And that's why I love. I think I talked about this before, and maybe it's helpful for you. But I don't just like read books like -- if you were -- if I could show you pictures of these books, like they're constantly marked up. This one has probably 50 different posted notes ticking out. All those posted notes correlate to highlights or underlines that I've made in the book, summaries of what's in them. I write indexes on the back pages to try to like a quick one-page reference to what's in the book, like my own index, not like, obviously, a lot of these books have annexes, but it's really an index of ideas. Because what happens is I usually don't just read them once, I go back and I pick it up and instead of spending -- reading the book -- having to read the book, like I can find these what I'm looking for easily. And I also talked about why -- what's something that's helpful. If you really love a book. One, if I really love a book, I want the hardcover or the physical format in my house just because I like having them. And then I'll also usually buy the Kindle book of books I really love because Kindle let you search for specific phrases and terms that you might want to go back and review because, like I said, like you're constantly changing. The ideas that are resonating with you today, if you go back and revisit them a few years from now, you'll probably gain additional meaning from them. Okay. So Levi, let's see, now we're going to see -- so we know what's going on with gold rush, right? And there's this huge opportunity. And Levi is eventually going to leave New York to go out and try to build the family business, his own business, which turns into Levi Strauss company, which -- something I didn't, I didn't know. I had to do additional research preparing for this podcast. I didn't know Levi Strauss, it's still privately owned. I thought it's such a well-known brand. And of course, it could probably went public or whatever the case is, no, it's family owned and has been since he founded it in the 1800s.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. So Levi was 23. He had 5 years of New York dry goods experience under his belt, and he was unmarried. And he is going to be the one responsible for building the family business in California. And it says, "If Levi had shown no talent for commerce, if he had to come to New York's temptations and spend his nights in dissipation or if he had decided to take up different line of work, he wouldn't have been right for the job. The fact that they did send the youngest brother on what was known to be a dangerous journey and risky commercial undertaking meant that this much older -- that his much older brothers had complete confidence in his abilities." Something I repeat constantly is how lucky we are to be alive in the age of the Internet and how it makes building businesses while never easy, way easier, this section is fascinating like all I thought about when I was reading this book was like, wow, like, I have no reason to ever complain if I have any kind of hardship given what this guy had to go through to do what he's doing. So it said next few pages, it's a play on words, it's one of my favorite books that I read is Nick Bostrom's Superintelligence: Path, Dangers, Strategies. And so I love to note off for myself to summarize this part is getting to California, path, dangers, and strategies. "With news of the gold discovery in California made its way east at the end of 1848, frenzied men brought out their pick and shovel inventories of hardware stores and said goodbye to worried families. Knowing that they were streamers" -- excuse me, "steamers leaving for Panama," steamer is a boat, kind of boat. "They headed by the hundreds for -- they had to buy the hundreds for New York to catch the next available boat, clogging docks and the boats themselves. The reason to choose Panama can be summed up in one word: speed. There were 3 ways to get to California from the East and Midwest at the end of the 1840s. One was in a clipper ship going around Cape Horn at the tip of South America and then up the coast of San Francisco. Residents of New York and other mid-Atlantic states usually chose this route because to head over land, you'd have to get to a jumping-off place like St. Joseph or independent Missouri, a hard trek on its own. Once chosen, both of these routes could take from 3 to 6 months or longer and each had its own unique dangers. Trails across the country were unmarked with scarce or bad water. Indian attacks were rare, but always on immigrants mines and diseases like cholera."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Come on, I can pronounce this. Come on, guys. Here we go. All right. "Diseases like cholera claimed more lives than historians will ever know. A clipper ship journey meant frigid cold and searing heat and the rounding or doubling of the horn with such a horror, it inspired dozens of seafaring songs. A typical refrain was, 'I wish to God, I'd never been born to drag my carcass across Cape Horn.' If speed wasn't the object, either of these routes would get a traveler to California eventually. But if it was gold, speed was essential, getting to the American river as soon as possible meant choosing one of 2 Central American routes, one created by Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt and Nicaragua took travelers on a very wet journey on the San Juan River and Lake Nicaragua. And then on a road, the rest of the way to meet San Francisco-bound steamers on the Pacific. The Panama route was more popular and conditions improved as the 1950s progressed." Keep in mind, there's going to be, I think, a 2-part series I'm doing on the Commodore, on Cornelius Vanderbilt very soon. I don't think you could do a podcast on the history of entrepreneurship without mentioning him. He is a character to say the least. Okay, so it talks about they've started on the 40s doing this. By the 50s, they got better at it. And here's a description. It says, "The ships puffed from New York through the Caribbean to the mouth of some river that I can't pronounce on Panama's Eastern coastline. There passengers loaded themselves and their baggage into bungoes." So I'm not familiar this word. It's B-U-N-G-O-E-S, bungoes. These -- and what they are, the flat-bottom boats piloted by indigenous people that took an average of 2 days and nights to reach 1 of the 2 trailheads. Now remember, I'm spending time in this section because this is describing what Levi had to go through to get to California before he even was able to found his business. "Travelers then either rented a mule or walk the final 18 miles to Panama City, sometimes waiting days or weeks for another steamer to take them to San Francisco. By the time Levi Strauss landed in Panama around Valentine's Day of 1853, the crossing was a more organized and modernized operation.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The Panama railroad was partially completed across the Isthmus by this time. In addition, the steamship companies put more ships into service. So the men and women who made it to Panama City rarely had to wait more than a day or 2 for a boat to take them to San Francisco. Although the River transit had its dangers, alligators, drowning, yellow fever," now this is the crazy part, one of crazy parts, "the trails were the most worrisome part of the journey. Travelers were at their most vulnerable because both roads went through narrow canyons or dense jungle, which gave highwaymen, plenty of places to hide. Robberies and murders happened on the trails at all times of the year, though they mostly targeted those going home from the gold fields, their packs full of plunder of the American river." So Levi, he survives that. He gets to San Francisco. I just want to share this one part that's relentlessly resourceful. I just love when people -- like they come up with these clever -- entrepreneurs come up with these clever ideas to build businesses out of stuff that's like in plain sight. It's just like you had to come up with a good idea to do this. So people are rushing San Francisco because of gold rush. And I'm just going to read it because it's funny, it brings a smile to my face. "Hundreds of gold-fevered sailors abandoned their vessels as soon as they made landfall in San Francisco, staying only long enough to outfit themselves for the trip inland. While the entrepreneurs haul the ships right up to the shoreline, made them secure, and turn them into warehouses and lodgings." I love that. All right. So this is where he starts his business, and I left a note off to myself, as Levi starts his business cold. So he arrives in San Francisco. The plan is he's going to found the business, his suppliers are going to be his brothers who are manufacturing stuff in New York. So let's manufacture stuff in New York. We'll ship it to San Francisco, Levi starts a business where he can wholesale and then market up in wholesale and start making money. And -- but at the time, he has no contacts in San Francisco, so he has to start his business cold. So he has to wait a few months because like I just described, you could ship something from New York to San Francisco, but it takes a long time.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So they ship it on January, they expect it to arrive in March. "With this information in hand, knowing that 3 shiploads of dry goods would start arriving at the end of March, he hit the payment to find his first customers. The easiest and most efficient way to get started was simply to call in the retailers already established in San Francisco." It lists a bunch of the companies. The company names are not important. So the retailers, hotels and restaurants could also -- would also be on his list. So he just goes -- doesn't have any contacts, he just goes door-to-door, hey, you're a retailer, I'm a wholesaler. Can I offer you something? Can we build a relationship? As simple as that. So started off from very humble beginnings. As you'll see, and I'm going to share the good thing about this book is one, it's written by an employee of Levi Strauss that was hired as an historian of the company. And so the part I'm not going to include on the podcast, but it's in the book is there was a great fire, I think, in 1906, that destroyed all of the Levi -- a lot of the Levi Strauss company documents. So she had to go back and spend several years. She traveled to like where he was born, down to South America, all the places that are important to the Levi Strauss story to like recreate and obtain information. And she was also able to find like public records of like income, like how much money they were sending because a lot of the stuff was on like ships. I don't know what they're called, registers of the stuff they're carrying. There's a specific term that escapes me at the moment. But if you're -- let's say, you want to ship 1,000 tons of gold or whatever, you know that what's on the boat and then we can know what gold was worth at the time, and you can kind of guess. Basically, it's a way to work backwards and find out revenue numbers. And then we also find like profit margin stuff. And I'm going to -- of course, share that on the podcast because that to me is interesting, and it gives you concrete -- like a concrete understanding of the success that the company was having.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

What I love about this book is she gives a lot of background on San Francisco. And I just think it's fascinating to understand the history of places, kind of give you an idea of why certain industries started in specific places as opposed to others. So it says, "In 1855, journalists and occasional politician," his name is not important, "compiled and published a remarkable book called the Annals of San Francisco. This enormous tome recounted the history of the city from the early exploration period to the current day. It covered everything from the history of the post office to benevolent institutions to the great fires to a month-by-month accounting of the events from 1853 to 1855, with copies of the California Constitution and the city's charter thrown in. It is a clear-headed look at San Francisco's personality as well as history. In describing the city's life during 1853, the authors wrote that San Francisco was still as in its early router years, a place of hard labor and wild delights." Okay, so skipping ahead, I've left myself 3 notes on this. It says the financials, which we're going to get into numbers, which I think is fascinating. History doesn't repeat itself, human nature does, which we talk about all the time, and this time it's not different. So now we're going to -- at this point, I'm fast forwarding, he's already built his business. He starts getting shipments from his brother. He sells it and slowly and steadily just starts building this up, little by little. And over the next 2 years, Levi continue to build his business and fell into a comfortable commercial routine of taking in shipments from his brothers and finding new customers. The following year was busier." This is 1855. "And in July, Levi made the first shipment of gold back to New York to fill the coffers of Jay Strauss & Brother," this is his brothers’ company that he's getting dry goods from, "and to pay for future shipments of dry goods." That month, he sent $10,041, equivalent to nearly $250,000 today. So remember, this is a booming, booming industry. These numbers are going to get crazy.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I want to give you some background before I continue, though. "What's remarkable about this activity is that in February 1855, a financial panic brought much of San Francisco's business to its knees. A property owner and builder of a wharf that he named for himself, Henry Meeks, had a lot of loans that he could not repay. So we skipped town for South America, leaving enormous debts behind him and causing city bankers to become very nervous. At the same time, a dry winter meant less water in the gold regions, which meant less gold to mine and deposit into San Francisco banks. The banks could therefore not make loans or they made them with exorbitant interest rates. When a railroad supported by investments of the bank of," nonimportant name, "went under the bank, which is one of California's 2 largest, did 2. This was followed by the failure of," another name of bank, nonimportant, which was California's largest bank. "A run on San Francisco banks caused nearly 200 bankruptcies. Though the city had financial ties to New York and other urban centers, the panic of 1855 was, for the most part, a local phenomenon, thanks to the city's economic anarchy in the first years of the gold rush. Despite the panic, Levi sent 5 more boatloads of gold to New York between August and December, making a grand total of the year over $80,000 or $2 million in today's currency. This pile of money was worthy of the word used to describe it, treasure." So when you're sending stuff back, that's the term the shipping company would use. The reason I included that part is because it over -- one of the overarching themes of this podcast is something that is really important for all of us to internalize is that because human nature remains relatively constant throughout history, it's -- we should understand that economic booms and busts are inevitable. So I have a book, while I'm recording, on the table that I read a few years ago that I recommend that's not about founders, but it's equally important. It says, "This time is different, 8 centuries of financial folly." And it basically is a pretty in-depth look into 800 years of financial crisis. And it's -- listen, it's not like a book you're going to read underneath the tree just for fun.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

There's a lot of economic data in here. But even if you just look at the charts, buy the book just to look at the charts and the index, like they have -- in the indexes, they have historical summaries of banking crisis. And the book's price is worth it just looking for that. It's not just relegated to United States. It's everywhere constantly. And to me, it just -- it's just a reminder that like instead of trying to time when economic booms or busts, you just need to make yourself robust so you can weather the inevitable storm and understand that it's not forever. It's just fantastic. It's really mind-blowing. Okay. So on the very next page, we're starting a new chapter, and we're going to get into something that is just mind-blowing to me and more numbers here because, again, I love numbers, in general. I just think it's fascinating. So well, let me -- before I read you my note, let me read this part of the book. "Customers who shop the retail stores in the mountain towns which sold dry goods, cigars, liquors, clothing, fancy goods, farm equipment, and hardware, paid for the purchases in gold dust. The store owners would use the dust to pay their own suppliers, employing a method unique to the gold rush. They gathered up enough dust to pay a small collection of invoices from their own suppliers and then send both the paperwork and the gold to one of their main San Francisco purveyors such as Levi Strauss. Levi had a scale in his office to weigh the gold dust and figure out its value according to purity and the current rates. Generally, gold dust circulated at $17.50 an ounce in the early years of Levi's business. After weighing and measuring the dust, he could then use it to pay off all of its customers' miscellaneous bills, depositing the remainder to his account as credit against that customer's future business. In essence, Levi and other merchants acted as bankers for their own customers."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This maybe think of them before I get into like the inflation caused by the gold rush, something that's taking place in present-day that's interesting is this boom of cryptocurrency that's happened over the past, let's say, 5 or 6 years. And I have no idea whether it's going to last, and it's like going to fundamentally change, even though I am intrigued by the idea. So I'm just not in the business of trying to make predictions because I think it's like -- you just can't. So what's funny to me though is how people are like, "Oh, the criticism of cryptocurrency, oh, it's not real money." And I'm like, yes, it's not real money, but did you know during the gold rush, people paid in gold dust, like just this idea of means of exchange or currency if you want to use that term? Again, having an understanding, being well-read of history, you realize that these things change all the time. Later in the book, there's -- I'm not going to cover it. There's like people are fighting and killing each other over the difference between using what they call sound money, meaning money back by gold versus greenbacks versus using silver. And it's just you realize, oh, okay, like people are going to fight over currency all the time and just realize that what we use for currency changes constantly throughout time. So I just think that's probably valuable. All right. So "although the extravagant prices of the early gold rush years had fallen, the cost of living in San Francisco is still on the high side." Check this out, "meats cost," and I'm going to convert it. I'm not going to -- for this, I'm just going to convert it to today's money. "meats cost $10 a pound. Butter was $27 a pound. A dozen eggs, $34." So that's really expensive, but we would love if this was the case today. "Rent $500," and that was expensive for them. "Running a business could be just as expensive. There was so much to pay for insurance against the losses of goods, while they were being shipped, water damage from the voyage, theft, freight rates from New York to San Francisco could be anywhere from 10% to 50% of the value of one of the cargo," how crazy is that?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"But that wasn't the end of it. After the steamer arrived in port, merchants had to pay fees to pilots, the harbor master and the wharf owners. Then, men like Levi had to hand over custom duties, pay for the cost of transporting the shipment from boat to the warehouse, rent on the warehouse itself and finally, an annual city license, which fluctuated according to a merchant's monthly receipts." And even with all these expenses, Levi's business was doing fantastically well. So in the year 1856, Levi shipped over $200,000 in Treasure in New York, worth an astonishing $5 million today. This on the next page was interesting because it's something you see today, too. 'Because of the way the state constitution was written, individual cities in California had something called the home rule, meaning that they could make their own laws as long as it did not violate the U.S. Constitution. In San Francisco, that meant doubling of both taxes and city expenses by 1856." And why are they doubling taxes because they had to make up for other stuff, which, again, this still happens today? It says, "Fires, bank failures, and the dumping of unwanted goods by merchants unable to sell them, did not keep elected officials from raising taxes and imposing new license fees on all business owners." So now we're going to talk about another headache that he had to deal with -- 2 headaches, the dangers of shipping by sea, and then this prejudice in issuing credit to Jewish people. So let's get some details here. So it says, "The business was increasing, too. The California Board of Equalization published a list of the city's personal property assessments in the August edition of the San Francisco Evening. It said Levi Strauss was worth $20,000," equivalent to nearly 50 -- or excuse me, $0.5 million today. So he's making a great amount of progress in just a few short years. It says -- okay, so here -- this is actually a huge issue. So he's going to lose about $2 million here, $2 million in today's money that is.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"So in August 1857, he arranges to ship its goods, gold," and it says, "it's worth nearly $2 million." I want to skip over that because it's not important. And it's on a boat called the Central America, okay? And the Central America -- so he ships this in August. "He finds out at the end of October that the Central America had gone down in a hurricane 130 miles off the North Carolina shore with a loss of over 400 passengers in all the cargo and treasure. This was a great and sorrowful calamity for San Francisco as many people in the city had friends or relatives among the dead. For merchants, it was a financial catastrophe. More than 30 companies or individual business owners had sent a total of," and I'm just going to translate it to today's worth, "$40 million of treasure on the ship." So this one boat going down cost merchants in San Francisco, $40 million. So it says -- and then here's the repercussions from that. "The loss of the Central America meant that over $1 million in gold was now at the bottom of the Atlantic and not in New York bank vaults. This causes another panic. So depositors begin to withdraw their accounts at a frightening rate and the entire American economy shriveled. It took literally 2 years for a recovery to take hold." There's a bunch of financial panics in Levi's life, and this is just one of them. And then this is what I want to get on the same page, it talks about, well, let me, I guess get there. "Wholesalers who lost money could not buy more goods if their credit was not top notch." So of course, in most financial panics, you see this tightening of credit. "And it was difficult to collect debts from local customers if they had also been affected by the disaster. Levi Strauss survived and actually prosper because his suppliers were his own brothers. He did not have to worry about saving his credit rating with an Eastern jobber." So you're probably familiar with the Dun & Bradstreet company, still exists today. This time, it was called something, Dun and somebody else. So they would make these reports -- they collect data and make these reports on the creditworthiness of businesses. And if the business was owned by Jewish people, in the report on the company, they'd have a warning basically that Jewish people were not to be trusted.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So like just -- I guess, again, I don't think we're unfortunately going to ever be done with humans being prejudiced against other groups that are not like them. But yes, it's just so stupid. So he had to deal with that. The way he got around that is obviously, he didn't need the credit because this credit was his own family. And to that end, his family, even though they were separate companies, was kind of like vertically integrated. Skipping ahead a little bit. Now he's expanding his investments. He does a bunch of other businesses. His main business forever is Levi Strauss & Company, but he's just very industrious and constantly interested in expanding not only his personal net worth, but I would say the overall GDP of the industry he is operating in. So it said, "Levi ended the decade of the 1850s with a preview of his own future. In addition to enjoying continuous commercial success, he started to buy stock, snatched up valuable real estate and expanded his philanthropy, and became interested in politics." And a few pages later, there's another more losses. In this case, he loses about $2 million. And it's on a steamer called the Golden Gate. It was carrying passengers, mails, and treasures from Panama to New York. It caught fire in its galley and over 175 people drowned and all of the papers and gold went to the bottom of the Caribbean. So in that case, he lost $2 million on that one boat. This is just, again, I'm bringing this up because it's just a reminder of the realities of the troubles and tribulations that he had to endure to build his business. Oh, and this is another reminder. So what's interesting to me is the focus of this book is happening in California, right? And when I think of -- but it's -- all these events are taking place during the U.S. civil war.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so when I read Team of Rivals, this biography of Abraham Lincoln fantastic book goes into a lot of detail specifically about the time from when he ran for office and up until his assassination. So most of it is about the civil war. But it always focuses on like -- when I think of the civil war, I think of like the East Coast, I never thought about the West Coast ever before this book. And maybe because I live on the East Coast and so I'm like predisposed to just kind of apply it to things I'm more familiar with. But this paragraph, I just wanted to put this in the podcast because it gives us more context about all the events that are happening while he has to build his business. And he says, "During the war, California Gold was as essential as beef to the union's war efforts. In order to obtain and secure good credit with allies, Britain and France, gold was a vital backing for the government's currency. Between the start of the civil war in 1861 and its end in 1865, Levi Strauss shipped more -- shipped," -- I'm just going to tell you, "he shipped $31 million worth of gold in a 4-year period." Levi's friends and competitors sent equally large volumes of gold, all of which led Ulysses S. Grant to say, according to legend, that "California and its gold helped American Lincoln -- helped Abraham Lincoln win the war." Okay. So we're almost to the point where we get to the whole -- the main thing he's known for, which is the blue jeans. But this sentence reminded me of an opportunity to throw in one of my favorite quotes, the Peter Drucker quote, that entrepreneurship is not an art or science to practice and it's a description of -- once in a description of Levi and it says, "Being a merchant was not just what he did, it was who he was." And then finally, this is a description of Levi's business right before the invention of jeans.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I've just jumped over like 20 years here. So -- but I want to get to the jeans part. And the reporter -- there's a profile of Levi written by a reporter and it says, "The reporter was especially taken with the staff's efficiency. If a city merchant should call at 8:00 in the morning, he might have purchases of the amount of $50,000 and have every article delivered to his store by 1:00 in the afternoon on the same day. If time is money, there is no need of argument on this point." The article also uses the surprisingly modern corporate concept of empowerment when talking about how business got done. "In the absence of the principles, a purchaser should call in to buy -- if a purchaser should call in to buy $500,000 worth of goods, the Chief salesman is empowered to act in every particular as if he was a member of the firm." So that's just another example of decentralized command. "The reporter titled the article with a phrase that must have been gratifying to Levi, 'our solid merchants.' This reputation was already well known outside of San Francisco as well, and Levi's good name," -- this is the most important part and why I included this, "and Levi's good name would soon bring him an unusual business opportunity, a giant leap in profits, and the need to create an entirely new department for his headquarters." Okay, so with that foundation, he's able to capitalize on this opportunity. And we're going to be introduced to Jacob Davis, who is the inventor of jeans. It says, "Jacob Davis liked to tinker, likely by he was a Jewish immigrant and started his working life in the clothing business, and he was always thinking about how to improve the way things were done as well as how to improve his own life. And inventor at heart, he also find a way to reinvent himself." So I'm going to skip over a bunch of this where he has a bunch of different businesses, probably 5 or 6 different ones before he stumbles upon this. And this is how he invents jeans by accident. "Then in the spring of 1868, another massive silver discovery was made." He's living around the Nevada area. "A new rush was on and men from all over the state needed to outfit themselves to try their luck yet again. Jacob Davis realized that he could take advantage of this opportunity and began to specialize in making tents, wagon covers and horse blankets. But Jacob had been thinking about some ideas he add for clothing-related inventions. With inventing and improving on his mind, he decided to add a little something extra to the pants to please his customer," remember, he's a tailor by trade. "And then didn't think much more about it, but other people soon would.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

One of the fabrics that Jacob views most often and making wagon covers intense with something called duck, or ducking. It was a sturdily woven cotton fabric similar to canvas in appearance, but much stronger. But he also used duck to make pants for the teamsters in town or sometimes, he uses denim. Jacob needed to buy more fabric but didn't know of any places locally where he could get it." Good thing that Levi does. "But he did know about Levi Strauss & Company." Remember the book, which is talking about he had a good reputation. And so this is where his -- some of his relatives had purchased some things from Levi previously, where they brought the amount of duck fabric and they were in town of San Francisco, so they brought the amount of duck fabric that Jacob needed. So through relatives, Jacob gets this fabric that he needs for -- from Levi. And a few months later, he's in a shop and a woman comes in. So it says, "A woman came into Jacob's tailoring shop. Her husband needed a pair of cheap pants. This is kind of funny. She came into the shop to place their order. He had worn out his last pair of trousers and she hoped to get him a new pair before the New Year. Jacob told her that he needed to have her husband's measurements, and she tardily replied that he could not very well come because he had nothing to put on." So he is pant-less. "The woman told Jacob, her husband was really rough on his trousers, and she asked him to make the pants as strong as possible. Using the duck fabric he had bought from Levi Strauss & Company, Jacob sewed up the trousers, thinking about how he might make them sturdier. As he recalled, 'I was making horse blankets and covers for the teamsters at the time and had used rivets for the straps in the blankets. Those straps were not sown with seams, but they were riveted together. So when the pants were done, the rivets were lying on the table and the thought struck me to fasten the pockets with these rivets. I had never thought of that before.' So he makes these pants, people see her husband, who now has pants and can go out in and public walking around, and they eventually want these new riveted pants, which we are going to come to know as jeans, which happened by accident because they just happened to be on the table while he's making these pants at the request of this lady to make them stronger."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he's a tailor. He's got a family to support. He's got a wife and kids, but he's had a bunch of businesses that didn't work out, right? And -- but now he's like, "Damn, I stumbled on to something and these people really want it, but I don't have enough money to reinvest into this business." So he tells his wife, he is like, "yes, I'm going to build another business" and his wife is really upset. And you're going to see how this twist of fate winds up. He winds up becoming partners with Levi over this. "Based on his past experience, Jacob thought he might be able to patent his new style of pants, but his success as an inventor was not adding to the family bank account, applying for a patent was not cheap. And by the spring of 1872, Jacob's wife, Anne, was at her wit's end with how much time and money he had put into inventions that did not live up to their billing. In tears, she begged Jacob not to go down that road again. He knew he had to try to patent his process though. He was afraid someone else might steal his idea, which he was sure was a moneymaker. So he decided to take a different route. This time, he would get a partner. He writes a letter to Levi Strauss." They already had a business relationship because Jacob was ordering for, I think, over 2 years, ordering products from him. He says, "Listen, I invented this new thing. I don't have money for the patent. I'm willing to offer you 50% if you'll pay for all the stuff." Within like 3 weeks, Levi acts on this, and the deal is done. So it goes really fast. I'm going to skip ahead a little bit. I just want to give you this couple of sentences of the context of the time we're talking about and all the new inventions. It says, "In 1871 alone, 19,000 applications were submitted for new utilities or inventions to the patent office, 11,000 of these were granted. This was the era that saw the invention of the safety pin, the elevator, the typewriter, and the dynamite." I just love the idea that you can invent something and if it's revolutionary enough, it can stick around for hundreds of years because we use, well, I guess, the typewriter. We use a lot of those still.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Another -- skipping ahead a little bit because there's so many parts where, again, I keep using the metaphor of the gold rush as a way to think about like the Internet revolution that we're in right now. And so as anything, when there's a revolution, there's a high demand for services, right? So today, some of the highest paid labors, if that's what you want to call them, are programmers and engineers, right? I just -- I was listening to a podcast where they're saying that -- I think it was Reed Hastings of Netflix. He talked about that he wants fewer engineers, but he wants to pay them a lot. So he was even saying that he wants to pay Netflix engineers $1 million a year, right? So check this out. "Although garment production was expanding by the late 1860s, not everyone thought it was a good bet." Wages -- which is weird because listen to the subscription, "wages for the men and women who could cut and sew clothing were among the highest in the country due to a shortage of skilled labor. Women often worked out of their homes rather than in factories, but they still command a top dollar." And the next note I left myself is overnight success, 20 years in the making. It talks about Levi's tolerance for risk. It says, "Nothing in his actions indicates that he sought out risk for its own sake, but he knew the clothing business." So he was like, why would you do this for Jacob, right? "And he knew it from the hem up." Again, I think of -- that's why it's so important for us to share these stories because like if you're entrepreneur or founder, you really look at it like a craft. And it's something you study even when you're not working. It's something you just think about, you want to be good at whatever you're doing. I'm not saying you have to dedicate every waking moment to it. In fact, it's probably not a good idea, but it's -- if you're interested in something, depth is way more important than width.

So it says, when Levi's -- there you go, we're going to use that word now, "When Levi's deep knowledge of his customers' needs met Jacob's riveted pants, it's no wonder, Levi jumped out at the opportunity and made his decision so quickly. For 20 years, he had been importing and distributing a vast array of clothing and dry goods. By 1872, his retail base stretched from Montana, Nevada, Arizona, California and the Pacific Northwest to Canada, Mexico, Hawaii and Japan. He knew what kind of people needed what kind of clothing and where they needed it." So it's because he had already spent 20 years of his life learning about this industry that he was able to identify the opportunity to jump on it. And even though he was very successful, even if he never invented jeans, he'd be very successful. But even to this day, I think I looked it up yesterday, the Levi Strauss & Company is doing like $6 billion a year in sales. So the size and opportunity of creating this new pair of work pants, which is much larger than anything, the magnitude is larger than anything he was doing. This is an interesting idea of rebranding. "So when Levi and Jacob discussed their patent riveted pants, they knew they had to use a different word with their customers and in advertising. And that word was overalls. Today, this word conjures up the full-length denim garment with straps that buckle over the shoulders worn by farmers and country singers. But in 19th Century, overalls was a word that meant sturdy pants worn by cowboys, lumber jacks and other labors," labors like the people in the gold rush. "Levi and Jacob also understood that their product -- that the product they were about to put on the market was both familiar and new."

This is a really -- I love this part, like I love this idea. "So they understand that the product they put on the market was both familiar and new. Jacob, as a tailor, knew how to make a garment that men would want to wear that they were used to wearing. What was new was the rivets. Customers could see them there, reinforcing the pockets. But the pants were not so strange that men would not want to try them. The rivets were simply in addition to the typical work pants they were used to buying. And if the storekeeper did his job well, these customers would want to buy the riveted pants instead of the unriveted ones." It's a really interesting thought, if you're building a product or a service or a tool to think about how to make it both familiar and new. This is just a slight improvement on something that already existed and yet captures a huge percentage of the market and almost all the profits. What I mean about capturing profits, let's -- a few pages later, we're introduced to the healthy profit margin that Levi is used -- not used to, but it's going to experience with these plans. "Because of the rivets," and keep in mind, they're patented, so they're the only ones that can make it at least for 17 years, "and the additional labor time needed to apply them, the pants commanded top dollar. The wholesale price was $19.50 per dozen, with Levi Strauss & Company seeing between 33% and 40% in profit." And this next section is something we talk about all the time that books are the original hyperlinks. And I'm just going to read this because it was interesting to me. "So the New York Times publishes an article titled San Francisco Millionaires, a carefully prepared list of individuals and firms in San Francisco, whose repeated wealth exceeds $1 million." The writer referred to the individuals as towers of strength and Levi was listed as a millionaire in his own right. "Though the company was not listed, it was worth much, much more. Levi shared this millionaire list with a formidable collection of San Francisco personalities, whose interests represented nearly every enterprise that it shaped the city and to the great extent, the American West." So this is always fascinating to see how people at different times, how their fortunes are built, which is completely different from present day.

And I'm just going to let some of them, "They were the founders of the Bank of California. Also on the list were 2 of the Bonanza Kings, men who made fortunes in the Nevada silver rush". So the reason I said this is -- this section is about books are the original hyperlinks because there's names listed here, some of which I'm not listing just because there's so many of them and it's just no way -- it's too hard to remember them all. But I found some biographies on some of these people, and I've already ordered the books. So hopefully, some of these appear as future founder episodes. So it says, "The Bonanza Kings, who made fortunes in Nevada silver rush, the Cattle Kings whose wealth came from land and beef, the Presidents of Wells Fargo Bank who also had interest in water systems and mining." His name was Lloyd Tevis. In the 19th century, Tevis was the very definition of capitalist according to this article. There was also the founder who built the first iron foundry in San Francisco,, Union Iron Works. Oh, and this is interesting. And last but not least, Leland Stanford, who is one of the owners of the powerful Central Pacific Railroad, which would later be joined by the even more powerful Southern Pacific Railroad. And Stanford was later a President of the SP, had already been Governor of California, would later be a U.S. Senator and of course, would create the university that bears his name. So I found a few biographies on him that I ordered as well. Okay. So skipping that part. This is growing the GDP of the state and it talks about how Levi just had very narrow interests. "He didn't get involved in any business venture that was not tied to the development of the state or its industry. He also put his voice and his name to causes that would either further the expansion of trade or prevent it from being restricted." I mean we kind of know the end result that the jeans, they held the patent for 17 years, it built a massive company. So we've been talking about, hey, since a couple of hundred thousand dollars and it's worth millions of dollars in today's money.

And this sentence is really all we really need to know about the size of the business. And this is in their times dollars. So it doesn't translate what we mean in today's currency, but based on the other numbers in the book, it's hundreds of millions. "The introduction of the riveted clothing to the company's inventory contributed to mind-boggling sales of $3 million by the end of the 1870s." So order of magnitude more than he was doing. And this is something they had really good ideas. So there's not too much -- there's not too many examples of more numbers in the book besides the one I just told you. But I love this idea about branding and understanding your customer and communicating. And it made me think of the parallel to the podcast revolution that's happening right now. So let me get there first. So in the book, there's like most hardcover books, there's like pictures in the middle and they show some of the ads that Levi Strauss & Company did, and they're really interesting to look at. And so here's a description of one and why it's important. "In 1886, the leather patch on the overalls and other products were redesigned. In place of the company name, address and language about the patent was now an image, a finely drawn image of 2 horses each attached with harnesses to either side of the pair of riveted overall. A man with a whip stood next to each horse encouraging them to tear the pants apart, which is obviously a futile effort. Above the men and horses was a banner saying copper riveted. This 2-horse design was quickly registered as a trademark and was used on products and paper advertising and is still in use to this day."

And so I think a lot of us that may have been educated or read a lot or whatever the case is kind of take that fact into -- like I just assume everybody can. And the numbers are not at all clear. But you know there is a substantial amount of the population that either can't read at all or has difficulty reading. So the idea of the value of, hey, what is the value of putting Levi Strauss & Company if the people coming to the country do the gold rush can't read or speak another language, then they don't understand, but they understand an image, just like what the Gutenberg revolution in podcast is. There's a lot more people that are going to listen to something than read it. We know this. Look at the numbers of people, like even in America, like the average American, I think, reads like less than 1 book. The average person reads less than 1 book a year. And then the numbers from there is it's not that much better to the point where like people that read like more than 10 or 12 books a year, I think, are like 1% of the population. I think that's what the numbers, right? It's been a while since I saw it, but it's something like that. And to me, that's shocking because I told stories before, before my mom died of breast cancer last year. And one of the stores she always used to tell me is that even when I was a kid that I would like -- I would never not read. So I'd be eating cereal at the breakfast table and I've been reading the box of cereal, like I would just constantly read. So to me, it's like second nature, but that's just -- my opinion is kind of shaded by my own experiences like as it is for all of us. And so I don't know, I just think that's amazing how like podcasts give you the ability to understand information without having to read so much so that there is some company blogs I like to read, right? And I sent an e-mail to one of them a little while ago because I never think to look to check, but sometimes like maybe somebody tweets like an article from them and like, "Oh, c_*_, I really -- like I got some value out of there, whatever the case was." And so I e-mail them and I'm like, "Why don't you guys just make this like podcast, too? It takes no time to set up, like it could literally just be somebody there reading the article. I'd subscribe to the fee and I'd see everything you did."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I didn't get a response, but I think that's a really like -- I don't know, it's such a better idea. As much as I can, I'm trying to move most of my consumption to audio. I like it because I can be doing other things. Like I can be in the gym, I can go for a walk, I can be reading -- not reading, I can be driving. I don't know. Like to me, in 2018, it makes complete sense. If you have a company blog, again, you don't -- I'm not saying to replace it with an audio, just it should be a supplement to it. You don't even have to make another -- like a lot of people are using podcast for distribution, right? Like you don't even have to make and hire other people to do it. You literally already have the content right there. So I don't know, just the random thought. So let's see. Okay. So there's only a few other things I want to share with you. And-- okay. So this is kind of like an aphorism, and I think if you explain -- have to explain aphorism, it kind of loses a little bit of its value. And if you're listening to this, you're clearly smart enough to understand this, but I think this is kind of -- it's a great way to show some wisdom and personality that Levi had because he seems to be a very calm and methodical person. So let me just read that, and I'm not going to explain it. So I'm just going to let it linger. "Mr. Strauss was very quiet, affable, always immaculately dressed. Joe was really an admirer of him." So Joe was -- he was -- let's see, he was promoted to salesman, and he had most of California and part of Oregon in this territory. This is the guy Joe.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And now what I'm reading to is written up by another employee named Henry Richmond, who is writing up some informal remnants as slated in his life about Joe and about Levi. So this is Henry talking about an interaction that happened between Joe and Levi. "Mr. Strauss was very quiet, affable, always immaculately dressed. Joe was really an admirer of him. In 898," so this is towards the end of Levi's life because he dies, I think, in 1902, 1903. "In 1898, Joe was at the San Francisco headquarters, charging around to various department heads, intensely discussing and arguing. Mr. Strauss walked up to Joe and asked if he could see him in his office. When Joe was seated, he asked," meaning Levi asked, "Joe, did you have a good year? Joe proceeded to inform his boss what a fantastic year he had had. Mr. Strauss listened quietly and patiently until Joe finished and then he said, 'Remember, Joe, the more business you do, the more problems and trouble you have,' end of conversation. Xmas greetings were exchanged and Joe left. Joe never forgot that talk. He spoke of Mr. Strauss with great admiration every chance he could." And this is where I'll close the podcast, "During the week of September 22, Levi began to feel on well. On Wednesday, the 24th, he felt bad enough that doctors and a nurse were called to the house. Liver congestion was the diagnosis, and Levi was ordered to bed. By Friday, the 26th, he felt well enough to have dinner with the family -- with the rest of the family that evening." A nurse had been -- this is something before I finish this just paragraph -- we talked about something interesting to me and something I think we might have got away from at our own detriment was the entire life in that he -- for his entire life, from the time he went to San Francisco and his relatives started to join him later, and he had a lot of them, they all lived in the same house. They all worked in the same business. Levi employed all of his relatives. They all live together. They took care of each other.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

There was like 20 people living in Levi's house, including like -- he had like 8 or 10 nieces and nephews. And I don't know. I just -- I think that's a lot better arrangement than what we do now, where we kind of silo. We have a family and it kind of spreads on silos. I don't think that's a good idea. Okay. So it says, "He -- by Friday, he felt well enough to have dinner with the rest of the family that evening. A nurse had been in attendance earlier in the week and was still on hand as Levi went to bed around 8:00. A little while later, the nurse had heard him groaning. She went to his bedside and asked how he felt and he replied, 'Oh, about as comfortable as I can under the circumstances.' He then turned his head on his pillow and peacefully died."

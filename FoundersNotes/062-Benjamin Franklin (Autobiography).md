Imagining it may be equally agreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life, many of which you are yet unacquainted with, I sit down to write them for you. Having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and bred, to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the world and having gone so far through life with a considerable share of felicity – actually I had to look that word up, felicity means happiness. The conducing means I made use of my posterity may like to know, as they may find some of them suitable to their own situations, and therefore fit to be imitated.

Okay. So that's the beginning of the book that I want to talk to you about today, which is the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. And the part I just read you is actually a letter that he is writing to his son William. At the time, Ben is in his 60s. And he's kind of explicitly stating the goal of his autobiography, which is in parallel, the goal of this podcast. He's saying, hey, I've had a lot of fortunate experiences in my life. I've learned some things, and I'm going to tell you the things I learned, so that if you like them, if you find them agreeable, you can actually imitate and adapt into your own life. So if this is your first time listening to Founders, welcome, my name is David. The concept behind this podcast is pretty straightforward. Every week, I read a biography or an autobiography of an entrepreneur. And I just try to pull out ideas that we can all use in our life. So before we get into the rest of the book, it may seem a little strange that I picked Ben Franklin as a subject for a podcast on entrepreneurship. But he very much was an entrepreneur. So -- and I was talking about this idea that I think it's very useful to collect ideas because you never know when you're going to use them. Case in point is, I was -- several years ago, I was listening to or watching this podcast that used to exist. It's called Foundation. It was created by the founder of Digg, Kevin Rose.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And on the podcast, he actually is interviewing Elon Musk. And he asked Elon the question that you started companies really early, you were very young. How did you -- like did you read -- like how did you learn business? Like how did you -- did you read a lot of business books? And what Elon said -- the answer to that question stuck in my mind for several years, and it influenced my decision to start this podcast and he says, "I didn't read very many general business books. I like biographies and autobiographies. I think those are helpful.” He's -- then he talked about, he said, I liked both Franklin's autobiography, which is the book we're covering today and the biography by Isaacson, that's Walter Isaacson, the author. And then Elon elaborates like why -- like what's useful about learning about Ben Franklin. He says he was an entrepreneur. He started from nothing. He was basically a runaway kid. He created this printing business. He also did science and politics. He's one of the people I most admire. So I knew it was only a matter of time until I would do a podcast on this book. I also did a long time ago, before this podcast was just focused on entrepreneurs, I read Isaacson's book on Ben Franklin, did a podcast on it, but then I deleted it because I didn't know what direction to go in. So I may wind up rereading that and doing like a Benjamin Franklin part two. Well, for the meanwhile, the autobiography is a perfectly good tool to use to get some ideas directly from the mind of Ben Franklin. So I'm just going to move through. Some of these are going to be stories, some of these are going to be quotes. Like this is just an aphorism on vanity. And he says, “Most people dislike vanity in others, whatever share have of it themselves; but I give it a fair quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it is often productive of good to the possessor.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So let me read that sentence again. He says, “Most people dislike vanity in others, whatever share they have of it themselves.” So people don't like you to take pride in your own accomplishments, even though we all do that ourselves. We just don't want to display it hourly. “But I give it a fair quarter whenever I meet with it being persuaded that it is often productive of good to the possessor.” So he has a little counterintuitive point, saying, I understand you don't like this, but I actually think it's beneficial for people to be -- to have pride in their accomplishments. So I found that thought interesting. So I'm just going to jump -- now I'm going to jump into Ben's early education, his first job, and then memories of his father. And so he says, “My elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades. I was put to the grammar-school at eight years of age; my father intending to devote me to the service of the church. My early readiness in learning to read, which must have been very early, as I do not remember when I could not read, and the opinion of all his friends that I should certainly make a good scholar, encouraged him in the purpose of this.” Just a side note, Ben was the youngest child. His father had 17 kids. “I had risen gradually” -- so he's talking about once he’s in school. “I have risen gradually from the middle of the class of that year to be the head of it. But my father altered his first intention, took me from grammar-school, and sent me to a school for writing and arithmetic.” He did that for a year. “And then at ten years old I was taken home to assist my father in his business, which was that of a tallow-chandler and a soap-boiler.” So I guess he makes soap and candles. And he says, “Accordingly, I was employed in cutting wicks for the candles, filling the dripping mold -- or excuse me, the dipping mold and the molds for cast candles, attending the shop and going of errands, et cetera, et cetera.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“I disliked the trade.” So before he continues on the fact that he doesn't like the job he's doing, and he needs to find a different one. He has some -- this is how he's remembering his father many years after his father’s passing. He says, "I remember well him being frequently visited by leading people who consulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or of the church he belong to, and showed a good deal of respect for his judgment and advice. He was also much consulted by private persons about their affairs when any difficulty occurred and frequently chosen as an arbitrator between contending parties. And at his table, he like to have, as often as he could, some sensible friend or neighbor to converse with and always took care to start some ingenious or useful topic for discourse, which might tend to improve the minds of his children. By this means he turned our attention to what was good, just and prudent in the conduct of life.” So he likes to have interesting people to have intelligent discussions over at his house and he wants his kids in audience so they can learn from these discussions. So this is kind of like a mini-podcast, hundreds of years before they were invented. And so now we're going to learn how -- what Elon was saying, like how did Ben get his start in the printing business, and it had to come through several years of dealing with being under the thumb of his brother, which he did not appreciate, which causes them to run away, which Elon was mentioning earlier. But he's -- now he's talking, still working for his father, he says, “But my dislike to the trade continuing, my father was under apprehension that if he did not find one for me more agreeable, I should break away and get to sea.” So Benjamin Franklin had threatened multiple times that he’d just jump on a boat. They were living in Boston at the time, he’d go on to the port and he’d go for a life of adventure. So he says, "He, therefore, sometimes took me to walk with him, and see joiners, bricklayers.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And it says, “Seeing now” -- and then he is talking about the subscribers, “seeing now -- seeing a newspaper now in the hands of one who could also handle a pen,” which is very different from Bradford. So he gave another example of what Bradford was messing up on. Bradford was printing out like this public information for like the address and the contact information for the politicians, but he messed it up. He said, “He had printed an address of the house to the governor in a coarse, blundering manner. We reprinted it elegantly and correctly, and then send it to every member,” meaning every member of the government, “they were sensible of the difference.” And then that actually led them to changing. When they needed something printed professionally, they took the business from Bradford and gave it to Ben. But -- so he's doing well. His printing company is doing well, his newspaper is doing well, but he's almost ruined by debt. And debt is something he talks about at length. I think he mentions it like 10 to 15 times in this book. And this book is rather short. It's 110 pages is paperback version. So he's mentioning it every 10 or 11 pages. So he says, “But now another difficulty came upon me, which I never the least reason to expect. Mr. Meredith’s father,” -- which is his business partner, the dad who put up the money, “who was to have paid for a printing house, according to the expectations given me, according to what I thought, was able to advance only 100 pounds currency, which had been paid, but 100 more was due to the merchant who grew inpatient and sued us.” “We gave bail but saw that if the money could not be raised at the time, the suit must come soon to a judgment and execution and the execution of that judgment means that I would have ruined us as the press and letters would have been sold for payment perhaps at half the price.” So he has two kind friends who agreed to lend him the money to get them out from this happening.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Now he's just -- this is just a list of occupations that were in their town, “Joiners, bricklayers, turners, braziers, et cetera, at their work, that he might observe my inclination and endeavor to fix it on some trade or other on land.” So that was his goal. He -- one of his other sons, Josiah, had left to a life on the sea, and it really -- he says, it caused him great fixation, which just means he p***** them off. Okay. So he says, “From a child, I was fond of reading and all the little money that came into my hands was ever laid out in books.” So keep in mind, Benjamin Franklin did not have much like organized education. He's widely self-taught through just reading and talking to people. He said, “My father's library, a little library consisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity, most of which I read. I have since often regretted that, at a time when I had such a thirst for knowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way, since it was now resolved that I should not be a clergyman.” Remember what he's referencing there is his dad originally thought, hey, I’m going to have -- his occupation is going to be one of the church and then he changed routes. So he is like, why did I read all these books. At a young age, it's so much easier to read. I'm reading books that I'm not going to use in my life, is basically what he's saying. He says, “This bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a printer.” So he already had his older son, James, was in that profession. “So in 1717, my brother James returned from England with a press and letters to set up his business in Boston. I liked it much better than that of my father,” meaning the business. “In a little time I made a great proficiency in the business and became a useful hand to my brother. I now had access to some better books. An acquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes to borrow a small one, which I was careful to return soon, and clean. Often, I sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night, when the book was borrowed in the evening and had to be returned early in the morning, lest it should be missed or wanted.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he's basically saying he had such a desire to learn that he would forgo sleep just because he only had a tiny window in which to read these books. So we're also going to see -- while he's working for James, he has entrepreneurial tendencies right from the get-go. And he's very, very young. I don't even think he is a teenager at this point. And then he also talks about something that – and something I also have been noticing with a lot of the notes I've been taking for Founders notes is these entrepreneurs always talk about like there's some kind of like a side thing that benefited them had like a roundabout benefit later in life. So one example like this guy wanted to become an entrepreneur, he's had a full-time day job. So he just blogged and blogged and blogged, he started writing about all the stuff he was learning. And then eventually, that opened up for him to start a conference, start other businesses, start podcasts, which then kind of just fed into this like virtuous cycle. So Ben Franklin is going to talk a little bit about that here with the power of writing, which basically, fundamentally changed his life. It's probably why it's so well-known, it's based on his writing. So first seed of entrepreneurial tendency is, he says, “When they were” -- he started like writing just like little stories and stuff. He called it wretched stuff, just like street-ballad-style stories. But since his brother was a printer and he worked at a printing company, he started printing them. He said, “When they were printed, he sent me about the town to sell them. The first sold wonderfully, the event being recent, having made great noise. This flattered my vanity.” So this, again, goes back to that whole point of vanity where he had a really early initial success selling his books and that made him more confident to go off and do other things. So that's what I think he was mentioning with that quote earlier, that aphorism on vanity, it's like, no, don't indulge yourself but understand that you're capable of learning new things. And then when you have a success like this, like let her reinforce you to try to do other things, which I think is a good idea.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he says, “Writing has been of great use to me in the course of my life and was a principal means of my advancement.” So at this point, he started -- he -- Benjamin Franklin is not only known for writing under his own name, but he wrote under several different pseudonyms. And so this is the very beginning of this. And so he says, “My brother had begun to print a newspaper. It was the second that appeared in America. I remember him being dissuaded by” -- oh, this is actually really funny. We always talk about how critics -- like any time you're going to create something new, you expect to be criticized, expect that people are resistant to change and they don't really know what they're talking about. So don't -- that doesn't mean like you can't get good constructive criticism, but just understand that some criticism is unfounded. Its people aren't really looking deeply into things before they comment on it. They're just battling away. So his brother runs into this in 1720, where he wants to, as I said, "Yes, I'm going to start a newspaper. There's already one, why not isn't there a second one?” And listen to how ridiculous now this criticism is going to be with our benefit of hindsight. “I remember him being dissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking as not likely to succeed” And the reason why it won't succeed, “One newspaper being in their judgment enough for America.” So anyway, he continues on, he doesn't let this criticism bother him. He starts the newspaper and Benjamin Franklin says, I was employed to carry the papers through the streets to the customer. So another one of his first jobs is newspaper delivery boy. So some people would write little pieces for the paper. They put it under the door of the printer, and they would read it. And if they thought it was good enough, they print in the newspaper. And a lot of them were written under like fake names. So Ben is like, hey, I want to write, like my brother is not going to take it seriously, if his little brother has these ideas, let me operate under pseudonym.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he says, “I was excited to try my hand among them, but still being a boy and suspecting that my brother would object to printing anything of mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine, I can try to disguise my hand and writing an anonymous paper, I put it in, at night, under the door of the printing house. It was found in the morning.” And so in the next morning, Ben's there when they all find this and they're all reading and commenting on it. And he says they read it, commented on it in my hearing, which means, he heard it. And I had the exclusive pleasure of finding it met with their approbation -- and that in their different guesses as the author, none were named, but men of some character among us for learning and ingenuity.” So while they're trying to guess who it was, they're just rattling off people that are well respected. So that gave him even more confidence because like, oh, that's nice. I'm kind of in peers with these people. So this doesn't last long though because Ben and James, like James is kind of a jerk to him a little bit, didn't like -- Ben got a lot of attention because of his like pretty obvious advanced intellect at such a young age. And there's all these other -- these things talked about in the book, but James looked at Ben like an indentured servant and Ben wasn't the kind of person that wanted to be controlled by anybody. So he says -- so he is like, I'm out of here. “So I sold some of my books to raise a little money and was taken on board privately.” He jumps on a ship to New York. “In three days, I found myself in New York, nearly 300 miles from home. A boy of but 17 without the knowledge of any person in the place and with very little money in my pocket.” So that's what Elon was talking about. So he was a runaway kid, he had to start from nothing. He had literally nothing. But having a trade and supposing myself a pretty good workman, I offered my services to the printer in the place. So he meets the printer. Printer is like, listen, I can't. I don't have any business for you, but I know of somebody in Philadelphia, and he says, he could give me no employment having little to do.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he decides, hey, like, why don't you come work with me? Like get out of this printing business, and I'll teach you how to be a merchant or what we would call today, an entrepreneur. And so Ben comments on this. He says, “He now told me he was about to return of Philadelphia and should carry over a great quantity of goods in order to open a store there. He proposed to take me over as his clerk, to keep his books, in which he would instruct me, copy his letters and attend the store. I now took leave of printing.” And this is interesting, how like the future is never predictable because listen to what Ben says here, “As I thought, forever.” So he thought he was done with the world of printing forever. Keep in mind, obviously, that's not true. That's how he makes his fortune. “And was daily employed in my new business, going about among the tradesmen to purchase various articles.” And so now he's going around buying all these things with his new boss. And they're about to leave back to America. And Ben is just kind of reflecting on that. He says, “Thus, I spent about 18 months in London. Most part of the time I worked hard on my new business and spent but little upon myself except in seeing plays and in books. But I had picked up some very ingenious acquaintance whose conversation was of great advantage to me, and I had read considerably.” So he's talking about the guy that he hired. And he is like, listen, I didn't make much progress. I worked a lot, only spend money on plays and books, but now I've actually made an acquaintance that's going to be very helpful to me. And it was. They get back to Philadelphia and he says, "I respected and loved him, and we might have gone on together very happy.” But then this guy gets sick, this happens only like a year after they get back to Philadelphia, a year or two after being back. And he said, “the sickness held on to him for a long time and at length, carried him off,” meaning killed him. The store was then taken into the care of his executors of his will and my employment under him ended.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But he says, "My son at Philadelphia has lately lost his principal hand, the person working for him died. And if you go over there, I believe he may employ you. So Ben just does just that, he says, all right, well, I'm not going to stay in New York, there's no work for me. And this is his humble arrival in Philadelphia as he remembers it. He says my first, and this is really interesting because he's definitely accused of having some vanity of his own, but I would argue that it's probably deserved. So he says, "My first entry into that city that you may, in your mind, compare such unlikely beginnings with the figure I have since made there. I was dirty from my journey. My pockets were stuffed out with shirts and stockings, and I knew no soul nor where to look for lodging. I was fatigued with traveling, rowing and want of rest. I was very hungry. And my whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch dollar and about a shilling in copper.” So he's just walking the street trying to get -- to figure out what's going on in this town. And he says, "I went up Market Street as far as Fourth Street, passing by the door of Mr. Reed.” And then a little twist of fate here, “I pass by the door of Mr. Reed, my future wife’s father when she” -- his future wife, “standing at the door saw me and thought I made, as I certainly did, a most awkward and ridiculous appearance.” So he actually meets the governor of the new area he's in. And well, first of all, let me tell you, so there's two printers in Philadelphia and he goes to see both of them. The first one that he was told to go was this guy named Bradford. So he says, "These two printers, I found poorly qualified for their business.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“Bradford had not been bred to it and was very illiterate and Keimer, though something of a scholar was a mere compositor, knowing nothing of presswork. So this part is important because he's really identifying what he feels -- he was going into business and competing directly with both of these guys. And he's kind of telling you like his competitive analysis of why eventually, he's going to compete with them and why he thinks he is going to win what he does. So he talks about -- this is something that's mentioned in the book multiple, multiple times, mentioned in many, many of the books that we've covered so far. And so during this time, he said he was gaining money by my industry, meaning hard work, and frugality. Okay. So now he goes to work for Keimer and he's being industrious, he's being frugal, and he's still dedicated to continuous learning. And so people hear about this young guy who is reading all the time. And so he actually meets the governor of the province, and he comes and calls on Ben. He wants to know who this new young man is. He says, “He said I appeared a young man of promising parts and therefore, should be encouraged. The printers of Philadelphia were wretched ones and if I would set up there, he made no doubt that I should succeed.” So he puts this little corn of idea into Ben's mind. And he also gives him a promise, he proposed, “My setting up of my business laid before me the probabilities of success.” Saying, hey, like the printers here kind of suck, you could do better. And not only can you do better, but I will help set you up. So now this guy winds up being a liar. But Ben doesn't really like hold it against him even though what he does to Ben is kind of messed up. Well, he just says, hey, he doesn’t have much means. So since he can't provide means he provides people hope, but it's a false hope.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he says, "Hey, I'm going to set you up. I'm going to like make sure you get the credit you need.” And he says, why don't you go to England and pick out all the parts that you need to become a printer. And so he's like, I'm going to send you a letter of credit and a few days before the journey, he's waiting on it. He’s like, oh, no, I'm busy. I'll hand to you tomorrow. Then the morning comes, and Ben is about to depart, he’s like, oh, I send it on the ship, never arrives. So in the meantime, though, it's just a good example of some great grandmother wisdom here. And this happened on the boat toward to England, and he befriends this elderly woman, a grandmother, just being nice to her. And remember, he's very young, 17, 18 years old at this time, doesn't know much of the world, he’s now traveling abroad, and he -- there’s two young women on the boat that are paying him attention, and he's like, oh, this is great. This is fantastic. But the grandmother pulls him aside, and is like, listen, I need to school you on what's going on here, guy. He says, when she saw a daily growing familiarity between me and the two young women, which they appear to encourage, she took me aside and said, "Young man, I'm concerned for thee, as thou has no friend with thee, and seems not to know much of the world, or of the snares, youth is exposed to. Depend on it, those are very bad women. I can see it in their actions. And if you are not on your guard” -- I'm translating from this old English like thee trying to translate in real time for you. “But if you're not on your guard, they will draw you into some danger. They are strangers to you, and I advise you in a friendly concern for your welfare to have no acquaintance with them.” And so this grandmother wind up being correct, they were trying to set him up to rob him.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

They did the same thing for the captain of the ship. And then once they got to England, they were actually caught basically seducing men and stealing their possessions is what they were doing. Okay. So skipping ahead a little bit. This is where he learns the dangers of vice, and he's just got a -- and then he's just got a great quote. Okay. So he runs into his childhood friend Collins. And when they were growing up, they were two of the most like studious young people in the little town they lived in and they read a bunch of books, they would engage in intellectual debate or just kind of talking over whatever ideas and then sharing ideas. But now he pops up later on in life, and it says, “But during my absence,” -- his name is Collins. “He had acquired a habit of sotting with brandy. And I found by his own account and from what I heard from others that he had been drunk every day. He had gambled too and lost his money. Collins wish to be employed in some counting-house, but whether they discovered his dramming by his breath,” meaning the fact that he was drunk because it was on his breath, “or by his behavior, he met with no success. He continued lodging and boarding at the same house with me and in my expense.” So his friend is not only drunk, but he has no money, can't get a job because he continues to be -- to give in to his vices and is borrowing money liberally from Benjamin. And he says promising repayment as soon as he should be in the business. So they wind up getting into a bit of an argument. They were drunk one day or not, Ben wasn't drunk, but Collins was drunk. And they were with a group of other people rowing a boat across the water. And for some reason, Collins decided that, hey, I don't have to row, you guys have to take care of me. And so there's a huge argument because it's just more crappy, selfish behavior. And Collins decides to take off for the West Indies.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And before he leaves, he tells Ben, “He left me then promising to remit me the first money he should receive in order to discharge his debt. I never heard from him again.” So again, kind of getting a crash course in human nature here. And then there's just a great quote on the very next page, and it says, “There was great difference in persons and discretion did not always accompany years nor was youth always without it.” So this -- the context of this discussion is that this governor wants to set him up in business even though Ben is young. His father hears about it and doesn't want Ben to do it because he says, hey, like Ben's too young to run a business. And the response was, well, yes, like -- but there's a great difference in the quality of people, and it doesn't always get better with age. Okay. So this is what I was mentioning earlier, where he finds -- now he gets -- he lands in England, and he finds out the governor is unreliable. So he realizes, hey, there's no letters here. I don't know how I'm going to buy these things, I don't have any money. So he says, “I began to doubt his sincerity. I found my friend Denham and opened up the whole affair to him. He led me into Keith's character,” that's the governor's name, “told me there was not the least probability that he had written any letters for me; that no one who knew him had the smallest dependence on him; and he laughed at the notion of the governor giving me a letter of credit, having, as he said, no credit to give.” So now Ben is worried, he's like, what should I do? And so his friend says, his friend advises, “He advised me to endeavor getting some employment in the way of my business, meaning the printing business, among the printers here, you will improve yourself and when you return to America, you will set up to greater advantage.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he does exactly that. He gets a relatively low-paying job, finds -- so he finds work and he finds shelter. And the problem was though that he -- basically, he's used to being frugal and squirreling away and saving money, but the cost of living in London at the time was so expensive and his wages were not keeping up with it. And he says, “Our expenses,” he has a friend with him. “Because of our expenses,” he was actually lending money to another friend. “I was constantly kept unable to pay my passage.” So the moral of the story is the lower your cost, the more freedom you have. So it says -- and then this is how he stumble. The good thing though is he's not able to save much money during this time, he is gaining experience, but he's gaining a lot of knowledge because there's a library next door or a bookseller next door rather that becomes his own personal library. So he said, "I made an acquaintance with one Wilcox, a bookseller, whose shop was at the next door.” And he said, “I might take, read and return any of his books. This I esteemed a great advantage, and I made as much use of it as I could.” So the reason I keep putting this -- pulling these quotes out is because we have a lot easier today, like we carry around the sum of human knowledge in our pockets. But Ben talked about one advantage that he had over just regular persons was his desire to constantly improve and to learn about -- not only to develop more skills for himself, but to learn about the natural world. That's why you did experiments in science. He made all these different inventions, all of which he will refuse patent and copyrights on because he thought that like you should share knowledge freely. But I just think it's important, like this guy obviously lived an amazing life. And if he's telling you over and over again that, hey, this was a huge advantage to me, a huge advantage to me. I think more of us should take heed. I think I talked about this, this week, and I'll talk more about at the end, how now I have a daily podcast and how to get access to that, if you want.

But I talked about it on my daily podcast this week, I saw -- I think it was a tweet that says the Internet is widening the gap between those that want to learn and those that want to be entertained. And what I took that to mean is like there's a near limitless supply to learn whatever you want, whatever you want to read about, whatever you want to listen podcasts on, videos, lectures, et cetera. And so some of us are taking advantage of it, right? Most of the people listening to podcasts, obviously, like these, like the one I'm doing is obviously taking advantage of it. But the dark side or the downside to that is you could also just entertain yourself to death with just mindless entertainment. You just sit there watching c_*_ all day and you could do that forever. So you just have to be really careful not -- like what path you want to choose. To me, I want to choose the path of people like Ben Franklin, like I want to know more five years from now than I know today and 50 years from now than I know today if I'm lucky enough to live that long. So this is -- so he's working with a bunch of English guys at a printing press. It's like partially physical labor at the time. It's just how the technology worked. But I thought this little story was a really good look into how the mind of Ben Franklin worked. So he said, "I took to working at the press, imagining I felt a want of the bodily exercise I've been used to in America.” So he wants that physical movement. “I drink only water; the other workmen were great guzzlers of beer.” They said they drink strong beer. So he says, “My companion at the press drank every day a pint before breakfast, a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese, a pint between breakfast and dinner, a pint at dinner, a pint in the afternoon about six O'clock, and another when he had done his day's work.” So let me read this quote before I get into the rest of the story, so you can keep this in mind because he has this great idea, I think we're not -- he picked up 300 years ago, however long it's been, that we’re not really rational creatures. We're rationalizing creatures.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he says, “So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.” So you're just really justifying your behavior, you're going to see that here with this drunk guy. So he says, “I thought it was a detestable custom, but it was necessary, he supposed to drink strong beer that he may be strong to labor.” So he's telling Ben, the reason he's doing this because it makes me strong, what are you talking about? So he says -- this is the way Ben’s mind works though which I find so interesting. “I endeavored to convince him that the bodily strength afforded by beer could only be in proportion to the grain or flour of the barley dissolved in the water of which it was made,” meaning he's breaking it down to its material constituents, right? “That there was more flour in a pennyworth of bread; and, therefore, if you would eat that with a pint of water, it would give him more strength than a quart of beer.” And what do you think the result of that was, “He drank on, however, and had four or five shillings to pay out of his wages every Saturday night for that muddling liquor, an expense I was free from. And thus, these poor devils keep themselves always under.” All right. So now he has a new job. He gets recruited by this merchant. This guy was from England, went to Pennsylvania. He was basically broke when he arrived in Pennsylvania. He starts a -- what today would be like a retail business, like he buys things other people made, marks it up a little bit, and then sells it to the end customer, right? And he leaves England in kind of disgrace not paying his debt, he makes all his money in Philadelphia. Now he's coming back to England. This is where Ben meets him, and he's coming back to pay all of his debts with interest. But he's only stopping there to grab some more stuff from England and go back to Philadelphia to his business.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So now he's got to figure out what is going on. Like what am I going to do? Now I'm back in Philadelphia, and he's like, maybe I should just -- maybe I should just go back to Boston. So before he thinks about going back to Boston, he goes back to work for one of the printers, Keimer. They get into an argument so Ben leaves, but they wind up reconciling. But in between this, there's was a guy name Meredith that's working with him, and Meredith is actually helpful of getting Ben a stay in Philadelphia. So he says, “He dissuaded me from returning to my native country.” It's funny, they call it countries. He's talking about the city of Boston, which I began to think of. He reminded me that Keimer was in debt for all he possessed, that his creditors began to be uneasy and that he kept his shop miserably. He sold often without profit for ready money and often trusted without keeping accounts, that he must, therefore, fail, which would make a vacancy, I might profit of.” Okay? So it says, hey, this is -- like you know these facts to be true. Keimer doesn't know what he's doing. My father would finance, give us like the seed capital we need to start a printing company and if we become partners. So Ben and Meredith become partners. He says, “The proposal was agreeable, and I consented. His father was in town and approved of it. He saw that I had great influence with his son.” So he wanted his son to be around Ben because Ben avoided vices and his son was a drunk, another drunk. So he says, “I gave an inventory to the father who carried it to a merchant and the things were sent for. The secret was to be kept until they arrive. So they keep working at Keimer but they're not going to tell him they're going to compete with him until they actually have the equipment. And so during this time, there's a bunch of people -- Keimer is also a little jealous of Ben because a lot of people come to the printing house and like call on Ben. And Ben has this idea. He's like, "Well, my mind,” -- and I love the way he puts this.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

When my daughter sees me reading, I’m going to start saying this. “My mind having been much more improved by reading than Keimer’s, I suppose it was for that reason, my conversations seem to be more valued.” So he is talking in the context that it's getting invited to these dinners or these taverns, where people want to talk to him. So next time somebody sees you're reading say, what are you doing? Like I'm improving my mind. And so one of these guys -- he's basically Ben is becoming acquainted with all like the older, like more successful people in Philadelphia and one of them tells him, then he doesn't know he's going to set up his own printing company, so it's kind of like prophetic, but he says, I foresee that you will soon work this man out of business and make a fortune in it in Philadelphia. So Keimer was not very respected. Okay. I have a note, and this is confusing, sometimes I leave notes for myself, I don't know what I'm talking about. So I left the note croakers everywhere and now I have to read over all my highlights because I have no idea what I'm talking about. So let me jump into this. Okay, so he's already opened -- he's already open for business at this time. So he says, “We had scarce opened our letters and put our press in order before an acquaintance of mine brought a countryman to us, whom he had met in the street inquiring for a printer.” So this random guy was walking around, said he need a printer, Ben’s friend is like, hey, I'll walk you over there. This country -- and this is a really interesting point, or I guess feeling, I would say. “This countryman’s 5 shillings being our first fruits,” meaning the first revenue into the company, and “coming so seasonably,” meaning when they needed it, “gave me more pleasure than any crown I have since earned.” So Ben is a very, very, very wealthy person by the time he's writing this and he's saying, that all the money I’ve stacked does not give me this much pleasure as the first bit of money I made when I first started my company. Bless him.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I have since earned and the -- so any crown I've since earned and the gratitude I felt toward his acquaintance that brought him his first business has made more -- has made me often more ready than perhaps I should otherwise have been to assist young beginners. So that's Ben Franklin saying something we talk about a lot that if you want to vote with your dollars and you have the opportunity to spend with a company that's run by a person, the founder as opposed to this giant faceless conglomerate like try to spend money with the individuals because those are the people that need your help, not these giant companies that are usually far away from their actual customers’ well-beings. And he's saying that I've otherwise been able to assist young beginners. We need more small businesses. We need more entrepreneurship, not less. The wages, speaking for my own country, the wage in this country for the middle class have been stagnant for 40 years. Nobody is coming to save you. Politicians don't -- they don't care about you. There's nothing they can do. The only thing -- like you can only save yourself and that opportunity is through creating a product and selling that product to other people and then repeating it over and over again. So in anyways, I just think what Ben is saying here is extremely important. And any chance you can to support the people that are actually creating stuff that you like. All right. So there are croakers in every country -- okay, now this -- okay, this makes sense now. So a croaker is just like a critic, like a jerk, like a pessimist. So he's going to tell us a story about one. So my note croakers everywhere is now making sense to me. “There are croakers in every country, always boding its ruin.” “Such one then lived in Philadelphia, a person of note, an elderly man with a wise look and a very grave manner of speaking. This gentleman, a stranger to me, stopped one day at my door and asked me if I was the young man who had lately opened a new printing house. Being answered in the affirmative, he said he was sorry for me because it was an expensive undertaking, and the expense would be lost for Philadelphia was a sinking place.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The people already have bankrupt or near being so, even though all appearances to the contrary. And this is what Ben makes the point is like, that's weird, like what's up with all these new buildings and the rising of rents then. “So being to a certain knowledge false for they were, in fact, among the things that would soon ruin us.” So when Ben brings this up, he’s saying, no, that's fake, right? And so he says, “And he gave me such a detail of misfortunes now existing, or they were soon to exist that he left me half melancholy.” So it’s another example of why you should avoid pessimistic people. They're just not fun to talk to you. “Had I known him before I engaged in this business, probably I never should have done it. This man continued to live in this decaying place and to declaim in the same strain, refusing for many years to buy a house there because all was going to destruction.” So just doesn't want to buy anything because why would I buy into places going bankrupt. “And at last, I had the pleasure of seeing him give five times as much for one house as he might have bought it for when he first began his croaking.” Okay. So now he's going to talk about how he believes the industry is virtuous and then we're going to get into knowing the right way to do something by seeing it done the wrong way. So there's people in town that are of the general opinion. He says, general opinion was that it must fail, meaning his business. Because there's already two printers in the place. And then -- but there's this guy, Dr. Baird, who knew Ben, and he gives a contrary opinion, and this is Dr. Baird’s words. He says, “For the” -- so he gives him a contrary opinion, “For the industry of that, Franklin,” says he, “is superior to anything I ever saw of the kind; I see him still at work when I go home from the club, and he is at work again before his neighbors are out of bed. I mentioned this industry, the more particularly and the more freely,” – this is Ben talking again, “though it seems to be talking in my own praise.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he is saying, listen, I'm telling you about my industry, not just because I'm like self-regret and aggrandizing. But because those of my posterity, meaning my descendants, who shall read it, may know the use of that virtue, meaning industry is virtuous. “When they see its effects in my favor throughout this relation,” when they see that -- what industry brought to my life. I soon intended to begin a newspaper. “My hopes of success were founded on this that the only newspaper printed by Bradford at the time was a paltry thing, wretchedly managed, no way entertaining and yet was profitable to him. I therefore thought a good paper would scarcely fail.” So he sees this guy doesn’t even know what he is doing is making a profit, like why would we assume that if I make a better product, I can also make a profit. And then -- so he says, one of our -- so he starts the newspaper, and he goes out and he's trying to get subscribers, people to pay for the information that he's printing for them. So he says, “Our first papers made quite a difference appearance from any before in the province. It had a better type, it was better printed and some spirited remarks -- and it had spirited remarks of my writing.” So he's writing on the dispute that's taking place between some people in the local government, a governor, and an assembly men. So while this dispute is going on, Ben is writing in his own newspaper and he's giving like pithy opinions. He calls them spirited remarks. But what happened was people were like, it wasn't bland, so people were drawn to it. So he said, occasioned the paper and the manager of it to be much talked of, meaning himself. And in a few weeks, brought them all to be our subscribers. So this -- like the way he is with -- his skill with the pen is bringing him more subscribers. Basically he's telling us that he would have been great on Twitter.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then Meredith realizes, hey, I'm kind of like useless, I'm not good at the skill, I want to go back into the country and become a farmer. So Ben reincorporates, and he's now the sole proprietor of his business and therefore, in control. And then a story on the page -- a few pages later just kind of tells me that Ben understood branding, what we would call branding today. And so he says, “In order to secure my credit and character as a tradesmen, I took care not only to be really industrious and frugal,” those are other words again, “but to avoid all appearances to the contrary, I dressed plainly; I was seen at no places of idle diversion. I would -- to show that I was not above my business, I sometimes brought home the paper I purchased at the stores through the streets on a wheelbarrow.” So he's buying them at the store, but then he's pushing them through the sheet on the wheelbarrow to make it look like he's out delivering papers. “Thus being esteemed as industrious -- as an industrious, thriving young man and paying duly for what I brought, the merchants who imported stationary solicited my custom,” meaning they saw I'm doing this, and they started -- this branding gave him more business. So they solicited my custom, and they propose -- they also proposed supplying me with books and I went on swimmingly. In the meantime, Keimer’s credit and business declining daily, he was at last forced to sell his printing house to satisfy his creditors. He went to Barbados and there lived some years in very poor circumstances. So now there was three, now there's two. The person that Ben used to work for, and they had correctly predicted that, hey, this guy -- he's so bad at running business. It's a matter of time till he fail, so it's going to open opportunities for us. They wind up being correct on that.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And this was actually really fascinating. So he's got a ton of achievements, right, more than we could even list here. But one of the things that he did, which I didn't know, is he created the country's -- America's first subscription library. So he says, "I used to establish the Philadelphia Public Library, which from a small beginning, has now grown to become considerable. At the time I established myself in Pennsylvania, there was not a good bookseller shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston. Those who love reading were obliged to send for their books from England. I proposed that we should all bring us -- that we should all…” So okay, first of all, let me back up because he has this thing, and I love this idea, and it's called the Junto and it starts off as a small club of different tradesmen from all different backgrounds, blacksmiths, printers, writers, all kinds of people. And he organizes, even though he's like the youngest one, he's like the leader of it and he starts off with like a dozen people and then grows to a lot more than that to like different clubs all over the country. But basically, they just meet, they all read books, they all like have different ideas. They're all trying to continue to learn. And so they meet. And then they discuss like the business of the day. So not only are they giving them tips to like how they're running their businesses because they are all merchants, but like they talk about philosophy and science and literature and all those other different -- these different things. It's also a great product name. I kind of wish I called Founders as Junto if I had known this before. But so anyways, he already has this going, and he's like, I propose to them, meaning the people in Junto that we should all bring our books to one room where they would not only be ready to consult in our conferences, meaning these conversations.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And it's fascinating, like you can go online and see like the list of questions. So before they would talk, they would like have questions that would like basically be meant to spur in the discussion. So he says, let's bring all of our books in this year into one room where we have these conferences. So not only can we consult them in conferences, but they could become a common benefit, each of us being at liberty to borrow such as he wish to read at home. So finding the advantage of this little collection, I propose to render the benefit from books more common, meaning making it more accessible to everybody. If this is benefiting us, why won't -- like there's no way, there's only 12 people that would be benefiting from this by commencing a public subscription library. So few, the readers at the time in Philadelphia, and the majority of us so poor that was not able without great industry to get to find more than 50 persons, mostly young tradesmen willing to pay down for the purpose 40 shillings each and then 10 shillings each year. So 40 shillings to get started, 10 shillings each year, and we can all have access to this information. But we always talk about all big things start small. And it's an example of that. On this little fund, we began. The books were imported. The library was opened one day in the week for lending to the subscribers and then they had promissory notes to pay double the value if the book wasn’t returned. The institution soon manifested its utility, was imitated by other towns and in other provinces. The libraries were augmented by donations, reading became fashionable and our people, having no public amusements to divert their attention from study, became better acquainted with books, and in a few years, were observed by strangers to be better instructed and more intelligent than people of the same rank generally are in other countries. I thought that was one, surprising, and two, really, really cool. And so he says, “This library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study for which I set apart an hour or two each day and thus repaired in some degree, the loss of the learned education my father once intended for me.”

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

“Reading was the only amusement I would allow myself. I spent no time in taverns, games or frolics of any kind, and my industry and my business continued as indefatigable as it was necessary. My circumstances, however, grew daily easier, my original habits of frugality continuing.” So when I read that part about, hey, like I just devoted myself to business because I enjoyed it, and then I spent my other time reading, first, that sounds like a good idea, right, especially if you enjoy it because then it's going to -- it's actually really fun, what some people might feel as laborious is like fun for you. But this whole thing is like I did this for a long time, but my circumstances, however, grew daily, easier, my original habits of frugality continuing. This reminds me of a few weeks ago, we talked about John Bogle, founder of Vanguard and he has this great quote. And I do realize like what he's talking about, that why is Ben Franklin's life getting easier. The more the -- everyday that he's able to be responsible with his resources, which to me is it's really just a definition of frugality, right? Just being responsible. Why is it easier in life as opposed to being harder? And it's because just like he's avoiding, I'm going to use John Bogle’s quote here to illustrate this. This is what frugality avoids. “Keep your expenses low for the tyranny of compounding costs can devastate the miracle of compounding returns.” Ben Franklin is keeping his compounding cost low, so he can enjoy the upside of compounding returns, and so a little while longer. This biography was written over, I think, like 1.5 decades. I don't have the actual years in front of me, but he wrote it -- he sat down to write it four different times. And so it jumps around a little bit.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But -- and I think the last time -- it's actually unfinished because the last sentence isn’t even finished, and he dies like a year or two after that. So he never actually completed it. But the reason I bring that up is because after he's already successful in business and he's kind of venturing out to different things, he has this idea that he wants to be -- he is composing a list of virtue. So I just want to go through this list real quick. So he says, “It was about this time that I conceived the bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection.” So he winds up not -- obviously, you can't achieve perfection, but he's very satisfied. Well, I'm jumping ahead. Let me just read you the list of 13 virtues that he tracked. He actually had like a -- would be like a rudimentary spreadsheet that he wrote out and he would write what days he adhered to these virtues and what days he didn't. So the names of these virtues with their precepts were -- so he just lists them, and he describes them. Number one, temperance: eat not to dullness, drink not to elevation. Two, silence: speak not but what may benefit others or yourself, avoid trifling conversation. Three, order: let all your things have their places, let each part of your business have its time. Number four, resolution: resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.” So I guess, do what you say you're going to do. “Number five, frugality: make no expense but to do good to others or yourself, waste nothing. Number six, industry: lose no time. Be always employed in something useful, cut off all unnecessary actions.” I wonder what he you would think about social media and the modern like distraction we all carry around with us. “Seven, sincerity: use no hurtful deceit, think innocently and justly and if you speak, speak accordingly.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Number eight, justice: wrong none by doing injuries or omitting the benefits of your duty. Number nine, moderation: avoid extremes, forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve. Number ten, cleanliness: tolerate no uncleanliness in the body, clothes or habitation. Number 11, tranquility: be not disturbed at trifles or at accidents common or unavoidable. Number 12, chastity: rarely use venery for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness or for the injury of your own or another’s peace or reputation and number 13, humility: imitate Jesus and Socrates.” And so he's reflecting now here on -- he did this for a long time. He talks about as he got older, sometimes he would track it every day. Sometimes he would -- like he’d go from every day to every week to every month. But he says, eventually, you just stopped doing it, he says, "I never arrived at the perfection I had been so ambitious of obtaining but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the endeavor, a better and happier man than I otherwise should have been if I had not attempted it.” So when I read that, he's saying, okay, I wanted perfection and realized I couldn't achieve it but even though I didn't hit my goal, I still felt better and happier that I did it. One of my favorite words of all time is this word called autotelic. And autotelic is just something that has an end or purpose in and of itself. So he was doing this activity for the sake of doing it. Even if you say you have another goal, like you just enjoyed it so much that you just do it because you want to do it. So I just love that. So now he's just going to close out a little bit reflecting on what it's like to be 79 years old.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And he says, “It may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little artifice, their ancestor owed the constant felicity of his life down to its 79th year in which it was written.” So he is saying I'm telling you like the ideas that allowed me to have a very, very happy and blessed life all the way up until my 79th year, which is how old I am, when I'm writing this. “What reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand of the providence,” meaning what happens in the rest of my life, I don't know, it’s up to God. “But if they arrive, the reflection on past happiness enjoyed ought to help his bearing them with more resignation.” And so now he's going to list the stuff that like what his ingredients for a happy life are. To temperance, he ascribes his long continued health. To industry and frugality, the early easiness of his circumstances and acquisition of his fortune with all that knowledge that enabled him to be a useful citizen and attain for him some degree of reputation among the learners, so going after knowledge, being an interesting person to talk to, that opened up so many different opportunities for him. And he's literally talking to his descendants right now. And that cheerfulness in conversation, which makes his company still sought for and agreeable even to his younger acquaintances. “I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit.” And again, that's closing out on exactly what we're trying to do here is, hey, I want to learn the ideas you had to have a good life. And like that last sentence says, if we're able to like some of my descendants may follow the example and then reap the benefit of his experience. So if you want to get -- read the full story, I'd recommend anybody reading this. I just think 112 pages of straight from the mind of Ben Franklin is actually probably a smart thing to read. I know the language sounds a little funny to us now, but it's really like it takes a little longer to read, certainly, but you can put together quite easily like what he means.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So if you want to do that and support the podcast if you go to founderspodcast.com and you click, there's like in the header, one of the things you can do is like click this like, it looks like the Amazon logo. I have like an Amazon page. You can also go directly to the URL, it's amazon.com/shop/founderspodcast. So amazon.com/shop/founderspodcast. Or just go to founderspodcast.com and click the link. You'll see not only this book, but you'll see all -- I think 60 different books that I have done for the podcast so far, whatever the number is. And they're actually in reverse chronological order. So you can kind of -- it's like a visual of all the books that I have done for the podcast. But anyways, if you use that link and you buy something from there, Amazon sends me a small percentage of sales. So it's a great way to support the podcast. The best way, however, to support the podcast, something I mentioned earlier, I should have mentioned at the beginning, I forgot, was that I now have a daily podcast. And this is something I stumbled upon by accident because for a long time, I've been taking notes, just like I take notes on books of entrepreneurs, I take notes of podcast. And a lot of -- like I've taken a lot of them like, I don't know, 175, maybe I think I’ve taken notes of like 175 different founders, something like that. But anyways, so Founders notes before that was just one weekly e-mail with all the notes, it's like the key ideas. So I take like -- just like I take a book that may take a few hours to read and break it down into like the best ideas that I can cover in an hour or two long podcast. I take a podcast that maybe an hour, 90 minutes long, and I break it down in something you can read in about five to six minutes, right? So I was doing that for a while. And the company I used to do subscriptions, to collect the payments and then deliver the e-mails and also, they archive, which I think is extremely valuable, they added this thing where they wanted like an audio feature.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And at first, I was like, why wouldn't you do that? And then I started testing it, and now I am like, "Oh my God." Like that means I can do -- like just like I'm reading my notes and doing this podcast, right? So I'm reading my notes on this Ben Franklin book. That's what you just heard, the last hour or however long it was. Now every day -- so the new thing I'm doing is every weekday, at 6:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, you'll receive an e-mail from me, okay? That e-mail will have notes on one specific founder, their best ideas, how they think about their business, how they started their business, how they look at the market, tools they use to run their business, different ideas they have, books they read that were helpful, anything that's useful to -- that we want to know, right, and we want to know and share to a lot of people. But now what I'm doing is everyday recording these small little versions of Founders that are me literally going through my notes and adding all the things that come to my mind just like I do on this podcast. So I didn't change anything. It's still -- the price is still the same. It's $10 a month or $100 a year. If you want to support this podcast, please subscribe to Founders Notes because I did -- just like you saw, I do this entire podcast for free. I don't do any ads. I don't do any -- I don't put anything to earn paywalls. So I need your support to be able to dedicate all the time on doing this. And like these podcasts take a long time. I don't think everybody talks about how much prep they do for podcast. I don't think many people read an entire book before they even sit down to record, that's a hell of a lot of preps. So -- and I'm doing that because, one, I enjoy it, and two, I think you learn a lot from it. So if you get value out of my work, if you're learning from what I'm doing in all my time, please go right now, click to -- go to founderspodcast.com, and you can click any single -- it's on the link for Founders Notes on every single podcast I have ever done, and it's included in the header.

So please do that, you'll get a new podcast from me, Monday through Friday, and you have access to all my notes plus all the archives, plus everything else.

So I don't know, all the feedback I got this week, I've done -- I did six this week just to see -- and not only that, like you can listen to the podcast and people respond directly to that e-mail, it goes right to me. And a lot of people have done that. And the feedback has been like, this is a good idea, like there -- so you can read it, you can read or listen to it. But if you -- the chances are, if you like my podcast, and you like what I'm doing here, it's exactly what I'm doing here, but for just a shorter version and every day. And I think it's -- again, by you signing up, that allows me the freedom to make these podcasts and make them freely available to everybody around the world. So please do support there. I think it's -- I think you’ll like it. And if you can, please do it annual basis. The annual basis helps more. It's actually cheaper. It's like $8 a month -- $8.30 a month, something like that. If you can't do the annual basis, do the monthly basis, either one that you want to do. Okay. So that will unlock daily podcast from me and the entire archive. Let's see. What else? Can you do me a favor, too? If you're on Twitter, can you follow the show? It’s @founderpodcast. You also follow me @DavidSenra1, my Twitter is linked on every page of the podcast website, if you want to get it there. But at Founders Podcast, what I'm doing now is I'm just going to be posting like what book I'm working on, so you see like a picture of the book. And then like as I go through the book, interesting ideas or quotes that I find from the book, just stuff like that, like kind of like a behind-the-scenes of this podcast. And if you like some of the stuff I'm posting, if you can re-tweet it into your network, that's a good way to support the podcast too because it kind of spreads, like it makes people aware that this podcast exists, which is extremely helpful. And finally, I have a private podcast feed for those people that are nice enough that leave reviews. So every single podcast you listen to, I bet, or are close to it, the host will ask you to leave a review. I took that one step further. I'm saying, hey, if you leave a review, you take a screenshot of your review and you send it to me at foundersreviews@gmail.com.

So founders, just like the podcast, foundersreviews@gmail.com. Yes, e-mail me the screenshot of your review. I reply back personally with an e-mail that gives you a link directly to my private podcast feed. And if you're on a podcast player like Overcast or Breaker and you don't have the ability to leave a review, they have like a star or a heart button that you can press, it changes color after you press it, take a screenshot, send it to me and you'll get access to my private podcast feed. And these are just versions of Founders that I just say for reviewers, people that review. I've done five of them so far. So if you take a minute or two to do this right now, you'll get – you’ll immediately unlock five podcasts that I've done, and then I'm going to do about one a month moving forward. So -- and that will automatically update in your podcast player just like anything else. And so for a minute or two of your time, you'll get literally, by the time we're done, hundreds of hours of work from me. And again, it's just a way for me to incentivize you because leaving reviews and recommending them in these apps like Overcast and Breaker, Apple Podcasts, et cetera, et cetera, is really, really, really helpful. And it's a way for me as an independent podcaster to kind of level the playing field a little bit against people that have a lot more resources. So anyways, I hope you enjoyed this podcast. I will be back next week. And thank you very much for listening. Thank you very much for telling your friends. I will talk to you next week.

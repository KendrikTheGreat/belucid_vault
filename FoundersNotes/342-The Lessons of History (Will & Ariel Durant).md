Since man is a moment in time, a transient guest of the earth, a spore of his species, a Saiyan of his race, a composite of body, character and mind, a member of a family and a community, a believer or a doubter of a faith, a unit in an economy, perhaps a citizen in a state or a soldier in an army. We may ask under the corresponding heads, astronomy, geology, geography, biology, biography, ethnology psychology, morality, religion, economics, politics, and war, what history has to say about the nature, conduct and prospects of man. It is a precarious enterprise and only a fool would try to compress 100 centuries into 100 pages of hazardous conclusions, yet we proceed.

That was an excerpt in one of my favorite paragraphs in the first chapter of the book that we're going to talk about today, which is The Lessons of History by Will and Ariel Durant. You and I normally get together and speak about a biography of a person. The way to think about the book that I'm holding in my hand is this is a 100-page biography on the human species. And I can't think of more qualified authors to write something like this than Will and Ariel Durant because they spent 40 years from 1935 to 1975, writing this 11-volume set called The Story of Civilization. If you read a bunch of biographies of entrepreneurs, Will and Ariel Durant's The Story of Civilization will pop up over and over again in their biographies because these entrepreneurs are reading it. People like Larry Ellison and Elon Musk come to mind. And part of what makes this book, so special They wrote The Lessons of History after they finished The Story of Civilization. So you could think of this as like a 100-page synopsis or summary of their 40-year, that 4 decade-long journey and trying to catalog the human existence. And so let's jump right in. The first lesson of history is to be modest. Let us define history as the events or records of the past. Human history is a brief spot in space and its first lesson is modesty.

At any moment, a comet may come too close to the earth and set our little Globe turning topsy-turvy in a hectic course or choke it's men and flees with fumes or heat or a fragment of the smiling sun may slip off tangentially and fall upon us in a wild embrace, ending all grief and pain. And then this line hits you right in the chest. They have a bunch of lines like this throughout the book. Generations of men establish a growing mastery over the earth, but they are destined to become fossils in its soil. And so I've read and reread this book three, four times, not including the times I listen to it on Audible as well. And so I have a bunch of notes from the last time I read it, but what came to mind this time, when I read the sentence, I thought about what Charlie Munger said, that what you and I are doing here is we're reading biographies of great people. We're becoming friends with the imminent dead. And because most of the people that I read about are dead, when I get to the end of the book, I'm not just getting to the end of the book, I'm getting to the end of somebody's life. So I am constantly, and you are as a byproduct of listening, you are constantly reminded of the finiteness of life that generations of men established are growing mastery over the earth, but they're destined to become fossils in its soil. So what I think about this is its ruthless -- it forces ruthless prioritization upon how I'm spending my time and what I choose to focus on. And it comes down to 3 Fs for me, founders, family, and friends. And that's all I'm focused on. Everything else has to round to zero, that is one of the main benefits of this relentless pursuit of studying history. You understand that you're destined to become fossils in its soil. The last time I read the book when I got to this part. This is what I wrote and reminds me of why Nolan Bushnell said, he was Steve Jobs mentor. He said Steve Jobs only had one speed go. And he said that about a 19-year-old Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs did not know how limited to his time on earth would be, right? And so you don't get much time, don't waste it, go. Ruthless prioritization of how we spend our time is I think is super important.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Now there's going to be a bunch of just they're obviously incredible writers. And they have the ability to distill an entire story into one sentence, and on a few pages later, I love this. The influence of geographic factors diminishes as technology grows. So they are speaking about the entire sweep of human history as time goes forward, right? The influence of geographic factors diminishes as technology grows. The book that I'm holding in my hand was written in 1968, and yet that line is even more true today. The influencer geographic factors diminishes as technology grows. Go back to when you and I said Napoleon. He spends an unbelievable amount of time talking about physical barriers. Physical barriers of moving an army somewhere from one place to another. This is what you do when you come into a river. This is what happens how you handle mountains. Napoleon died in 1821. The airplane was not invented yet. So the influence of geographic factors diminishes as technology grows. So I was thinking about the life of Will Durant specifically because he started, he wrote like the first half of The Story of Civilization alone and then his wife joins for the second half. And so I looked up when he was alive. And I was, okay, he was born in 1885 and he dies in 1981. And a huge theme of this book is the influence of technology and the tools that we invent on the human species. And so I went to ChatGPT, and I asked this like, okay, can you give me a list of significant technological advancements that were created between the periods of 1885 and 1981. Listen to what was invented in the life of Will Durant. So you have the invention of the first automobile, the invention of the first camera that makes photography accessible to the masses. The invention of radio, of the powered airplane, of penicillin, of the atomic bomb, of the transistor, of the solar cell, the integrated circuit, the ARPANET, which, of course, is the precursor to the Internet, the microprocessor, the mobile phone, the personal computer and finally, the Walkman, which was invented in 1979 and then Will dies 2 years later.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

That is an incredible amount of technological progress in one lifetime. And that continues to accelerate today. Like even the technology I used to produce that list and to help me with the research of this episode. If you're not already using these AI systems like ChatGPT, it is remarkable. I use it multiple, multiple times a day. In fact, I built my own, which indexes all my notes, all my highlights, all my transcripts, every single word I have ever uttered on the entire podcast in the last 8 years. I've been testing for a few weeks, it should be available to all Founder Notes subscribers, I would say, in the next week or two. But let me give you an example. I was just on the phone. I'm going to be speaking at an event with -- I can't tell you who the company is, but it's one of the largest asset managers in the world. They have over $2 trillion of assets under management. And while we are on the phone, they wanted me to talk about leadership lessons from History's Greatest Entrepreneurs. So I just asked Founders Notes. Again, this feature that I used, while I was on the phone is not available to you yet, but it should be in a few weeks. And within 20 seconds, it gives me a list and a summary of ideas on leadership from Ted Turner, Charlie Munger, Barnett Helzberg, Barnett Helzberg is the guy that sold his family business to Warren Buffett. And the list continues. James Dyson, David Ogilvy, the founder of Trader Joe's, Alibaba. I haven't done a podcast on Jack Ma in like 7 years, Warren Buffett, Jim Collins, I've never done a podcast on Jim Collins, but I mentioned something he said about leadership in an episode that I did like 5 years ago. Jeff Bezos, Henry Ford, and Steve Jobs. And so all that comes to mind from one simple sentence because the influencer geographic factors diminishes as technology grows. What the impact -- what's fascinating thing about that is the influence of what else besides geographic factors, right? What other factors are going to diminish as technology grows. And so moving on. The next chapter is about biology and its effect on history. This is really a lot about on competition, selection. There's just a lot of ideas that pop to mind. Really the main theme of what I'm about to read to you is our job is to make our companies and ourselves better equipped to meet the test of survival. Competition is the trade of life

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so they're going to draw some lessons from history about that for you and I. The laws of biology are the fundamental lessons of history. We are subject to the processes and trials of evolution to the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest to survive. So the first biological lesson of history is that life is competition. Competition is not only the life of trade. It is the trade of life. They're just fantastic. This is what makes such a great communicator. It's not only that they're able to explain something, take something complex and make it simple. But they put ideas -- whatever they want you to understand from their brain to yours, it goes right, and competition is not -- only the life of trade is the trade of life. It is peaceful in food abounds and violent when the mouths outrun the food. Animals eat one another without qualm, civilized men consume one another by due process of law. Cooperation is real and increases with social development, but mostly because it is a tool and form of competition. We cooperate in our group, our family, community, company, right, he didn't write company but I’m putting in there, our family, community, company, club, Church, party, race, nation in order to strengthen our group in its competition with other groups. So it's impossible for an entrepreneur to read that sentence, right? He's not talking about entrepreneurship and not think of company building. That is the group that we operate in the most. That is the group that you and I think about the most. We are acquisitive, greedy, and pugnacious. He's talking about the human species, right? Remember, let's go back to the very beginning. I don't even think I elaborated on why I love that paragraph from the first chapter from the introduction. It is a precarious enterprise and only a fool will try to compress 100 centuries into 100 pages is exactly what they're doing. They're trying to compress in hundred centuries of observation, what are we? And what can history tell us about our nature, right? We are acquisitive, greedy and pugnacious because our blood remembers millennium through which our forebears had to chase and fight and kill in order to survive and had to eat to their gastric capacity for fear, they soon should not capture another feast.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

War, which he's going to talk about a lot, war is a nation's way of eating. What a sentence hopefully, by the end of this, if you don't already have the book, I'm going to convince you to buy a copy of the book. And if you have Audible, I'm pretty sure I have a subscription to Audible. I don't remember buying the audiobook, but I have access. There's a version of The Lessons of History where you actually hear commentary from Will and Ariel Durant. And I'm pretty sure it's included in every single Audible subscription. War is a nation's way of eating. It promotes cooperation because it is the ultimate form of competition. The second biological lesson of history is that life is selection. So the first biological lesson of history is that life is competition. The second lesson of history is that life is selection. In the competition for food, or mates, or power, or customers -- again, I'm going to throw in some company things here, okay, or power. Some organizations succeed and some fail. In the struggle for existence, some companies succeed, some fail. In the struggle for existence, some individuals are better equipped than others to meet the test of survival. That is when I start double underlining, that is when they start adding all these exclamation points. In the struggle for existence, some companies are better equipped than others to meet the test of survival. Our job is to make sure that our companies and ourselves are better equipped to meet the test of survival. A few pages later, it's all about differentiation produces unequal value. Come on, this is like screaming to you and I on how to build a valuable company. So let’s go right to the book. And equality is not only natural and inborn, it grows with the complexity of civilization again. Was written in 1968, undoubtedly, our civilization is a lot more complex today than it was then. Inequality is not only natural and inborn, it grows with the complexity of civilization. Economic development specializes functions. It differentiates abilities and makes men unequally valuable to their group. The note I left myself -- I read this book a couple of years ago, I should read it every year. I should remember to read it every year because you can read it in the weekend. Differentiation produces unequal value, learn and optimize for this. So the heavy -- there's a founder named Naval Ravikant. He's the founder of AngelList. I covered the book that my friend, Eric Jorgenson wrote with Naval all the way back in Episode 191 if you haven't listened to it, I highly recommend you listen to the episode after this one and then read the book, of course. The book is available for free online. But my friend, Eric told me they -- even though you can read the book for free online.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

They sold over 1 million copies of that book, and it's only been out for a few years. But Naval has a great way to describe exactly what Will and Ariel Durant are saying here. Economic development specializes functions, differentiates ability, and makes men unequally valuable to their group. Remember, the more complex a civilization gets the more you'll see inequality, so economic inequality, right? So the way Naval's had influence on my thinking about this, is he says something like we're living in the age of infinite leverage, right? And in the age of imminent leverage, it is more important to be at the extreme of your craft, to the extreme of your work. Why? Because the person that is the -- he says the person that is the best in the world at what they do gets to do it for everyone. In the age of infinite leverage, we should see this idea that economic development specializes functions, differentiates ability, and makes men unequally valuable to their group. We should see that only continue to expand and become more important. That's why years ago, I wrote to my own self, learn, and optimize for this. That also ties to what I told you earlier about this reminder for history -- from history that our time is finite. That is why its founders, family and friends. The opportunity cost is too high to waste, not only is my time is limited, but I'm heavily incentivized to become the best in the world at what I do because economic development specialized functions, differentiability and makes men unequally valuable to their group, back to this. For freedom and equality are sworn and everlasting enemies. And when one prevails, the other dies. If you leave men free and their natural inequalities will multiply almost geometrically leave men free and their natural inequalities will multiply almost geometrically. Only the man who is below average in economic ability desires equality, those who are conscious of superior ability, desire freedom. And in the end, superior ability has its way, and in the end, superior ability has its way. Talent is the best asset class. Utopias of equality are biologically doomed. That sentence particularly hits me right in the heart. Utopias of equality are biologically doomed. I'm the son of acumen immigrant. I grew up, meeting people that pit their children on rafts and sent them 90 miles across shark-infested waters to flee communism. Since I was a child, I met people that did this. And then I remember getting older and actually running into people that think communism is a good idea.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I'm sweating thinking about this. And I used to even getting these debates. Now I'm just like whatever you can believe whatever you want. But I think the key here is it's very simple, okay? How many people have put their children on rafts and hope that they make it across 90 miles of shark-infested waters to flee free market capitalism. Do you see a line that go down to Key West or Miami Beach and put their American kids on rafts and hope that they make it to Cuba. And the crazy thing is if you just study history, you understand that, of course, it's not going to work. Utopians of equality are biologically doomed. And so look at the difference in growth between Cuba and America and his next sentence, a society in which all potential abilities are allowed to develop, and function will have a survival advantage. History doesn't repeat, Human Nature does So let's move on to character in history. I'm telling you my palms are sweating right now. All right. Let's move on to character and history. Human nature does not change. This part is just so, so good. We talked about all over and over again, history doesn't repeat, human nature does. History shows little alteration in the conduct of mankind. The Greeks of Plato’s time behave very much like the French of modern centuries. And the Romans behave like English, means and instrumentalities change, motives and ends remain the same, to act or rest, to acquire or give, to fight or retreat, to seek association or privacy, to mate or to reject, to offer or resent parental care. Nor does human nature alter as between classes. This is another double underline sentence here, nor does human nature alter between classes. By and large, the poor have the same impulses as the rich with only less opportunity or skill to implement them. Nothing is clear in history than the adoption by successful rebels of the methods they were accustomed to condemn in the forces they deposed. That's obvious in history, that's also obvious and fiction. If you've ever read the book Animal Farm, they just gave you one sentence summary in there. The adoption by successful rebels of the methods we are customed to condemn and the forces they deposed. New situations, however, do arise, requiring novel unstereotyped responses, hence, development, and this development requires a capacity for experimentation and innovation. Here, the initiative individual, so this applies to you and I, because this is what we study, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

We -- he's going to call the initiative individual, the great man, the hero, the genius regains his place as a formative force in history. He grows out of his time. He's talking about the fact that the reappearance of these kind of personalities are entirely predictable and usually what environment is required for them to appear. He grows out of his time and land and is the product and symbol of events as well as their agent and voice. Without some situation requiring a new response, his new ideas would be untimely and impractical. I would pause right there, I would really think of Churchill in this case, right? If there wasn't -- his whole life, I've done multiple part series on Churchill, I covered him when he was a young kid, I covered him when he was an old man and everything in between and the whole thing was, he believed in his destiny. He was just waiting for the right time. And yet if it wasn't for the invasion of Britain by Hitler and Nazi, we are likely not speaking about Churchill today, even though he'd be the same person. When he is a hero of action, right, you need some situation requiring a new response. So Churchill needed that response. The invasion and really World War II in its entirety. So you need some situation requiring a new response. His new ideas would be untimely and impractical. When he is a hero of action, the demands of his position and the exhaustion of crisis develop and inflate him to such magnitude and powers as would in normal times have remained potential untapped. And just listen to this writing, events take place through him as well as around him, his ideas and decisions enter vitally into the course of history. Oh, that's Solaris. I was thinking about Churchill, and I forgot that they were going to mention him here. At times, his eloquence, like Churchills maybe worth 1,000 regimens. His foresight and strategy and tactics like Napoleons, may win battles and campaigns and establish states. And then this is just what a sentence -- what a sentence. The imitating majority follows the innovating minority, and this follows the original individual in adapting new responses to the demands of environmental survival. And then they go into detail on why time-tested ideas are usually more valuable than new ideas, but that is not always the case. Out of every 100 new ideas, 99 or more will probably be inferior to the traditional responses, which they propose to replace.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

No one man, however, brilliant, or well informed can come in on lifetime to such fullness of understanding as to safely judge and dismiss the customs or institutions of his society. For these are the wisdom of generations after centuries of experiment in the laboratory of history. And then there's just a few lines in the chapter on morals and history and the weird thoughts that come to mind when I read stuff like this, I guess, let me just jump right to the point what I wrote myself. If you can identify an enduring human need, you can build a business around that. And I'm not casting judgment on what any businesses that other people build, but you see that there's businesses around us that will endure no matter what, some legal, some not, right? And so it says sin has flourished in every age. Men and women have gambled in every age. And I think that line is particularly interesting right now because you just see the change in regulations and laws and these really gigantic businesses built around gambling. And I have friends that ask me like, why don't you bet on sports and I just quote Ed Thorp. I was like, I don't invest anywhere where I don't have an edge. The only place I have an edge is in my actual business. And it's actually surprised me recently like how prevalent and just giant like big these businesses get, it shouldn't have surprised me though because I had read this book, I had previously underlined this line. Men and women have gambled in every age. I just forgot it. And then this next sentence, I think everybody will agree with is my favorite sentence in this entire section. In every age, men have been dishonest, and governments have been corrupt in every age of human history. What does that tell you? Governments have been corrupt. Men have been dishonest and governments have been corrupt. But I think the top-level lesson or the meta lesson around that is identifying an enduring human need and building a business around that. And then one enduring and repeating need has an entire -- of the human species has entire chapter based on it, its religion and history. Religion It says, even the skeptical historian develops a humble respect for religion, since he sees it functioning and seemingly indispensable in every land and in every age to the unhappy, the suffering, the bereaved, the old, it has brought supernatural comforts valued by millions of souls as more precious than any natural aid. And I just spent 3 days this past week with 150 very inspiring and ambitious and successful entrepreneurs that listen to this podcast, and this is something that actually came up. I wish we didn't record anything on purpose. I want these events to be very special and it's like you have to be there. And a lot of -- when you're not recording people tend to speak more honestly and more freely. And something that came up where I was like, man, I wish I had recorded myself saying this was I actually think there's a lot that companies can learn by studying religions because religions, if you think about what Will and Ariel Durant saying here, like they've lasted longer than companies do, they last longer than countries do.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And the reason this came to mind is because somebody onetime described Founders Podcast as Church for entrepreneurs. And I think there's a lot of lessons here for you as you're leading your company because my friend Patrick from Invest Like the Best. I always say, like repetition is persuasive. He put it may be even better. He says that repetition does not spoil the prayer. And I think one of the main lessons that entrepreneurs and company builders can learn from religions is if you think about all the major religious in the world, right, usually based on some kind of book, I grew up Christian, so I'll just use that as an example. We don't read the Bible once and they're like, "Oh, I got it. We're good". No, we revisit it, we go back to it, then we gather, right? We repeat lessons from it over and over and over again. Repetition is pervasive. Repetition does not spoil the prayer. We gather at specific intervals, every Wednesday or every Sunday or whatever time in your religion, religions have different days of the week or time periods, but you'll see them consistently. They gather together. Sometimes it's every day. And they gather together with people that believe in the same things that they do, and they repeat the lessons that they agree upon and then they want to guide their actions and guide like their path in life is very similar, like if you go back and read any of the shareholders like the example I used a couple of days ago, was Jeff Bezos. There's ideas and phrases and mindsets that are in his very first shareholder in '97 that are in his last one 20 years later. And you see this over and over again, these biographies of entrepreneurs. They repeat the same lessons decade after decade after decade. The same way that the religions do, and then they go back to the importance that history optimizes for survival. History remains at bottom, a natural selection of the fittest individuals to fittest companies and groups in a struggle where in goodness receives no favors, misfortunes abound, and the final test is the ability to survive. Nature and history do not agree with our conceptions of good and bad. They define good as that which survives and bad as that which goes under. Now it's insane really like remarkable, I guess, is a better word than insane. How much of this book is about the importance of survival, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Nature and history do not agree with our conceptions of good and bad. They define good is that what survives and bad as which goes under how many times do you and I talk about and repeat the quotes and the ideas of history's greatest founders on the importance of survival. One of my favorite lines on this actually came from Steve Jobs. He says victory in our industry is spelled survival. Victory in our industry is spelled survival. A few years ago, I read a 700-page biography on Charles de Gaulle. And everybody around him, Churchill, FTR, they just could not understand why the guy just refused to quit. And you could almost summarize his entire philosophy around fighting Hitler and making sure that France remains free to his fantastic quote. He says, all that matters is to survive. The rest is just words. In a more business context, think about if you read Warren Buffett shareholders, I think this is Episode 227 Warren Buffett's Essays, which is Warren shareholder letters, but organized instead of by years organized by topic, which is excellent. And he talks about that they play offense where others scramble for survival. Let me read from his shareholder letters. I think this was -- this is after 2008. I don't have the exact year, but I'm going to read this to you. And really, the -- again, the reason I'm bringing this up is because a strong financial foundation is what allows you to survive, right, to not ever take risks of -- I'm going to risk the remote chance that my business goes out of -- that my company goes down or my business dies to make a little bit of extra money. Warren and Charlie would smack in the face if you did that. So Warren says, by being so cautious in respect to leverage, we penalize our returns by a minor amount, having loads of liquidity, loads of cash, right, having loads of cash lets us sleep well. Moreover, during the episodes of financial chaos that occasionally erupt in our economy, we will be equipped both financially and emotionally to play offense while others scramble for survival, what a line. We play offense while other scramble for survival. That's what allowed us to invest $15.6 billion in 25 days of panic following the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008 to invested $15.6 billion in 25 days of panic. And so what does this all have to do with religion. This is really a one-sentence summary, which, again, Will and Ariel Durant are gifted at one lesson of history is that religion has many lives and a habit of resurrection. In other words, religion survives throughout history. Economics

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

All right. Now we got into economics and the lessons are even more obvious for you and I. History reports that men who can manage men manage the men who can manage only things. And the men who can manage money manage all. So think about that the way -- this is the note of myself that I think is a good summary of that. The strong rule the weak, the wise rule the strong and incentives rule all and then he goes into the fact that history is inflationary. So the bankers watching the trends in agricultural, history, trade, inviting and directing the flow of capital, putting our money doubly to work, controlling loans and interest in enterprise running great risks to make great, great -- great gains rise to the top of the economic period. And this is -- if you read the sentence now you're like, yes, it's obviously like, look, I read this is many, many years ago was like financial services was something like 8% of GDP by size, about like 40% by profit. I forgot what the exact stat was, but that's how I remember and we think, oh, this is like unique to our time and then he goes back and he's like, well, this isn't unique to your time. He's describing the Medicis. The Fugger’s -- I've done a bunch of podcasts on it. I did podcast on Jakob Fugger. If you just search in your podcast by it’s the richest -- I think he's like the richest man in history. The Rothschild, did two episodes -- two or three episodes on them, the Morgans. And so over and over again, these are the people that arise at the top of the economic pyramid, are not the only ones, obviously, the company builders, too. Perhaps it is one secret of their power that having studied the fluctuations of prices. They know that history is inflationary, and that money is the last thing a wise man would hoard. The experience of the past leaves little doubt that every economic system was sooner or later rely upon some form of the profit motive to stir individuals and groups to productivity. And then they reintroduced something they introduced earlier, the fact that humans are inherently inequal, the more complex, the more technologically advanced a society gets, the more you're going to see this -- the differences in the -- in this human ability expand. Since practical ability differs from person to person, the majority of such abilities is gathered in the minority of men. The concentration of wealth is a natural result of this concentration of ability and regularly recurs in history. The rate of concentration varies with the economic freedom permitted, despotism may for a time, retard the concentration, democracy allowing the most liberty accelerates it. And so even though this reappears over and over again, it does need alleviation -- really concentration of wealth does not seem to be tenable. We conclude that the concentration of wealth is natural and inevitable and is periodically alleviated by violent or peaceable partial redistribution.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

In this view, all economic history is the slow heartbeat of the social organism. I like that they use the heartbeat metaphor there. And so what's interesting is right after the chapter economics, they talk about government. And if we just went through, hey, usually the most prosperous is when you have freedom, people are connecting their own interests, their incentives are more aligned than if you have the centrally controlled system. But yet if you study human history, essentially every single government is going to default into an oligarchy. I didn't say that word correctly. oligarchy is what I meant to say. So this is fascinating. If we're to judge forms of government from their prevalence and duration in history, we should have to give the palm to monarchy. Democracies by contrast, have been hectic interlude. So what are they saying monarchy is the longest lasting and most common form of government and history, democracies, by contrast, have been hectic interlude. Now this is -- there is a statement or a reoccurring theme in history called the iron law of oligarchy, and they go into detail about that here, and it has to do with this inherent difference in the abilities of human beings. Most governments have been oligarchies ruled by a minority, chosen either by birth or by a religious organization or by wealth. It is unnatural for a majority to rule for a majority can seldom be organized and united and into specific action and a minority can. If the majority of abilities is contained in a minority of men, minority government is as inevitable as the concentration of wealth, see how they tie everything that we -- like the past three themes together. If the majority of the buildings is contained in the minority of men, minority government is as inevitable as a concentration of wealth. The majority can do no more than periodically throw out one minority and set up another. And so the summary there is the Iron law of oligarchy. And so a few pages later, it goes back to this idea that you and I keep talking about. This is why you should spend so much of your time learning and practicing so you can be better at your craft. Every advance in the complexity of the economy puts an added premium upon superior ability. Every advance in the complexity of the economy puts an added premium upon superior ability.

And so a lot earlier in the book, we went over the fact that in the biology and history chapter that war is a nation's way of eating. It promotes cooperation because it's the ultimate form of competition. And that the first biological lesson of history is that life is competition. And so this next sentence, although provocative will not be surprising. War is one of the constants of history and has not diminished with civilization or democracy. In the last 3,421 years of recorded history, only 268 have seen no war. War or competition is the father of all things, the potent source of ideas, inventions, institutions and states and that idea that war, I've done a couple of podcasts on this that war is a potent source of ideas. When it is literally life and death, you will see human ingenuity at the -- maybe at the Apex. I mean if you think about The General and the Genius that book, I did many, many years ago on the partnership between J. Robert Oppenheimer and Gen. Leslie Groves. But there's actually an excellent book that speaks about this heroic effort for the United States Industrial complex to turn on a dime in World War II and go for manufacturing things for consumers to manufacturing things to help the allies in the war. It's called Freedom's Forge, I read it. I did a podcast on it a long time ago. I think I deleted the podcast. I can't find it, but I'm going to reread that book because I think it's fascinating. It's really -- it's on ingenuity, but really leadership and how large groups of people can get things done incredibly fast, I think, is the main lesson. The same causes of war are the same as the causes of competition among individuals, acquisitiveness, pugnacity and pride, the desire for food, land, materials, fuels, and mastery. War is the final arbiter. A nation must be ready, just like a company must be ready at any moment to defend itself. And when its central interests are involved, it must be allowed to use any means it considers necessary to its survival. So this goes on for many pages. And really, you can, again, another one-sentence summary, whether the lesson that we derive through studying 100 centuries of human history. The 10 commandments must be silent when self-preservation is at stake. Man is a competitive animal, and his states must be like himself. And then if you have the book, I think you're especially going to be interested in the growth and decay chapter. They're talking about civilizations. I think with you and I, obviously, the lesson for companies, jumps off the page. This is really why there's always more opportunity. There's always room for a new company, a new startup because on all -- on one point, we are all agreed, civilizations begin, flourish, decline and disappear.

Companies begin, flourish, decline and disappear. So what determines if this challenge will be met. If we put the problem further back and ask what determines whether a challenge will or will not be met, the answer is that this depends upon the presence of creative individuals or you and I call founders, right, of creative individuals with clarity of mind and energy of will capable of effective responses to new situations that -- and they're talking about civilizations, so they're talking about all kinds of things. Survival and Death It holds precisely true with founders of companies too. Will this new challenge be met? Well, the answer is that this depends upon the presence of a creative individual with clarity of mind and energy of will, capable of effective responses to new situations. And so we see not only the death of individuals, but the death of entire civilizations. And they're like, well, this is depressing. And really, this is on the idea is being immortal whether in individuals or in states, death is natural. And if it comes in due time, it is forgivable and useful, and the mature mind will take no offense from its coming. But do civilizations die, again, not quite. Greek civilization is not really dead. Only its frame is gone, and its habitat has changed. It survives in the memory and in such abundance that no one life, however, full and long could absorb it all, and this is a great -- again, you do a great job of summarizing in one sentence what they mean. Homer has more readers now than in his own day and land. The Greek poets and philosophers are in every library in college. At this moment, Plato is being studied by 100,000 discovers of the dear delight of philosophy over spreading life with understanding thought, meaning that 100,000 people discovering Plato for the very first time right now, this selective survival of creative minds is the most real and beneficiary of immortality. Going back to this, if you can find an enduring need, you can build a business around that. All technological advances will have to be written off as merely new means of achieving old ends. We are driven by the same desires, the same proclivities. We just find different ways to satisfy them. Now we get into the mind of humans. You and I do this, I'm sure you do, too. Our capacity for fretting is endless.

And no matter how many difficulties we surmount? How many ideas we realize? We shall always find an excuse being magnificently miserable. The study of history allows you to stand outside yourself and realize, hey, these feelings, what I'm going through, what I desire, the things I love, the things I have enjoyed, there are things that bring sadness. They are not unique to me. And I think it's so important to get control of our minds because we have this one shot. I love what Dee Hock said, the founder of Visa. When he said, life is a magnificent mysterious odyssey to be experienced. We do not want our minds to make this one magnificent odyssey miserable. We must control our capacity for fretting since we know in nature and human nature is endless. And then as expected, they find the perfect way to end a book on lessons of history. Some precious achievements have survived all the vastitudes of rising and falling states, the making of fire in light of the wheel and other basic tools, language, writing, art and song, agriculture, the family, social organization, morality and charity and the use of teaching to transmit the lore of the family and the human race. It's exactly what's happening now. We're reading words of somebody that's no longer with us, who's been dead for almost 50 years. These are the elements of civilization, and they have been tenaciously maintained through the perilous passage from one civilization to the next. They are the connective tissue of human history. If education is a transmission of civilization, we are unquestionably progressing. Civilization is not inherited. It has to be learned and earned by each generation and new. If the transmission should be interrupted for one century, civilization would die, and we should be savages again. If progress is real. It is not because we are born any better or wiser than infants were in the past, but because we are born to a richer heritage, born on a higher level of that pedestal, which the accumulation of knowledge raises as the ground and support of our being. The heritage rises and man rises in proportion as he receives it. To those of us who study history, not merely as a warning and a reminder of man's follies and crimes, but also as an encouraging remembrance of generative souls, the past ceases to be a depressing chamber of horrors. It becomes a celestial city, a spacious country of the mind where in thousand saints, statesmen, inventors, scientists, poets, artists, musicians, lovers, and philosophers will still live and speak, teach and carve and sing.

The historian will not mourn because he can see no meaning in human existence, except that which man puts into it. Let it be our pride that we ourselves may put meaning into our lives and sometimes a significance that transcends death if a man is fortunate, he will, before he dies, gather up as much as he can of his civilized heritage and transmit it to his children. And to his final breadth, he will be grateful for this inexhaustible legacy knowing that it is our nourishing mother and our lasting life. That is incredible, Will and Ariel Durant, can write, they can teach, and they can inspire. For the full story, highly, highly, highly recommend getting the book.

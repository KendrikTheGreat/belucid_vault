He was very -- this -- I mean, listen, everybody that we talk about, everybody in the world is weird if you get close enough, right? And especially these eccentrics that we study, like I'm not going to write a book about you if you're entirely normal. But he was very bizarre where for, I would say, I don't know, like 40 years of his life, he lived alone. He was wealthy by that time. So he had like servants, like maid, stuff like that. But even when he gets married, he gets married for the second time at 55 years old, I think he is 55, and then he gets married again when he's like 80. So he's married for like 3 or 4 years when he is 55. They get divorced. That's Zsa Zsa Gabor, I guess she is like -- according to the author, like one of the -- she is like the Kim Kardashian of her day, where she was just famous for being famous. She didn't really have like -- she was just well known for being well known. But anyways, like even when she moves in with him, he refuses to share a room with her, and like he won't -- she's forbid to go in his room. Like he was just extremely private weird dude. And then he -- I think he winds up sharing a bedroom later on a life because he gets married, like -- I think he is married for like 3 or 4 years right before he dies. So -- but this whole idea that he was, to a large extent, a private man, that's an understatement. All right. So he says -- so he's in -- now we're going to get inside of like -- he's an extremely driven man. He's got family, but he's also like kind of a lonely guy. So he's in New York City around New Year's Eve, checking out the Hotel Pierre for a potential deal. And this scene I'm bringing you into is just like, he's in a bar, it's New Year's Eve 1941, and he's depressed. And it says, "Because he was alone in a room full of happy strangers, this one somehow felt even more discouraging than the others. While he had previously done a lot with his life, all around him, it was glaringly obvious that others had somehow done what he hadn't."

"As of December 31, 2011, the assets of the Conrad Hilton Foundation were approximately $2 billion, probably more money than Conrad Hilton ever could have imagined making in his lifetime. After all, almost a 100 years ago, he was a man with just $5,000 to his name, all of which he decided to use to purchase the ramshackle Mobley Hotel in Cisco, Texas. If not for the help of his devoted mother and an assortment of friends, he never would have been able to put together the balance of the $40,000 purchase price. From there, his empire grew not only in this country but around the world. His is a true, genuine American success story, or as his son Barron once proudly put it, 'It's definitely one for the record books, and not a day goes by that I don't sit and marvel at what my father did with his life. It is my hope that others are inspired by my father's story'."

So that was just a random paragraph I found towards the end of this gigantic book that I'm going to talk to you about today. So that book is The Hiltons: The True Story of an American Dynasty, and it was written by J. Randy Taraborrelli. And just two quick things before I jump back into the book. One, don't forget to sign up for the Misfit Feed. Every other podcast I do is available exclusively for Misfits. To sign up, all you have to do is tap the link that's in the show notes on your podcast player and within like 15 or 20 seconds, you have access to that feed. And of course, like every other podcast I do, both the free ones and the ones for Misfits, none of them have ads in it. Second, if you want access to yet another private podcast feed, this one, all you have to do is leave a review. If you leave a review, screenshot it and send it to me at foundersreviews@gmail.com, I'll reply back to your e-mail with the private podcast feed. And if you're listening on like Overcast, all you have to do for that is tap the star, which is how you recommend individual episodes in Overcast. It turns gold, take a screenshot of that, send it to me. Okay. So let's jump into this book. There's a lot -- I have a lot of notes. Like I said earlier, it was a gigantic book, like 500 pages long. So I'm going to read to you what I thought was originally going to be the intro of the podcast, and this is from the prologue. And it just kind of outlines a little bit -- well, a lot about Conrad Hilton actually. It says, "It was true that throughout his lifetime, Conrad Hilton had been a man used to being in complete control of himself and, some might argue, everyone around him. As one of the most successful businessmen in the world, he had made hundreds of millions of dollars with hotels around the world bearing his name. He certainly didn't carve out such a niche by allowing others to impose their will upon him."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"It had long been Conrad's belief that merely being related to him should not guarantee his heirs a carefree, privileged life. He had made his money in what he called 'the good old-fashioned way', meaning he had earned it. A product of the Great Depression, he wanted his relatives to inherit his work ethic, not his money." So what they're talking about there is, I would say, like a good 15% towards the end of the book after Conrad dies, is this protracted fight by some of his relatives to overturn his will. And Conrad, he did like 10 or 15 different revisions of his will throughout his lifetime as he aged. And in every single one, he would allocate basically less than 1% of his assets to his family members or even people that worked from him whatever the case was. So at the time he died, he had somewhere around what today would be a net worth around $10 billion, maybe a little less, but an astounding amount of money at the time. And he gave over 99% of that to charity. And most of that money would go to helping like the children, the sick. He was really into donating to hospitals and especially the Catholic Church. As we're going to learn today, he is extremely devout religious man. He was kind of -- I would describe him, especially some of the behavior towards his -- like his children and other family members, he was a bit of a hard-ass. And so -- but I wouldn't look at that in like isolation as we'll learn like he started his business in the depths of the Great Depression. And so as we've seen with some of the founders in the past that went through and lived through the Great Depression, it affected the way they thought about money for the rest of their lives. Okay. So let's jump into, here is his idea about being the curse, that there's a curse of the ambitious and then we're going to go into a little bit about like how his religious beliefs affected like his work. So he says, "Conrad was a new breed of businessman for his times, optimistic when there seemed little reason to be, especially during the war and the depression. He had faith in America and in her ability to rise once again to be a nation greater than ever before and to prosper if just given a bit of time to do so. But more than anything, he wanted to be at the forefront of this national renaissance." A crazy story is that he breaks ground. I don't know if he breaks ground or if it's actually finished, I actually can't remember. But let's say, he finishes a hotel, the largest project he ever made. He borrowed like over $1 million for a hotel. This is right at the end of the 1920s and 11 days later is when the stock market crashes. So he just had really bad timing. So it says, "Conrad would kneel and pray every night on a small rug when he was just a boy about 10."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he has this conversation, this conversation would tell you about this priest happens when he's about 10 years old and the priest tells him. "The priest had told him, that if he had said the Hail Mary and then Saint Joseph pray for us 3 times in rapid succession, God would always take care of him. Therefore, every single day for the last 40-some years, he had made sure to start each prayer session with his God with those specific prayers, in that exact order." "His religion was always a source of comfort for him. Still, he often wondered how it was that a man so accomplished could also be so lonely." I'll tell you more about that later. "I guess you could say it's the curse of the ambitious he said. 'Perhaps I'm a walking cliche. I have everything, yet it sometimes feels as if I have little.' He had been alone for so long that it had gotten to the point where his greatest passion seem to take the form of inanimate objects." So I need to lay this foundation so you understand that his one true love of his life was work, especially the hotel industry, which I'll tell you how he stumbles into that. But this whole -- this is a reoccurring theme, especially as he gets -- because he lives -- I think he lived until he was like 91 years old, something like that. And a lot of the conversations he has in his 80s, as we'll see, is like filled with regret. And it's this idea that he was alone for so long. He was married a total of 3 times, and it wasn't until he was in his 80s that he finally found somebody that he said he was like truly loved. So we're going to hear a little bit about how -- what the author is saying here about his greatest passion seemed to take form of inanimate objects. This is what he means. "He now referred to his hotels as his women. 'She's a great dame, that one,' he would say of his Texas Holdings, the Abilene Hilton. 'No woman can match her,' he would opine of his Dallas Hilton. 'Luckily for me, she could not find a better suitor,' he observed of the Sir Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco. Besides his religion, the only thing that truly mattered to him that gave him the most pleasure was his work."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Conrad would once again do what he had done whenever he felt a lack of something in his personal life. He would go about the business of filling the void." Meaning he would go and try to do another acquisition of a hotel. "He wasn't the kind of man to play it safe. He was shrewd, and he liked to take chances. He wanted to live his life for all it was worth, damn the consequences." Okay. So now I'm going to go back in the timeline. And I want to talk to you about his early life and work. And this is -- these are the parts of these books that I personally find most motivating because I just told you, he died with almost a $10 billion net worth. And Conrad, as we'll see, as with a lot of the people that -- a lot of entrepreneurs that we've covered on the podcast, they don't start in a good spot, and he definitely did not start out in a good spot. So it says, "He was born on a snowy Christmas Day in 1887. He was the second of nine children. Most of the children were born in the adobe dwelling that housed Gus's general store," Gus is father. And this was in San Antonio, a territory of New Mexico. New Mexico was not part of the union at the time. It says, "Because he was the family's first-born son, he was expected to take his place in the general store while he was still young. Thus, it was at his father's elbow that he began his apprenticeship into the world of business, mastering the laws of supply and demand and honing the entrepreneurial skills that would serve him so well for the rest of his life." "An adventurous, high-spirited lad, he also undertook, on his own, such productive ventures as going into the produce business, first, by cultivating a piece of his father's land and then by planting and later selling vegetables door-to-door. Though he could barely peer over the counter at Gus's store, he was there almost every day after school. This is where he would first learn the value of hard work and tough negotiation."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Now that sounds like a good start. A place to start where your father owns his own business. This is where you're learning about how to deal with customers and how to deal with inventory. But that's -- this description gives you a more accurate idea of like his early living conditions. "Pictures of the homestead show a dilapidated structure that looked as if it might collapse at any moment. 'We're talking about cowboy country here,' observed one of Hilton's relatives, 'Cowboy hats, horses, stagecoaches, dirt roads, moonshine and saloons, the works'." And so, as we're going to see, his dad was really tough on him. And I definitely think that Conrad emulated his dad, to some degree, with his own children. So it says, "Conrad's summer vacations were spent back in San Antonio, working for $5 a month at A.H. Hilton," that was the name of his dad's store. "An ever-growing business that now housed the post office, the telegraph office, the Studebaker dealership, a livery stable, and a lumber building materials operation. Gus Hilton was nothing, if not entrepreneurial. Not only was he managing the store, but he also bartered with prospectors, giving them provisions, clothing, food and money in return for a percentage of their profit." "On some days, he would take off into the wilderness to sell tobacco and food to beaver trappers, sometimes trading his goods for theirs. Gus was busy all of the time. Tough and unyielding, not only in business but at home as well. He expected a lot of his children. He actually saw something of himself in Connie, and wanted nothing more than to see the boy make something of himself. Therefore, he pressured him a great deal and was often critical when some observers felt it might have better served the boy to be encouraging."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this part about being really hard on his son, pressuring him a great deal to be successful and being critical, that -- you could say that paragraph that's talking about how Gus was to Conrad, same -- Conrad was exactly the same to, I would say, mainly to his two older boys, a lesser degree to his third son. But he has two boys, Nicky and Barron. And I think he would come to regret being this critical. Just remember, I said that for later on in the story, especially when it comes to Nicky because Nicky, he has a tragic ending to his life. Okay. But we're not there yet, we're still when Conrad is a young man. Okay. So he's working with his son. He's getting -- he's working extremely hard. He's around, let's see -- he's around, I think, 15 years old at this time. And they kept sending him to these different schools, he would drop out, not want to -- like he wanted to be at home learning from his father. And they would always -- especially his mother would overrule like his decision. He's like, "No, I can learn everything I need to know at home." So he actually finds inspiration from the biography of Helen Keller. So it says, "One day he found a copy of a book by Helen Keller, the 23-year-old Alabama native, who was handicapped after contracting scarlet fever as a baby. Late into the night in his room, he read her autobiography, it was called Optimism, the message of which he found transformative. Keller wrote, 'Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope'." So I would definitely say that Conrad internalized that lesson because he was definitely optimistic throughout his entire life, even when he had no reason to be, which is very difficult. "With a newfound courage gleaned from Keller's book, Conrad eventually announced to his parents that he would not be returning to school. His decision was final, he said, even though he was only 15. Gus responded without appearing to show the slightest sign of annoyance. 'All right,' he decided. 'I guess you'll be worth $25 a month on a full-time basis'." So now he's just sort of making $5, now he is making $25 because he is working full-time.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"I believe now, looking back, that my parents took note of my conviction and this encouraged them to change their minds." Okay. So this is interesting, though. So I just give you a description of all the different ventures that Gus was into. And I read them, I'm like, damn, that's like -- wouldn't it be better if you're just focused on one or two things. I mean, preferably one. And it turns out like it might have been a better strategy for old Gus. So this is how the first ever Hilton Hotel comes by, one, necessity and, two, accident. And then I'm going to go into the first few careers that Conrad had because it wasn't until he in his 30s that he actually discovered what it was going to be his life's work, which is hotel, to become a hotelier, I guess, is what they call it. Okay. "In 1907, the financial panic that came without warning hit the country and all but wiped out Gus Hilton's finances. Gathering his family about him, Gus spelled out the dire situation and asked for suggestions. Casting his eyes up on the floor, a 19-year-old Conrad, after a few moments of silence, looked up, broke into a smile and announced, 'We should open a hotel. Let's take five or six of our 10 rooms,' of the house that they lived in, 'and make a hotel. This place needs a hotel'." So what would happen is Gus had nine children. Every time a child was born, himself, he would build an addition to the house to house the extra Hilton child. And over time, now they have this big structure. It's not like a luxury structure by any means, but it does have room. And in the area they are in, there's a lot of prospectors, what they call them wildcatters, this is basically people looking to strike it rich with oil.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. So he says, "We should open a hotel," okay. "This place needs a hotel," meaning the city. "Conrad further suggested that while his father ran the hotel, his mother and sisters could handle the kitchen duty. And he, meaning Conrad, will be responsible for baggage. He further speculated that $2.50 a day for each bed would be a reasonable amount to charge guests. Much to his amazement, his father actually thought the idea might work." So they get to work right on it, right away. Within six weeks, news of the hotel spread throughout the area all the way to Chicago. He is saying, "Hey, if you're going to this little part of San Antonio, why don't you stay at the Hilton's?" And then he says, this is one of the -- I guess, the advertisements they did. He says, "They serve the best meals in the West and they have a boy there who is a crackerjack at making things comfortable for you," meaning Conrad. "Everyone got something out of our hotel. Travelers got cleanliness, comfort, and a good table for their $2.50 a day. We all worked hard and no one harder than my mother." I would -- and this is -- I should have told you, but this is a direct quote from Conrad. Now towards the end of his life, looking back at how important this lesson was for him. He said, "We all worked hard and no one harder than my mother. I wouldn't take $1 million for what those days taught me, and I'd give $1 million for one of the suppers that she served." Not only did Conrad manage the hotel, but he worked the desk, was the concierge, and did pretty much everything he could think of to keep the enterprise afloat. So there's going to be like a 10-year gap before he goes back into the hotel industry, but he is the exact same thing when he goes back into the industry. He knew -- remember that quote from Samuel Zemurray that I always referenced, the Banana King, where he's like, as long as you know -- there's no problem you can't solve if you know your business from A to Z, how he started peddling bananas. Bananas are about to go rotten. That's how he got a start. Then he literally went into every single section of -- from owning the land that the bananas were produced on to cultivating the bananas, to owning the ships that they were on, to owning just every single -- like the entire like vertically integrated corporation that he would need to actually eventually become the largest producer of bananas in the world.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But anyways, to a certain degree, Conrad emulated that in the sense that at the beginning of his career, he was not shy about -- he would be the maid, he would check you in. He would take care of your bags. He would do everything. So later on his life, he knew exactly -- like he was able to systematize like what an actual -- like a way to make like -- I would say, like a structure for hospitality to the degree where like he does a deal that he comes to regret later on in his life, where he sells off the rights to the Hilton brand overseas, so in like Asia and Europe in whatever cases. And the companies that had signed up and were doing joint ventures with him at that time canceled because they're like, "No, no, we want to do business with Conrad Hilton because we believe in his management structure on how to manage hotels," which he, of course, slowly learned over four decades. And he's like, "Now you're turning over the management of the hotels to these other people. We're not -- we don't want to do business with them. We want to do business with you." So anyways -- so he's doing everything he could to keep the enterprise afloat. "With the family solvent, thanks to Conrad's bright ideas, he enrolled at the New Mexico School of Mines in nearby Socorro," some little tiny town. So he didn't really like school, but what he learned there proved invaluable as he excelled at higher mathematics, providing the best possible mental muscles necessary, now direct quote from Conrad "for whatever career he would choose." So he s***** at school, but he really liked numbers. And again, this is something he carries with for rest of his life. Every day, he would read and analyze, even when he had, I think, tens of thousands of hotel rooms, he would read the profit and loss statements -- the daily profit and loss statements of every single hotel every day. He did this his entire life until the point where his eyesight was going bad. I think he was in like 70s or 80s this time. So he'd have to have somebody else read like the P&Ls to him, but he was obsessed with numbers.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. It says, "In 1911, when he was 24, the Territory of New Mexico was admitted to the Union." Again, I have to repeat like he did not know he was going to be a hotelier until he stumbles on to it by accident. It says, "Okay, well, we're going to go into the United States." So this has actually shocked me. It says, "Conrad entered the political arena. He was swiftly elected to a seat in the lower house of the new state's first legislature." He doesn't last long there. He says, "He found working as a lawmaker slow and dull." So he only serves one term there. The work was way too boring and he says, "Okay, returned to San Antonio more frustrated and more determined than ever to make it. He reasoned that since there was no bank in his small hometown, he would become a banker." This is something he wanted to do for a long time. "With about $30,000, $3,000 of his own and the rest scrounged up from friends and investors, Conrad opened the New Mexico State Bank of San Antonio in September 1913." He was just 26. So the reason I brought up the fact, first, it was surprising to me that he was a lawmaker, the youngest ever for State of New Mexico. But he met a lot of people in those 2 years that he was a lawmaker to the point where now he was well known in society, and he was able to -- people like kind of trusted him, even though he was really young. I mean think about being 26-year-old today and trying to start a bank, like that's -- it just sounds a little crazy, right? However, he was able to raise capital, but his dad had warned him previously. He's like this town is way too small for a bank, it's going to fail. That's exactly what happened. "So customers failed to materialize, and by year's end, the bank would close its doors. Another failure. Would his father always be right?" Conrad wondered. "Restless for new challenges, in 1916," this is another weird twist of events here.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Conrad at 29 years old took on the management of a musical group formed by his violin-playing sister, Eva, and two of her female friends, calling themselves the Hilton Trio. Conrad was certain that people would flock to see the trio," and there's more of his optimism. "Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Despite his best efforts, his first entrance into show business was a colossal failure." And I just want to, before I move on from there, same situation, not only was he their manager, but he was their agent and he was their roadie as well. So he did not shy away from doing hard work and he preferred to do everything himself. Okay. So then right around this time, that was in 1916. And the World War is going on, so in 1917, he's actually drafted into the Army. And because he has experience working in Gus's dry goods store, he is sent to France. And he's running basically, they call it the Quartermaster Corps. So he is not like on the front lines, but it's like basically managing all the supplies that the soldiers need. And he uses like this time as a learning experience. So it says, "Being in France gave Conrad a whole new worldview and expanded his scope of experience outside of his humble beginnings." This is a direct quote from him, "Before, I had been a big frog in a small pond. Now in Paris, I realized I was just a tadpole in a big ocean." So while he was sent away, I think he's 19 -- no, no, how old is he now, almost 30, yes, he's almost 30. He receives a devastating news. "He received a shocking telegram from his mother, telling him that his father had died and asking him to come home. He was shattered that he was unable to pay his last respects to the often critical father he still loved very much and respected deeply."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So what happened is actually his father owned the town's first automobile. It was actually a Ford model. And he was killed on New Year's day when he was -- the vehicle has failed to negotiate a turn in the road. And it was actually, the town they lived in, their first death by car accident. And it says, "Although Conrad knew full well that his father would have wanted him to take over the family business, he realized that San Antonio's boom days were over. If he ever were to make it big, it wouldn't be here." So now we got to the part of him finally finding his life's work. So it says, "Ironically, the automotive technology," and he does it by accident, we're going see here in a minute. "Ironically, the automotive technology that claimed the life of Conrad Hilton's father would be the impetus that would propel Conrad to his next venture, the oilfields of Texas. He wouldn't be a wildcatter, though. Instead, he would exploit the booming support apparatus that was springing up around the oil industry." So he wanted to sell pickaxes basically, using that metaphor that's widely known. It says, "With $5,000, his entire life savings, pinned to the inside of his coat, Conrad Hilton, now 32, soon after struck out for Texas." So I jumped ahead a little bit there. So his father undoubtedly wanted him to take over his business. But his mom, who is also a very strong and iron-willed woman, told him, "No, this town is not big enough for you," and she says, the quote from her that he remembers later on his life, she tells him, "You'll have to find your own frontier, Connie." Everybody called him Connie, by the way. And so this is the mindset that Conrad had at 32 because he's still hellbent on being successful, even though everything up until this point was a failure. "I thought, I dreamed, schemed of nothing but how to get a toehold in the amazing pageant that was Texas." So he winds up finding a bank. He does a deal. He's like, "Okay, I want to [ be member ], he still wants to be a banker, right? And he agrees in principle to a deal and then the person who owns a bank changes his mind. So now he's really down because he's just like this s_*_*. They agreed on a price. And then the guy is like, "No, no, I'm not going to do it anymore."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"So frustrated and bitterly disappointed, Conrad retreated to a nearby hotel called the Mobley to ponder his next move. The Mobley was a two-story redbrick down-in-the-dumps operation catering to the roughnecks who worked in the oilfields." And they're not joking. I even looked up what it looked like. Yes, a very humble beginnings to the Hilton empire. "When I first saw it," he would recall, "it looked like a convenient place to sleep. Nothing more." Despite its dilapidated condition, Conrad is astonished to find that the place was fully occupied with a waiting list of customers attracted to its low room costs." Remember, last week, we talked about Marc Andreessen's idea that the most important indicator or -- the most important thing that's correlated with success in business, it's not the product, it's not the founder, it's the market in his opinion. And he's saying, like, "When you have a market that is growing, like somebody is going to satisfy that market. It has to be satisfied, so it might as well be you." The Mobley is kind of down-in-the-dumps crappy little 2-story building. But the owner at the time had nothing but demand because he's in a good market, right? So it says," Conrad was astonished to find that the place was fully occupied with a waiting list of customers attracted to its low room cost." Not only that, he had people -- he had three separate customer segments here. He said, people that would rent it by the hour, the day and then like longer, like weeks or months. It says, "Though the Mobley had the appearance of a flophouse," that was the word I was looking for, it's a flophouse, "Conrad still saw a great promise in it. He became even more enthused about the 40-room facility than he had been about the possibility of striking it rich in the oil industry. Therefore, when he learned that the Mobley's’ proprietor wanted to sell it and enter the oilfields himself, Conrad made an offer of $40,000."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

That's the $40,000 that I referenced at the opening of the podcast. "This, his second foray into the hotel business, would be the decision of a lifetime for young Conrad. He seemed to know it, too. When the deal was completed, he sent his mother a telegram, 'Frontier found. Water deep down here. Launched first ship in Cisco'." So he definitely had like this Southern -- not only a Southern accent but a Southern-like vocabulary. Even when he was living in L.A. and he owned a bunch of them -- some of the most famous hotels in New York, he routinely appeared with like a cowboy hat on, it's kind of funny. "There was one thing Conrad Hilton knew for sure was important, the careful utilization," this is so important -- super important about his dedication to efficiency and not waste. And it's weird that you see these corporations nowadays, they do the opposite. They overindulge themselves when they're successful. It says, "There was one thing Conrad Hilton knew for sure was important, the careful utilization of space. To that end, he ripped out the lobby and sectioned it off into bedrooms. He then reduced the size of the front desk by half and added a retail shop. Removing three chairs and a sofa from another section of the lobby, he installed a newsstand." He was -- I mean, you guys will see, he had -- he survived the Great Depression for God's sake, and he would never claim bankruptcy. I heard a recording of his voice, he is saying that like, he felt that 80% of the hotels in America went bankrupt during the Great Depression. And he felt that him claiming bankruptcy would be admitting quitting and he just would -- he refused to quit. But this whole idea of -- this modus operandi that he is doing on his first hotel, he does over and over again. He constantly will buy like a dilapidated hotel or a hotel that's like down and out and just revamp it. And then usually, he would just realize these people don't know what they're doing. They don't know how to run a hotel, like they're not using their space. Like your space is what you're paying for when you buy a hotel. Why are you not using it? So again, like something that's obvious in hindsight, but for some reason, so many people running the businesses didn't see it.

"It was with the Mobley that Hilton began to understand that a staff of contented employees usually resulted in a thriving business. He began to encourage regular meetings with the staff, listening to all their concerns and taking care of each as best he could. Caring about his employees and viewing them as people with families and lives of their own rather than merely his charges would become an integral way of doing business for Conrad, and in years to come, would account for much of his success as a hotelier." Isn't it very similar to what we talked about last week with Henry Kaiser. He's like, "Listen, we're in the construction business. This is hard labor, like in some of the most unforgiving climates in the world. And it's so expensive for us to train all these employees to do the job the way we want them done. If we don't invest in them, then our turnover is going to be higher, and that means that we're going to have to pay more money in training. Like why don't we just take care of the employees that we have." You're seeing the same exact thing here for Conrad. "He soon outlined for his employees, his personal guidelines for success, and then asked that they adhere to them. His code could easily apply today, almost 100 years later," more than 100 years later now, "as one for better living. As he put it at the time," direct quote from him, "find your own particular talent. Be big. Be honest. Live with enthusiasm. Don't let your possessions possess you. Don't worry about your problems. Look up to people when you can and down to no one. Don't cling to the past. Assume your full share of responsibility in the world and finally, pray consistently and constantly." He says, whole thing about being big. He tells it to his kids over and over again. Be big, be the bigger person. And he also applied it to like their own ambitions. Okay. So his first hotel is a wild success. And Conrad is not the kind of person that sits around. He moves extremely fast.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Now that can obviously be a great trait, but probably not a good idea to expand rapidly when, in a few years from now, you're going to run into the largest financial recession or financial depression that your country has ever seen. But he doesn't know that yet. So he's doing just as his personality allows. "So he decided that he would focus on his new passion. In doing so, his success would be like a juggernaut that could not be stopped. By 1923, Hilton had more than 500 rooms in Texas in different small hotels that he had purchased along the way." So that, if I'm not mistaken, is he goes from 40 rooms to 500 in 4 years. I think I have those years correct. So he had -- Hilton had more than 500 rooms -- sorry, I don't know if I just said 400, I meant to say 500. "500 rooms in Texas in different small hotels he had purchased along the way. Because these were all dilapidated establishments that appear to be on the verge of closing, Conrad was able to get them for a steal." He even does this later on a life where he gets a hotel that costs like, I think it costs over $1 million to build in Chicago, maybe in the '40s, and he gets it for like $250,000. So this is definitely something like a strategy he keeps during his whole life. "He would then invest in renovating them with his own special touches," this is what I was mentioning earlier, "turning extra space and lobbies into rooms or in some cases, bars, closets into gift shops, and before long, they were all turning a profit. Once Conrad was making about $100,000 a year," that's an astounding amount of money for -- just after a few years in the 1920s, "he began to fantasize about building a hotel that would bear his own name. It didn't take long for that dream to come true." "Conrad broke ground for the Dallas Hilton on January 26, 1924. He was 37 years old." Okay. So that's the first one he builds. That's not the biggest one I was referencing earlier, though. I think that one was in -- oh, wait, no, that was the one. Okay. So let me get into -- he's going to -- he loses it all very, very quickly here.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Conrad Hilton was having a good run. Unfortunately, it wouldn't last. Everything was about to come to a crashing halt in October 1929 with the onslaught of the Great Depression. Now there were far fewer traveling businessmen. The Depression couldn't have happened at a worse time for Conrad. He was right in the middle of building the Dallas Hilton." I thought that it was -- so he broke ground in 1924, so it took 5 years to build? Okay. So I was mistaken about that. This was the hotel. "As things went from bad to worse, in less than a year, he found himself deeply in debt, having lost all but one of his hotels." Okay. So hold on one second. I got to move my notes here. Okay. So within a year, you see that he's expanding fast, gets to a ton of hotel rooms. And then within one year, obviously, he's buying all these -- he's buying all these properties that he was expanding for the last 5 or 6 years, but he's doing it with debt. So it says, "As things went from bad to worse, in less than a year, he found himself deeply in debt, having lost all but one of his hotels." And the one he didn't lose was the grand – the El Paso Hilton. "At $500,000 in debt, he was all but ruined. The rapid speed by which things had taken a turn was stunning. 'I was heartsick about it.' He would later recall. 'But of course, everyone in business was facing ruination at this time in our history. I had a sense that if I could just survive this, I could survive anything'." And this is probably the most important, at least for me -- probably the most important lesson that I took away from Conrad Hilton was just his actions that he took during this time was nothing short of extraordinary. The -- like the will and the perseverance that this guy had. I mean if he would have lost it, there would have never been Hilton empire. He did everything he could, just he's like, "Listen, I'll lose all my other hotels. I'll get them back later, but I can't lose this one."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. So he says, "Listen, if I could just survive this, I could survive anything." He winds up being true -- that winds up being true. "Conrad was still a determined man even in the face of so much adversity. He believed that if he could at least keep the El Paso Hilton in business, he might actually be able to ride out the Depression. He was the kind of man who always believed that no bad situation to be permanent." Again, another trait, I think, that we should all steal. So this is -- so he has his Hilton, but again, the El Paso Hilton, but it's not going to be at full capacity because no one's really traveling. So this is what he does. It says, "Conrad had some of the rooms of the El Paso Hilton boarded up. He cut back on heating, electricity, whatever he could think of to lower his overhead." So he's got this $40,000 lease payment coming up on the property. And if he doesn't make it, he's going to like have to -- they're going to foreclose on him. So he hears about this bank in Missouri is willing to loan him the money. He takes a prop plane out there, which is a really expensive way to travel at the time. Once he gets there, the banker said he changed his mind. So now he's at -- he's just frantic. He's like, "This is it. This is the end of line." So he goes back to Texas to begin brainstorming with the group of his suppliers and his mother. This is such a smart move that he does here. So he meets with all the people that he's buying supplies to run his hotel and his mom, who is still living at the hotel at the time. And he says, "He promised that if they each contributed $5,000 to help him out of this tight spot, he would do business with them for as long as he was a hotel owner." So they agreed because, again, if he is buying dairy, buying all this other stuff from them, they're going to make -- as long as he survives, they'll make that money back and then some over the course of their relationship with the hotel. And he honors his agreement, of course. So they agree. And it says, "Had he not made that payment, he would have most certainly lost his empire right then and there."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So that's just a crazy story to me because you're talking about $40,000, and that is the -- what his entire -- what he's able to accomplish later on in life all hinges there. If they say, 'no, I can't do it' or 'no, I don't have the money', where in the case is, that property is foreclosed, we may never know the name of Conrad Hilton or the Hilton Hotel brand, right? And then you'd think of like not only did he have like a really rough starting point in life in general, but he gets to his peak in his early 30s, then goes all the way back down to essentially close to 0. And then from there, still builds back up, and then the company is massive. I think when they -- there's a private -- I think it was Blackstone private equity group bought Hilton for like $20 billion, if I'm not mistaken. So I mean that's just astonishing to me. Okay. So he says, "Though he managed to save the El Paso Hilton, he was still in big trouble." Yes. So not only does he owe like the money in the lease, but he owe suppliers. And so one -- in this example, like he gets taken to court. "Conrad owed just $178 to a furniture company, and they took him to court for that debt. At that point, his attorneys strongly encouraged him to declare bankruptcy. Pounding his fists on his desk during more than a few meetings with those same lawyers, Hilton steadfastly refused. He insisted that the situation was just temporary and he was going to wait it out. Over 80% of the hotels in America went bankrupt during the Depression." "All of the creditors, if they wanted to, could have called in their notes and totally wiped him out, but many of them realized that he was doing the best he could under horrible circumstances. They had faith in him, and plus he was a good barterer like his dad. For instance, there was a dairy supplier in El Paso, whose bill was due, and Conrad said, 'Look, if you just extend me more credit, as long as I'm operating a hotel here, I'll buy all my dairy products from you'. And he did for many years. He never forgot."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he survives a Great Depression. "America got back on her feet. And as she did, Hilton's small empire also began to recover. Because he had so stubbornly refused to default on his many bills, he found his reputation greatly enhanced among creditors and future backers. They all wanted to sell to Conrad Hilton because he was the one who didn't declare bankruptcy. This was partly how he was able to acquire so many hotels in the future." So this theme keeps popping up in these books that it's so important not to quit because future opportunities compound. And if you give up now in year one or year two or year five, you don't know what those opportunities in year 20 look like. We saw this last week again with Henry Kaiser, when he was having a hard time, basically wasn't -- wasn't able to -- like wasn't really making a profit, but he kept this -- kept paying his employees, kept them loyal to him, when he had that paving company up in like Vancouver. And that paving company, the work that the paying company did over a series of years, I think it was like 12 or 13 years, opened up for an opportunity to be a subcontractor building roads in Cuba, which that one contract gave his company way more money than all the -- then the 13 years of being a paver did. So again, he wouldn't have reached that huge opportunity that happened in year 13, it might be year 12, I don't remember the exact one, but you get the point. That he wouldn't have had that giant opportunity in year 13 if he didn't understand like playing for the long-term and doing the right thing in year 4 and 5. The same thing is happening to Conrad because if he were to claim bankruptcy, his creditors wouldn't have got $1 or they would have got a greatly reduced amount of money. And again, those opportunities compounded in the future where he's able to get these -- like here, let's see -- the Sir Francis Drake in San Francisco, he gets for $275,000.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I think he has assumed some of the debt, but it was -- it cost $4.1 million to build. So he keep collecting properties like this, not only to make income, but you're paying 1/10 of the price it cost to build them or 1/20 or whatever the number is, like that's how you accumulate wealth over a long period of time. So it's kind of how Conrad did at least. Okay. So now where are we at? Okay. So this is -- he's older, wiser and more cautious. Now we're in the 1940s, okay? So "On December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. On December 28, Conrad went to New York at the behest of his friend, Arnold Kirkeby, a good friend who is the founder of the Kirkeby hotel chain. He says, 'I've got this bug in my ear about the hotel Pierre', he told Conrad. 'What do you think about going into a little joint venture?' Ordinarily, Conrad would not have been able to resist at least closely examining the possibility of acquiring another hotel, but at this particular time, he thought it best to be prudent." Now, why is he saying that? Because the America was just attacked. Clearly, there's going to be a war going on. So he says, "With the country at war and the battleground now extending to America's own shores, no one knew quite what to expect." At the least, he suspected that vacation travel would decline. "Conrad agreed to do an inspection of the Fifth Avenue Hotel in order to gauge the possibility." And the reason he's doing this because this is a goal of his that he harbored for many, many years. "Making it big in New York was still a major goal of his. All of his success somehow seemed insignificant to him when he thought of the valuable real estate in New York and how much he wanted a piece of that action." "Conrad could talk to almost anybody about almost anything, though he counted," and this is a little bit about his personality, I have to switch gears here. "Though he counted as friends many distinguished and important heads of state and governments, one of the great paradoxes of his personality was that he was fundamentally quite shy. I think he had friends for different purposes. He'd have a friend to play golf with, a friend to ride horses with, a friend to do various things with, play cards, that sort of thing. But he didn't have a lot of close friends. He was, to a large extent, a private man."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"They had forged genuine relationships with spouses and partners with whom they were now happily sharing their lives. Maybe none of them had his money, but they seemed to have much more. When he put his life under heavy scrutiny, he didn't like what he saw. If only he had been at home with his sons, perhaps he would have felt better about these things." So again, this is a paradox of people. And we've seen this many times, especially when these autobiographies that the entrepreneurs write towards the end of their lives. The reason I bring this up is because like not only we want to learn about like entrepreneurship on this podcast, but we want to learn about life because entrepreneurship is just a small segment, a sub, like a small part, an important part, don't get me wrong, of your overall life. And it's just, I think, like -- it's helpful for me to bring to my own attention that no matter what kind of success you can have in business that like you have to have a well-rounded life to achieve like satisfaction. I'm not going to use the word happiness because I think happiness is temporary. But just looking back at your life when you're 70, 80 years old, hopefully, you live too much longer than that, but like I'm satisfied. I like the decisions I made. I'm not going to live with regrets. And I definitely feel after reading this book that Conrad had those regrets up until the time he meets his final wife. But I think they got married when he was, let's say -- let me just say 87, he dies at 91. I'm sure he wanted the love of his life much -- for a much larger point of his life. At least he did find it, though. But this is going to -- there is several parts of this book where Conrad is extremely upset at himself for how he -- for not taking the time to develop relationships and realizing that, yes, you could have -- he literally had the largest hotel company in the world, and he's depressed. So we're humans. We need more than just success.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I guess I bring that up because I think a lot of people think, "Oh, they're rich. Oh, they're successful. Like what do they have to complain about?" But we see that's not true. I mean the two examples that just came to mind right now while I was sitting here thinking about that passage is, I mean look at the people who had tons of success in the world that killed themselves. The two that come to mind right now is Kate Spade, founder of Kate Spade, and Anthony Bourdain, and it's hard to find two more successful people and more loved people. And yet, because of like internal struggles, like they chose to end their own lives. So I don't know, it's just important to bring that up because I think that some people might see these books as like we're idolizing these people, and we're not, we're learning from them. And we're learning the good things, and we're also learning, in a lot of cases, like what not to do. So with -- I think if Conrad was alive today and he could talk to you directly, he would say, "Hey, listen, I screwed this up. Invest, find like the love of your life." He had kids. He had a strong relationship with them, but he severely missed a large part of what it is to be human. All right. So now the book is going to go a little bit back in timeline because we're going to talk about like the Great Depression's effect on not only his business but his marriage. And this is something because he was married -- this is something he was very -- like tormented him throughout his whole life. It says, "Before the end of the 1920s, he was well ahead of his goal of acquiring at least one hotel a year." So now just we're going to list off -- I'm just going to list off, instead of telling you where they're at, I'm just going to tell you how many rooms he buys. So 100 rooms cost $400,000; 100 rooms costing -- another 100 rooms costing $400,000; 40 rooms costing $900,000; 200 rooms costing $800,000. This is all the acquisitions before the Great Depression. And then -- so now -- so this is -- he's got -- not only is like the Great Depression about to happen, but his best friend dies.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It says, "A family strategy struck when Conrad's younger brother was struck down with tuberculous meningitis. His death rocked the family and Conrad had lost his best friend." So there were tough times. He's trying to save all hotels. So as a result of that, he began spending a great deal of time away from home. "He was trying to come up with imaginative ways to remain solvent. At one point, matters became so dire that he considered borrowing against his life insurance policy." 'Of course, you must do it,' Mary advised." Mary is his first wife. This bad – and the mother of his first three children. "Mary advised him, 'This bad spell will not last forever', echoing his own philosophy. 'And when it's over, you'll come out on the other side bigger and better than ever'. He borrowed against the policy and used that money to stay afloat." "Soon the money he had borrowed against the policy ran out and Hilton was right back to where he had started from, trying desperately to save his empire. Every day was an uphill climb. It wore him down. 'Don't you dare give up', his mother told him. 'Some men jump out windows, some quit, some go to church. Some pray. So pray harder, Connie'. Meanwhile, as things continued to go from bad to worse, Conrad's wife became more restless. She now claimed that Conrad was distant and inattentive. Making matters even more complex, though, Conrad had just opened a new hotel and he couldn't afford his own home." So he gives up his house. "Therefore, he moved his family into a suite in a new El Paso Hilton. Mary wasn't happy about any of it. None of it made sense to her. And as far as she was concerned, it suggested that Conrad was more devoted to the solvency of his hotel empire than he was to her and the security of their family." So they have two sons at this time, and they're all living in the hotel.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so now we're going to see the -- what Mary is talking about because we're going to get some notes from his own diary. And this is, of course, going to lead to divorce. So this is rather sad, Conrad's wife was like 15 years younger than him at the time. She felt she wasn't getting attention and she starts having an affair with like a football coach. And even after that, Connie didn't want a divorce because he was strict catholic and you're not allowed to do divorce. It says, "Connie wasn't a quitter. He tried and, in all fairness, so did Mary. Then much to everyone's amazement, Mary ended up pregnant in October '32. Nine months later, little Eric was born. However, in Conrad's diary, he seems oddly indifferent toward the event. 'Mary expecting a baby', he noted simply. He is just as unsentimental in his entry on July 1, 1933. Eric Michael Hilton, born at St. Paul's at 10:00 a.m. Then immediately thereafter, 'Must get something solid to show Greenwood. I know I can straighten that hotel out if only I get the chance. No time to stop off and see Mary or the baby. Called everyone I could think of as a substitute banker. My time's running out'." That was a really fascinating part of the book to me, it was -- what he's writing to himself in his own diary in arguably the worst time of his life. And so later on in life, Conrad has a fourth daughter by Zsa Zsa Gabor. But he knows the daughter is not his, because he had already been divorced from Zsa Zsa at that time and it had been like 18 months since they had sexual -- what he calls, sexual relations. And yet he didn't want to like -- he called her his daughter the whole time, but there's like a stuff in his will and notes that he writes to attorneys and so on and so forth, where he's like, "Listen, I know this is not my daughter." He calls her his daughter, she calls him daddy, but he knows it's not his'.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

But again, he considers her one of his children. So that's, I guess, a whole separate part of the story. But the reason I bring this up now is because there's a good chance Eric is not his son either. He never says anything like he does about Francesca, explicitly saying, "Hey, no, this is not mine." But his wife is having an affair, he's not there, they're about to get divorced. He's never home and she winds up pregnant. So a lot of people suspected that it's not his kid, but he never said anything about it. And he took care of them and Eric winds up working in his company, too. And the guy, Mack. Mary divorces Conrad, marries Mack, and Mack dies from a heart attack at like 47. So at that time, Eric, I think is a teenager and so he spends a lot of time with -- I shouldn't say a lot of time, Conrad kind of looks after him as own son. And you know it's weird too like after they get divorced, Conrad gets custody of his two older sons, Nicky, the first born, and Barron, the second. But then lets Eric live with Mack and Mary. That kind of insinuates that he kind of knows. But anyways, "Mary had enough. She announced that if Conrad didn't file for divorce, she would have to do it. For his marriage to end in divorce proved a torturous proposition for a man who, by his own admission, started every single day on his knees in church. He would make no mention of the possibility of Mary's indiscretion anywhere in his memoir, choosing instead to keep his and her dignity intact." So that's another thing. He's a very formal person. So even if he didn't want to like -- he was rather famous at the time, he's not going to have a custody fight. There was no really way to test paternity according to the book. I haven't looked into the accuracy of those claims, but I think Francesca was born in like the '40s? So he just kind of accepted it. So this is the end result of his divorce.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Conrad Hilton was never quite the same after the divorce. He was a proud man whose ego had been crushed by the dissolution of his marriage." So now he was a proud person individually, but he also knew that like in eyes of God, he was a disappointment. Okay. So here's a little bit on his personality and an advice on business decision-making from Conrad. "If someone were to have told him that he couldn't purchase a luxury hotel in which he was emotionally invested, he would become all the more determined to make that property his own. It was just the way he trafficked in the world. People thought a lot of things about him, none of which were opinions that mattered much to him. He had always lived his life on his own terms," which I think is extremely important. "Throughout his lifetime, Conrad had often stated that his secret weapon in business was his close spiritual relationship to his God. He had made each of his major hotel decisions only after a great deal of prayerful deliberation. He fervently believed he would be guided in the right direction if he simply asked for such guidance. 'It's not enough to just pray,' he once observed. 'You have to be able to listen. Call it intuition or call it gut instinct, call it what you will, but I recognize that little voice we all have in our heads as being the answer to our prayers. You have to be willing to listen and then make decisions based on what the voice is telling you'. 'A major problem, as I see it anyway', he continued, 'is that many of us have not worked to cultivate that certain inner voice. We make snap decisions. Many of us don't even think, we just react to situations at hands. I have found that this isn't the way'."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I think that's a hugely important idea. And I like how he says, "Listen, I call it God, I call it prayer. You might call it meditation, you might call it instinct, whatever it is, just like that inner voice, that's what I call it, like you know what it is that you should be doing, you know. You might lie to yourself and make excuses for why you can't do it or why it hasn't happened yet, but you know what it is." And I think like no one is going to be truly satisfied when they get to their -- let's use -- okay, let's take a step back here, right? Let's -- one of the best ideas from The Everything Store, the book on Jeff Bezos, is that, that idea that, that framework he uses to make decisions, which I think is hugely valuable, and he calls it in typical geeky terms, the regret minimization framework. And so when he -- to give you some context, in case you haven't heard me talk about this, even though I read it up all the time, because I think it's worn idea is, he's in his 20s, he's hugely successful working at a quantitative hedge fund in Manhattan, has a wife, has a beautiful apartment in the Upper West Side, making a ton of money and then he's like, "I'm going to quit because the Internet is I've never seen anything that grows that fast." I forgot what the percentage was. But year-over-year at that time was like, let's say, 20,000%, whatever the number. It was just some crazy number like that. And how he arrived at the decision and then he made, he is like, "Listen, I just knew that if I'm sitting on my death bed in my 80s or 90s and I'm looking back, I would regret not taking part and playing a part in the age of the Internet. On the other side, I knew for a fact that when you're 80 or 90 and your reflecting back in your life, you're not going to be like, oh, I wish I stayed another year or six months to get that bonus, like that's just not things that you would even contemplate." So I like that idea of filtering your decisions through the future you that's towards the end of your life making that decision. Like what would he think or she think of a decision I'm about to make now. And a lot of that comes from knowing yourself like what is really important to you, like the idea. Everybody told Jeff, like you're going to quit? You're wildly successful, you're working for this really smart eccentric billionaire. The world -- like you have all these opportunities knocking your door, you're relatively young and you're going to quit to sell books on the Internet?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And now we obviously see how that played out. But even if it didn't play out, let's say Amazon just stayed a successful bookstore on Internet and it didn't expand to what it is now, obviously, making him one of the richest people in the world, he still wouldn't -- I don't think he still would have regretted just staying and working for somebody else instead of going out and just trying to work in an industry that he feel extremely passionate about. So the inner voice, what Conrad is saying here is like, "Listen, it's just not -- we're making snap decisions. Many of us don't even think, we just react to situations in hand. I found that this is not the way. So not only like take your time to think, but listen to the results of the computation that your brain is making." Part of the reason why I try to read some of these books, sometimes they just -- they take a long time, but I try to split them over several days as much as I can because I want more time for these ideas to sit in my brain because that's going to make it easier when I sit down and try to talk to you about the key insights and what I learned from this is like making sure that like it just sits in my brain, let these computation -- these like -- these cycles of computation happen. Let me go have several times of sleep. Let it really get in there, so I'm able to hopefully make this as valuable as possible for you. I love Conrad's idea of practice. I just started reading -- just again, I may make it -- it's a weird book that I'm going to bring up, but I may make it like a [reviewer-only] episode or something like that or maybe a bonus episode for Misfits. I don't know what I'm going to do with it. But it's Kobe Bryant's book Mamba Mentality, because I think the way he was, like dedicated to the practice aspect of his craft, physical training aspect of his craft, all the stuff that was not the actual games and the level of dedication that you put into that, I think that can make you successful in any domain. It just happened he chose basketball, but you could choose a company, you could choose whatever it is that you want to do. But I particularly like the idea that Conrad looked at things like practice.

So now skipping ahead, "When Hilton acquired the 1,012-room Roosevelt Hotel in the spring of 1943 and announced the purchase to a close friend. His friend was only able to muster one word, 'Why'? 'Because it's a fine hotel and because I've got to practice', responded Conrad. 'Practice for what'? 'For the Waldorf', Conrad said. It's not – 'I'm not quite ready for that one yet'. Long before the term multitasking became part of our lexicon, it epitomized Hilton's octopus like juggling act, keeping several projects going at the same time." So he fantasized about owning the Waldorf. He wouldn't use the word fantasized. He would say he dreamed. He talked about -- a lot to his sons about the importance of dreaming, having dreams and then going about and trying to realize those dreams. But Waldorf-Astoria, he felt was the finest hotel in the world. And I think it took him like two decades until he finally owned it. But I liked his idea. He is like, 'I'm going to buy this because it's a big luxury hotel. It's not the best in the world, but it's one of the best in the world, and it's going to serve as a practice for when I actually achieve my dreams'. I don't know, I find that to be fascinating that he used that term. Okay. So this is Conrad's philosophy on money, which I find really interesting. And he's married to Zsa Zsa Gabor at the time. She is like 30 years younger than him. He said this is one of the dumbest things he ever did in his life. But he says, "Conrad fully understood that Zsa Zsa enjoyed spending money, and he certainly had a lot of it to spend. The question for him wasn't whether or not he could afford to subsidize her extravagant taste, it was whether or not it made sense to him. He quickly realized that Zsa Zs didn't understand the value of money. He had worked hard for his wealth and he continued to work for it. What did she do to earn a living? Nothing really."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The question of finances would always be an issue in Conrad's relationship with others, especially with family members. To him, it was a simple black and white matter. He had earned his money fair and square, and he wasn't giving it away to any -- giving away to anyone, even to family members. Some would say that he was incredibly cheap. In his own mind, however, this wasn't the case. Proof of his generous nature, he would often -- to prove his generous nature, he would offer up the names of the many charities to which he regularly donated. Would a cheap man be so philanthropic? He had few limits when it came to giving money to charities, especially to catholic aid organizations." "However, when it came to his family members as well as friends, he believed that they, all of them, should demonstrate a work ethic similar to his own, earn their own way and not expect to benefit from his own station in life. Moreover, he felt it wasn't even fair." This is such an interesting concept. And I think he might be -- when I originally read the book, I was like, "God, this guy is being kind of like a d_*_ for no reason." But it's not like -- that to me, I think I was being unfair, like it was an unfair characterization of him. Because like the one example like his daughter like wasn't -- she didn't want to live with her mother, she is having problems and said, 'Can I please live here'? And even though she was like 24 at the time, he's like, he's living in this like 20,000 square foot house, he tells her no, because there's no room in it. It's not that there wasn't room, it's like he felt it was like her own responsibility to provide shelter for herself. And the reason I say it's probably unfair is because he believed -- well, let me just read this.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Moreover, he felt it wasn't even fair to give them money. His financing of their lives would, he felt, be detrimental to them in the long run, eroding any motivation they might have to achieve wealth on their own and also diminish their appreciation for the value of the dollar." So he uses this word over and over again. Not in this book but in other like other research I was doing about him. He called it like the destruction, like when rich people give their kids a lot of money, he says it destroys them. So in this -- in the bookcase, he is saying, like it's destroying their work ethic. But he's saying, no, it destroys them as people. It makes them turn to drugs and alcohol and all the other. He was rather -- even though he drank, but rather religious pious kind of person. So he definitely thought -- after finishing the book, I kind of understood his thoughts. And some people say, "Hey, you gave 1% of your assets to your family and the people that served you for a long time." Some people might think that's low and unfair, but he did give 99% to people that actually needed it and people trying to heal sick kids, people that were ill, stuff like that. So I don't know, he was a very complicated man, I guess, is my point. Okay. "So fueling his philosophy of money, no doubt, was that Conrad had survived the Great Depression. He knew what it was like to lose everything and work hard to get it all back." So this is a little bit more about his personality, which I found fascinating. This is -- he is still married to Zsa Zsa at the time. And she was a young -- she was really young. She's like a kid when they met basically, and he's a grown man, 30 years her senior. He tried to put her on a budget. She didn't know what to do. She is a gold digger, let's just call what it is. She is married nine times, only married rich people and divorced them for money. But she says -- this is Conrad.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He says, "Glamour, I found, is expensive," he later recalled, "and Zsa Zsa was glamour raised to the last degree." Another issue that was raised for Conrad was that he viewed, oh this is -- so this is more -- let me -- this is me kind of expounding on the idea that he was dedicated to like the service of others, which he definitely was. It says, "Another issue that was raised for Conrad was that he viewed Zsa Zsa as inherently self-involved. He was a man who lived his life trying to find ways to be of service and through many philanthropic efforts fueled by his businesses, he sought to contribute to society, which he definitely did. Whether it would be the simple goodwill measure of speaking about prayer to a large assembly, as he often did, or whether it had to do with making sure people in foreign countries were able to support their families by virtue of their jobs with his hotels, he truly cared about his fellow man. It wasn't an act." So when Zsa Zsa would come to him and say, "Hey, I need money for mink coats and all this other stuff." He's like, "First of all, you're out of your damn mind. And second, why don't you go -- instead of asking me for money, go serve less fortune people." So he's like, "Why don't you go to soup kitchens to serve homeless people?" And she was -- I mean the book does not -- the book makes her look as basically a terrible person. She didn't give a s_*_ about charity. She didn't care about other people. She didn't even like -- she wouldn't even raise her daughter correctly because she was so self-involved with her like her show business career. And instead of spending time with her daughter, she would be off with like this new husband living in Europe for a little bit and then they divorce after a few months or a year. And then instead of spending more time with her daughter, she would go off and find another man. She is just really a terrible person. I can't imagine like having to be around her to the point where he's on his death bed in the hospital suffering, about to die from pneumonia, and she -- the family is like, no, you guys have been divorced for 30-something years, like you need to ask the Hilton family if you can visit him, and she wouldn't take no for answers, she tried to show up there. She had to be physically escorted out of there.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And it turns out like she wanted to see him before he died to make sure that he leaves money for her and her daughter in his will. I mean that's just -- that's repugnant human behavior by somebody that's so self-involved, someone that cannot look outside of their own like -- it's just amazing. And he gave her money throughout his life like he didn't -- like not a lot of money, but he would help her like get her own deals. He would negotiate with agents and stuff on her behalf, never take $1. And after he dies, 20 years later, she says that his daughter, Francesca, which is -- she says, this is the daughter they had together, which, of course, you can't have a daughter with somebody when you haven't had sex with him for 18 months. And she writes a memoir in like the '90s saying that he raped her and that Francesca was a product of rape and like that's clearly not true. So she is just a terrible human being. All right. And then this is how Zsa Zsa described Conrad. "There is no other man like this one. He has only one passion in his life, Hilton hotels." So I would -- there's so many other stories I'm obviously skipping over like this is a massive book. And like there's just so much more. I'm focusing mainly on the parts that have to do with Conrad and his business, but I'll tell you more at the end what I particularly enjoyed about the book because I was rather melancholic when I finished it. Okay. So this is the important to have friends around you to increase your ambition, a good strategy, and a great quote. Okay. So he's thinking about buying hotels in Chicago. This is before he makes his move to New York. It says, "For advice, he called upon his friend, Henry Crown, a successful businessman who had made a fortune with his Material Service Corporation. That's the name of the company that he founded." Henry Crown is in this book a lot, so much to the point where I went and looked for like a biography of his. I haven't found it yet. So if you run across it, please let me know.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, "Material Service Corporation, which sold gravel, lime, and coal to builders in Chicago. In his meeting with Crown, Hilton said that he'd been negotiating to purchase the Stevens Hotel, but he was having no luck with the owner. He said that he'd come to the conclusion that the sale simply wasn't going to happen. And so now he had set his sights on the Palmer House, which is another hotel in Chicago." What I want to bring up there is he is -- before he started having this conversation with Henry Crown, Conrad is negotiating with the owner of the Stevens Hotel and they come to an agreement and they even have a handshake agreement. It's like, okay, he's like, "I'll sell the hotel to you, but I want to make a $500,000 profit on it, so you have to pay $500,000 more than I have invested in it." Conrad said, "okay." Then the guy disappears for a few weeks. He comes, "Oh, I changed my mind. I want to make $650,000." Conrad said, "okay," because he really wants his hotel. It's like -- I think it might have been the largest hotel in the world at the time. The Army was actually using it during World War II for like Army barracks or whatever. But then the guy disappears again for a few weeks. He comes back, "Now I want to make $1 million profit." And so Conrad was, "okay." And then the guy disappears again. This is just not going to happen, this guy is jerking me around. So it says, "He said he is having no luck with the owner. He said that he had come to a conclusion the sale simply wasn't going to happen. So now he wants the Palmer House. 'Well, is the Palmer House even for sale'? Crown wondered. 'I don't know', replied Hilton. 'Well, find out, my good man', said Crown. 'And if so, why not buy both the Palmer and the Stevens'? Conrad didn't even have that idea in his mind yet." "At that bold suggestion, Conrad had to smile. Henry Crown was a man much like himself, someone who saw no reason his wildest ambitions could not be attained. He had already made a fortune in the construction business and held interests in banks, electronics, and the oil business as well as railroad and shipbuilding enterprises. He also owned real estate in Illinois, California, and New York. In just a few years, he would go on to own the Empire State Building, then the world's tallest skyscraper."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Hilton made an offer, so now the Hilton is negotiating with the owner of Palmer House. This is the guy name Hollis. "Hilton made an offer to Hollis for $18.5 million for the Palmer House, contingent upon him taking a look at the hotel's financial and tax records and the rest of the corporation's books." So I'm bringing this up because this also tells you kind of like the integrity with which Conrad did business. "However, when it came to Hollis' attention that Hilton had also been trying to buy the Stevens, he balked, saying that the Palmer House trustees would not allow its hotel books to be viewed by anyone who could one day turn out to be the competition for them. Hilton impressed upon Hollis that he had no success in purchasing the Stevens and that as far as he was concerned, it just wasn't going to happen. So Hollis lets him see the books." While he does this, he has a really good strategy. Conrad asked his assistant, this guy name Keith that's working for him or that's his last name. His name is Willard Keith. He says, "Hey, I have an idea," Conrad said, "Why don't you set up a little meeting with your friend, Mr. Healy," that's the guy that owns the Stevens Hotel, "and find out what the hell is going on with him and his Stevens Hotel?" And I think you know where I'm going here that, it's kind of human nature when you can't have something, you're going to want it more. And so he's going to try to get Keith to tell Mr. Healy, he is like, oh, no this deal is over, like he's already moved on, like it's too late, you missed your chance. It says, "As directed, over drinks, Keith said that Healy -- Keith told Healy that he had blown it with Hilton where the Stevens was concerned, that Conrad had gotten tired of his waffling and had abandoned the idea of ever purchasing the hotel. His mind was now set on the Palmer House, and there was no changing it. If it was a ploy, it worked. Now Healy wanted to unload the Stevens more than ever. The next day, he called Conrad with a new proposal. And he said, 'okay, fine. I just want -- let's go back to our original deal, just $0.5 million in profit for me'. The rest of the negotiation was quick and easy. Before Conrad Hilton knew it, his dream of owning the Stevens had come true."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And this is another dream that took a few years to materialize. "What happened next is quite remarkable. After closing the deal on the Stevens, Conrad took a meeting with Hollis, the gentleman with whom he had been negotiating the possible sale of the Palmer House. Reluctantly, he explained what had happened, that the sale of the Stevens Hotel had unexpectedly been consummated. He said that he hoped Hollis wouldn't be upset and think -- and thought that Hilton had been lying earlier when he said the sale was not going to happen, thus his interest in the Palmer House." "At first, Hollis was skeptical. 'The whole thing sounds suspect to me', he said. 'It's a matter of my integrity', Hilton told him. 'It's important that you think of -- what you think of me, and I don't want you to think I was lying'. Hollis said he might actually still be interested in selling the Palmer House, but considering all that had happened, he now felt he deserved a better price for it. Conrad agreed. So he ends up paying him an extra $900,000 more over than the deal that he had previously offered them. Hollis accepted. The two men shook hands. 'And that was all there was to it,' Hilton later recalled. 'No pens, pencils, papers, lawyers or witnesses'." So do you remember the part I said how Gus was really hard on Conrad and then, in turn, Conrad was really hard on his sons. His oldest son was kind of like a screw up. So his second son, Barron, winds up running Hilton, right? And that was his father's decision because Barron was very much like Conrad, smart, hardworking. Nicky, the older son, was an alcoholic and a drug addict and he's kind of -- I mean, for lack of a better word, he's just kind of a loser, like he'd be given an important position in the Hilton organization, and he'd be doing well for a while, and then he just started doing drugs and alcohol again.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And he would say stuff like, "Oh, I don't need to show up. My pop -- my dad owns the place." Where Barron had a work ethic similar to Conrad's, where he's in the office 6 days a week. And Conrad was really hard on Nicky to the point where like the division that Nicky was running was actually sold to TWA, the airline. And Nicky felt he didn't have anything -- like he's kind of embarrassed publicly. So anyways, he winds up trying to kill himself. He slits his wrists. And a few months later, they say he dies from heart attack, but pretty clearly that he had an overdose of drugs, this thing called like Seconal, which I guess is the same thing Marilyn Monroe was addicted to. But it looks like he killed himself, whether it was accident or not, and he left behind a wife and a 6- and 7-year-old sons. So it's extremely sad. The book, the author, this guy, J. Randy Taraborrelli, he's actually a really good storyteller because the main character is obviously the patriarch of the family is Conrad. But you get -- as you read the book, you get to know all of the -- like the Hilton family tree, and it was a giant family. Conrad had 4 kids that he claimed, 18 grandkids. Even after, like there would be divorces in the family, the ex-wives and everybody would still get together. So this is a gigantic family. I guess I bring that up because like if you're going to read the book, like you're going to learn a lot about Conrad's business, but you're going to learn more about life. And there's just some unbelievably sad -- like you see the whole scope because we see what life was like for Conrad's parents before he was born, then his entire 91-year-old -- the 91 years of his life. Then you see what happens after. There's like another probably like 100 pages after he dies, maybe less, like 50 or 75, something like that.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And you just see like what happens to all the characters in the story. So not only like -- the reason I say the author did a fantastic job and why I'd recommend you read the book is because like you have emotional attachments. There was many times where I just had like tears in my eyes reading this book, like the scenery -- the writing was so vivid where you have like Conrad as -- I think he was -- I don't know, let's say, 70 years old when Nicky died and he's at the wake of his first born son. And he's just heaving to the point where like he can't stand. This is a hard dude. Somebody that like showed no emotion throughout his whole life, didn't ask for -- like he was just a really rigid hard person, and he can't even stand, like he's collapsing under the weight of his grief and has to be supported by his two sons -- the two surviving sons on each side. Like it's just a crazy story. And like you see the experiences of maybe, let's say, 20 Hiltons and the author does a good job of telling you like where they are now. This book is a few years old. Published, I think, in 2014. But we see like what happens? What happens to Conrad's wife? She dies of a heart attack at 59. His son dies of a drug overdose at 42. His other son's married for 57 years, and she gets multiple sclerosis and she dies in her 70s. And it's just like -- I don't know, I guess it's -- we're all on this journey called life and you're going to -- like we're going to experience this. Like your loved ones are good -- like things are -- both great things and terrible things are going to happen and I think they're all contained in this book. So this is kind of like a microcosm of one family but I think it is probably applicable to everything. And then the book ends and so there's another -- one more part I'm going to read to you. But this just popped in my mind, so I'm just going to talk about it now while it's on my mind, but the book ends with the epilogue and it flash -- so the author does this amazing job of like the families – he brings it up to present day, 2010. And then the epilogue it flashes back to when the entire family is alive.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And most of these people in 2010 are dead. It goes back to 1965. It brings you back to one of their famous family dinners at Conrad's estate and you got -- you know what reminds me, have you ever watched a movie Godfather? At the end of Godfather, after Michael has taken over the family, his older brother Sonny is dead, his dad is dead, he killed -- he has his wife's husband killed. They flashback at the end of that movie. And it's when Michael is much younger, and he's telling -- everybody else is still – flashback, everybody is alive again and they're all sitting around the table. They're like the grandkids are there, everybody is there and they bring up the fact that like Michael is going to go into the armed services. That -- when I read the epilogue of this book, that's exactly what I thought of like they did the exact same thing because it's not necessarily something special happens at this dinner. It's just two or three pages of like setting the stage of this is who's there, like the person I just told you that died a few years ago, like this person is alive. And at this time, they're only 40 years old. And like their kids are there. I don't know. It's just like -- it was just a really fantastic book. And this book is actually sent to me by somebody on Twitter. They DM me on Twitter and recommended me reading this. So thank you very much. And if you have a book that you want me to read to feature on the podcast, please let me know. You can -- Founders Podcast -- add Founders Podcast on Twitter, e-mail me or do whatever you want. But I just want to close here with the regrets, and this is Conrad at 62 years old. "Now at 62, when he looked back on his life, he was, of course, proud of all his business achievements, but he did have certain regrets. He realized that with all he had accomplished, he had never had one of the most cherished things the life had to offer: fun. His greatest source of entertainment had always been trafficking in big business, making deals, courting some grand hotel, and finally, acquiring her and making her his own.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

'If I only had -- if only I had just a little of whatever it is Nicky had that made his life such a good time for him', Conrad told his attorney Myron, 'I think maybe I would have been happier'. When Myron commented that Conrad didn't seem to be particularly unhappy, he shrugged his shoulders and said, 'Well, it's too late now to worry about it. But I have to confess, I do wish I'd had more fun. If you don't mind me saying so, maybe even some more romance. Does that make me sound like an old fool'? he asked Myron. Myron smiled at him. 'Yes, it does', he told Conrad. 'An old fool, just like the rest of us'." And that's where I'm going to leave this story.

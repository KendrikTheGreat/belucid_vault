It wasn't until the second half of the 20th century that venture financing became a professional, large-scale industry. And the man who led that transformation was Georges Doriot. I can't recall exactly when I first came across the name of General Georges Doriot. But I do know that in 2002, when I looked into the Spare’s literature on the history of venture capital, his name kept popping up. I found a bunch of newspaper and magazine profiles, a chapter on him in a book or two and a short film but no full-length biography. He is the founder of the modern VC industry but there's been remarkably little written about him. He is the first person who basically ran an institutional venture capital fund, and he played a lead role in getting the VC community to see itself as a real industry. The venture capital industry began to take shape after World War II on the Northeastern seaboard, when in 1946, Doriot became president of the first public venture capital firm, Boston-based American Research and Development Corporation. The famous inventor Charles F. Kettering predicted ARD would go bust in 5 years but Doriot proved him wrong. Over the next 25 years, as his firm financed and nurtured more than 100 start-ups, many of which became huge successes that pushed the frontiers of technology and business. ARD companies led the way in developing computers, atom smashers, medical devices and new machines that desalinated brackish water. Doriot even backed George H. W. Bush's first company, Zapata Offshore. “He was very important because he was the first one to believe there was a future in financing entrepreneurs in an organized way. The more I research Doriot's life, my fascination with an idea transformed into a fascination with the man behind the idea. Doriot was one of the most charismatic characters I have ever come across. Though I've never met the man, I fell under his spell."

That was an excerpt from the book that I'm going to attempt to talk to you about today, which is Creative Capital, Georges Doriot, and the Birth of Venture Capital and is written by Spencer E. Ante. And the reason I say I'm going to try to -- I'm going to attempt to try to talk to you about this book today is because this book produced -- prompted so many disparate thoughts and ideas in my mind while I was reading it. I'm going to try to tie it together but I might not succeed. I might be all over the map today. So hopefully, you stick with me. I have an insane of highlights and notes and just tangents in front of me. So let me first tell you why I wanted to cover this book right now. I mean what caused me to push this up the queue because I have a couple of hundred books. A lot of recommendations obviously come from you of books to cover in the future. But I wanted to put this towards the top because a few weeks ago, I was -- I did a two-part series on The House of Rothschild, the Rothschild family. And there was a section in the second book that I did in that two-part series that really put together the importance of the Rothschild family and how they were able to generate so much wealth. And that book was written by Niall Ferguson. And in that section, he describes that the Rothschilds were responsible for inventing an entire new asset class. And that surprisingly was also mentioned in this book. So I'm going to read it. I'm going to skip ahead in this book. So I'm going to read an excerpt about the Rothschilds that comes from Creative Capital. And I'm going to try to tie this into how this relates to the life and career of Georges Doriot. The most powerful bank of the 19th century, the House of Rothschilds is a case in point. In the first part of the century, the Rothschild family rose to power, transforming a small merchant bank in Frankfurt and a closed exporter in England into a multinational financial conglomerate by lending money to war-torn, cash-strapped European governments. Later on, they created the biggest bank in the world, and this is the most important part, by pioneering the creation of the modern bond market, enabling British investors to buy internationally tradable bonds on other European nations with a fixed interest rate. The Rothschild made a colossal fortune by making these loans and by speculating on their rise and fall.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So that summary that's in this book is an extension of what Niall Ferguson wrote in his book, The House of Rothschild. Money’s Prophet is the subtitle of that book. It's one I covered a few podcasts back. With this idea that they created an entire new asset class, now you fast forward 200 years later, the international bond market is something over like $100 trillion, like $119 trillion, $120 trillion. And when I learned that or read that, this just blew my mind. It was like the idea that something so large and something so important was invented by just a person. It reminds me of the Steve Jobs quote, which is -- I think he said this at a commencement address. Let me actually get the entire quote real quick. This is what Steve Jobs said. And he said, "When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and that your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life. Have funds. Save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact. Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same." So think about all the industries, all the people that are involved in the international bond market today that started with just an idea, this idea that humans in the past, today, and in the future will constantly create new asset classes, okay? So that's the one idea from the Rothschild. The second thing is -- so that's like the larger picture. The second thing that was so interesting that I learned in that book is you can create an entire new asset class, right? But then inside of that, you can find something that you deem valuable. And you can collect and accumulate as much of this thing that you think is valuable as possible, right? So what I mean by that is in the book, it talks about they were obsessed with accumulating gold. And they talk about this in the letters within the family. They're like, "No, we're just going to stack. This is our old habit of accumulating gold." This isn't like the early 1800s. Think about how difficult it would be. They would buy gold all over the world. Any kind of person, government, whatever the case was, that was selling gold, they would buy it.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so when I got to that part of the book, it made me think of something else. So I'm going to try to tie this all together. And what's remarkable about the book that I'm talking about today is me and Spencer, the author of this book, have obviously read a lot of the same books. I'm not kidding. He probably mentions 25 different entrepreneurs and books that I've read for the podcasts so far. And that was one of my favorite things about this -- reading this book is because he kind of ties all this together. So one of the books that I read and that he read that he references is Titan, so the biography of John D. Rockefeller. And in that book, I would say Rockefeller's approach to the accumulation of Standard Oil stock is the same as the Rothschild's approach to the accumulation of gold. And there were a lot of people, a lot of different people who had equity in Standard Oil. Anytime they wanted to sell out, maybe they wanted to sell some stock to buy a yacht or whatever the case is, Rockefeller would buy it. And he talks about -- even way before Standard Oil is incredibly valuable, he's telling young partners in the business it doesn't matter whatever you do. And I'm going to paraphrase here. He's like, "Listen, you sell the shirt on your back but you don't sell that damn stock." And of course, many people didn't listen. He wind up taking his own advice. And we see the result, building one of the most colossal fortunes in human history, right? So that leads us to this book and why I wanted to read that. I was like, okay, so you have people throughout human history. Humans decide something is valuable way before we even had this thing called money. We know for a fact, if you study history, you're going to see that they're going to invent new asset classes. Then there's going to be things within that asset class that are going to be extremely valuable sometime in the future. So we have Georges, who creates an entirely new asset class venture capital, which in today's day and age is growing rapidly. But within that -- so you have Georges starting a new asset class. But then the majority of his wealth is going to be coming from one company that he has ownership of that, which is Digital Equipment Corporation.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So at the same time I'm reading on these books and I'm having these thoughts, I watch this -- watch and listen to this interview by Marc Andreessen. And any time I can hear Marc speak, I do. I find it very interesting -- I think he is extremely well read. And it hit me -- and it only hit me because I've listened to a bunch of talks from Marc Andreessen, right? And it only hit me because I happened to be reading these two books at the same time. And I realized Marc does something that's really smart. He combines an extensive, deep knowledge of human history in general and business history specifically, right, with paying attention to the edge of the Internet or the edge of technology. And so I thought about like why? Why is that important? I was like, oh, if you study, like if you're reading about the Rothschild, you're reading about Georges Doriot, you're reading about all these other -- the beginning of companies and all sort of stuff, you realize, okay, you get a fundamental understanding of human nature, the fact that history doesn't repeat, human nature repeats, right. And that you know in the past, we've invented new asset classes. We're currently inventing new asset classes and in the future, we will. Well, how do you discover what the new asset classes are? You hang on in ARD. You hang on the edge of the Internet. So what's the -- I would say like the largest or most well-known asset class that's been invented recently? That's got to be cryptocurrency, right? And so you have cryptocurrency in the hole. And then you have other things like something I just read about. And like on a lower level or like underneath that, like you could say NFTs is a completely new asset class. I just read -- I heard a story that's rather remarkable that can only take place on the edge of technology, where you have this guy -- this happened very recently. He went to spending something like $5,000 on an NFT. People from the outside obviously misunderstood. And we know this because we've covered this over and over again. The beginning of the company, beginning of industries, it's always going to be misunderstood by outsiders, right? So this guy spends $5,000 on an NFT. It's a picture of a rock. 19 days later, he sells it for $1.3 million. And when I hear about that, I'm like, okay, that person is speculating in a new asset class and an NFT, just like the Rothschilds were speculating in international bonds 200 years ago.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I think when he dies, if I'm not mistaken, his part of DEC when he dies, just one company, he invested over $100, right, was worth $59 million. And he dies in the '80s. So that's like -- that's -- for inflation, it's probably a couple of hundred million today. I don't know the exact number. So again, big things start -- a quote from Jeff Bezos, "Big things start small. The biggest oak starts from an acorn. You've got to be willing to let that acorn grow into a little sapling and then finally into a small tree. And then maybe one day, it will be a big business on its own." And we see that here, $3.4 million, just one company he invested for himself. Obviously, the other people involved, the founders involved, other people made a lot more money, $60 million when he dies. Okay. So it says -- this is funny. This is what we would call marketing today. Doriot -- I'm going to call him Georges because I'm probably mispronouncing his name. Georges was exerted -- Georges also exerted an influence to his writing, speeches and ARD's annual meetings. So we would call that marketing today. He believed in building companies for the long haul. That one sentence is going to give him all kinds of trouble because at the time, it's a public company. They want earnings right now. And this is something that he winds up -- a lot of his students wind up going. They move to the West Coast. They start all these venture firms. Some of them are still in existence today like Greylock. And they wind up fixing the fatal flaw that Georges had -- and I have more notes on this in the future is the structure. And he winds up -- he had all kinds of issues with the SEC. He has to go to war with the IRS. He winds up losing all of his top talent later on because he just can't compensate them. In like one case, they wind up -- like his second- or third-in-command winds up incubating a company, helping a company grow. The founder of that company makes $10 million. The person that led the investment and discovered the opportunity made -- got a $2,000 raise. So it's another example of just learning from mistakes.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so let me try to tie this all together. I think the lesson that I just learned from putting all this together from Marc Andreessen, who again is a lot smarter than I am, right? Study history so you have a fundamental understanding of human nature. Read all the time. It's funny because now you see -- since a lot of people are working remotely, Marc -- I've seen a couple like remote interviews or remote talks by him. And I think it's his house but his background is a ton of books. It's not even books in a bookshelf. He just has stacks of books everywhere. And again, this guy has unlimited -- for all intents and purposes, unlimited assets. And he's telling you, right, his actions are telling you, "Hey, there's a lot of valuable things in these books. You should probably read them." So let's go -- let's tie this together again. And I'm trying to like -- I don't have notes. I'm just trying to tell you these thoughts because I think the combination of all these ideas is very powerful and I think he's a great example of that. It's like you read all these books, you study history so you can have a fundamental understanding of human nature, right? Understand that what we're doing today may look new but the principles are not new. So you have that fundamental understanding of human nature. And then you hang out on the edge of technology and the edge of the Internet. And I think that's where you can -- if you combine these two. I mean he's institutionalized this in a business, right? You combine these two and you can create great opportunities and potential large financial rewards for yourself. So that is why I'm reading this book right now. So let's go into his biography. I'm going to give you an overview because there's not going to be this like cohesive narrative here. I'm going to give you an overview of his life. And I'm just going to go through the highlights one by one, okay? So he had like 17 different jobs. That's obviously an exaggeration. So he's the founder. He's going to be the founder of American Research and Development Corporation, which is one of the first venture capital firms ever. They call him the Father of Venture Capital. He founds INSEAD, which is one of the world's top business schools. This is in Europe because he's born in Paris then emigrates to the United States. He's a professor at Harvard Business School for 4 decades. And this is like when they didn't -- at the very beginning, they didn't really have a curriculum. And then he serves in the military. And that's why they call him General because he went to becoming Brigadier General in the United States Military during World War II. So that's the outline of his career. Let's jump into a little bit about him.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The Frenchman became arguably the most influential and popular professor at Harvard Business School's Graduate School of Business. Over 3 generations, Doriot taught thousands of students, many of whom went on to become executives at the world's top corporations. He called his course Manufacturing and this is what's so fascinating to me. He called his course Manufacturing but it was really his philosophy of life and of business. And so that's something that pops up over and over again is the way they approach. When you're reading these books, it's like one thing -- let me jumps out at you is like you really have to spend time developing your own philosophy on business and life. It's important and it should be unique to you. At Harvard, Doriot became a Yoda-like figure, dispensing wisdom to an ever-growing group of disciples. I'm going to read some of his maxims here. They're spread throughout the book. Before I do that, he stressed -- talking about what he taught to students, he stressed common sense themes such as self-improvement, teamwork and contributing to society while spicing up his philosophy with practical and pithy words of advice. And so this is just some maxims that some of his students remember him saying in his lectures. A real courageous man is a man who does something courageous when no one is watching him. If any information is to be exchanged over whiskey, let us get it rather than give it. An auditor is like a tailor. He can make a fat man look thinner or taller or younger. You will get nowhere if you do not inspire people. Always remember that someone somewhere is making a product that will make your product obsolete. And then he talks about the fact that he was just way ahead. They call him a visionary in the sense of like his ideas, many of which come to fruition many decades later and are actually only successful after other people can apply them in the future. So it says Doriot was one of the century's most visionary thinkers. He was able to recognize the importance of globalization and creativity in the business world.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And decades before economists appreciate the value of technology, Doriot realized that innovation was the key to economic progress. And that is one of the most -- for me, one of the most interesting parts of the book. And I think what is most influential to the world that we live in today is like all the value is coming from these big, stodgy companies. He's like no, the value is on the edge. It's for the start-ups, the new entrepreneurs, the engineers, the innovators, the people that have an idea and a product that will actually change. It's not coming from these big, large corporations that turn into these like slow-moving bureaucracies. So it says during World War II, Doriot played a critical role in the Allied victory and learned how to become a venture capitalist. That was actually a fascinating part I'll talk a bit more about in a little bit. As the Head of Research and Development in the Office of the Quartermaster General, he led a revolution in the military by applying science to the art of war. Under his command, the U.S. Army found substitutes for critical raw materials, developed new innovative items such as water-repellent fabrics, cold-weather shoes, and uniforms, nutritious compact food. And in one confidential project, Doriot oversaw the invention of Doron. This is interesting. It's a lightweight plastic armor that was named in his honor. For his achievements, he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General and won the Distinguished Service Medal, the highest U.S. Military medal given to a noncombatant. And then something that's throughout the book is the fact that he was capable of independent thought. This is a little bit about that. In the military, he ruffled feathers by resisting orders so he could make sure soldiers had the equipment they needed to survive in the trenches. And in the financial world, he upset the conventional wisdom by proving that there was big money to be made from patient investing in and the nurturing of small, unproven companies, something we take for granted today, right, but it was a new thought in his time. And it was through his work at Harvard Business School, he's like well, there's a deficiency. Like there's a huge gap in the market of the American economy. He's like -- so he's going to start a company to fulfill that. This is a need that ARD would fill, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he says, "ARD would solve a major imperfection of modern U.S. capitalism." New companies were starved for money and professional management. Entrepreneurs at the time had a difficult, if not impossible, time raising capital. Banks were ultraconservative, reluctant to lend money to unproven ventures. And he's saying like this is something I had a misunderstanding of before and I mentioned it to you before. It's like if you go back and you read -- like I've read a lot of books on like Bob Noyce, the founder of Intel. The early days of Apple, I've done a couple of podcasts on that. Henry Singleton, Teledyne. So I thought the first venture capitalist ever was Arthur Rock because Arthur Rock winds up having this crazy career. He invested in Intel, Apple, and Teledyne. He was on the East Coast. He was actually a student of Georges, which is in this book, which is amazing how this all ties together. But in these -- all these other books that I'm reading, Arthur pops up constantly. He's a hilarious character. I wish I can find a biography on him. But he was talking and was like, "Listen, like this thing that we call venture capital is like -- it was called adventure capital," which in my opinion, is a way better name than venture capital. But he's like, "They called it adventure capital. And all the money we would raise would come from like really -- the descendants of really rich families." So think of like the descendants of Rockefeller, the Whitneys, people like that. And so in Georges' time, because Georges is about -- Georges gets involved, I think, about 12 years before Arthur does, like a dozen, maybe like 10 years, something in there. So he says, "Listen, banks are very -- ultraconservative. They're not going to lend to unproven ventures." So the only people fulfilling this need were rich families like the Rockefellers. And he winds up co-investing with the Rockefeller Brothers Fund multiple times. And so check this out. This is the beginning. And we're going to go -- we're not going chronologically. This is -- my notes are wild for this book. So this is the beginning of the company. Think about this. We have -- I just think it's so fascinating to go back and think about like the beginnings, beginning of a company, beginning of an industry, beginning of an asset class. ARD's beginnings were modest. The first venture fund ever raised was $3 million.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says Georges often worked with the company for a decade or more before realizing any return. That is why he often referred to his company as his children. And now we get to a main theme before I read the very next sentence to you. He was all about people. He thought people made all the difference in the world. The person that actually, I think, teaches that point, how people are way more important than anything else is if you read Ed Catmull, his book, Creativity Inc., I did a podcast on a long, long time ago, maybe on the 30s, something like that. People would make the argument that Ed Catmull might be the greatest manager of creative people ever. But he has a couple of quotes from his book I want to read to you. "Ideas come from people. Therefore, people are more important than ideas. Getting the team right is the necessary precursor to getting the ideas right." And one more quote. "If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. If you get -- if you give a mediocre idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something better." Based on my reading of this book, I think Georges would agree with that quote. So he says, "When you have a child, you don't…" So let me tell you my note here. "I want to make money but I won't disregard a good person for a slightly better return. When you have a child, you don't ask what return you can expect." He was quoted in a Fortune magazine story. "Of course, you have hopes. You hope the child will become President of the United States but that is not very probable. I want them to do outstandingly well in their field." He never had children of his own. He's talking about the companies he's working with, right? And a lot of the people -- because he went to being a decade or two older, he has like surrogate sons. Like there's three people in particular that he winds up thinking of as adopted sons, for lack of a better word. "And if they do, the rewards will come. But if a man is good and loyal and does not achieve a so-called good rate of return, I will stay with him. If I were a speculator, the question of return would apply. But I don't consider a speculator constructive. I am building men and companies." And so this idea of developing relationships is extremely important.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Ken Olsen, who I'm going to talk about later, he's one of the founders of Digital Equipment Corporation, which is Georges' biggest -- like biggest hit he's ever done. They have like a very close relationship. And they had one way before Digital Equipment Corporation turned into the gigantic company that it became. And there's actually -- somebody actually sent me a book recommendation that -- there's a biography on Ken I haven't read yet. It's called The Ultimate Entrepreneur. And so that idea, "I am building men and companies," that is also very similar. We saw that there's a few people that popped in mind when I read that sentence. It's actually when you think of Bill Bowerman, Co-Founder of Nike, he was building track stars at Oregon, right? Phil Knight was one of his runners. But his concern was what kind of man you would be after you left and matured into a full adulthood. That's why his biography is called Men of Oregon. Les Schwab, same thing. Read his autobiography. He talks about, "Yes, I'm very happy that I built a successful company. I'm happy that I gave away 50% of the profits to my actual employees and made other people rich. But I was…" He said he was most proud of the people that he mentored and how, in many cases, he was considered like a second father to people that he helped get into business. A lot of them wind up asking him to be in their weddings. And he's like that's just some of the -- it was almost -- it was even more gratifying than the building of the company. So this is a little bit about his relationship with Olsen, which we'll talk about later, is a perfect match. In Olsen, Georges found the archetypal engineer-turned-entrepreneur, who is dedicated to making his company a success. I like this quote from Georges. He's describing Ken. "A creative man merely has ideas. A resourceful man makes them practical. I look for resourceful men." When ARD liquidated its stake in Digital, the company is worth more than $400 million. They were doing like -- I think right before he dies, they were doing like $9 billion a year in '80, something like that. So it says when they liquidated stake, the company was worth $400 million, yielding a return on their original investment of more than 70,000%. It was the young venture capitals industry first home run.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And then now the author -- I'm still in the introduction. This is crazy. Now the author tells us why the book was written. Georges was the prophet of this new start-up nation, the leader of a social and economic crusade that democratized the clubby world of finance more than any other person. Through his teaching, writing, and leadership in the military, academic and financial worlds, pioneered the transition to an economy built on entrepreneurship and innovation. For playing this role, Georges should be revered as much as other well-known business titans such as JPMorgan, Rockefeller or Carnegie. Hopefully, you'll agree with me after reading this book. Okay. So let's go to his early life a little bit. I want to tell you about the influence of his father because Georges is definitely a little bit of a hard-a_* or definitely a hard-a_*, extremely like Spartan, disciplined person, watching costs like a hawk. He was very concerned about like applying perfection to not only like your work life but also like your manners, the way you dress. Like he's just very like -- he ran like a very tight ship even personally. Some of that is going to come from his father. So this story, I'm just going to give you the end of it. Georges places -- he's a young kid at the time. He places second overall in his class. He runs home with his report card and he is expecting his father to be proud. And his father just looks at him and said, "Why second?" And this is the lesson that Georges took away from that. And also, this is going to be very similar to how he acts later on. He began to understand the reasons behind his father's behavior. His father, he would tell a friend years later when recalling the incident, was not concerned that Georges had failed to achieve first place in his class. No, no, no. He was concerned that Georges was happy placing second. To his father, who was a famous automobile engineer, who had raised his children to strive for excellence in everything they did, celebrating anything less than the best possible result smacked of contentment. And contentment, his father believed, is a state of mind that recognizes no need for improvement.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so this is a little bit about his father's career. Every successful man can usually point to a mentor that helped guide his career. For Auguste Doriot, that man was Armand Peugeot. So that's the head of that famous car company. How do you say that? Peugeot, okay, so Peugeot. So it says Armand recognized Auguste's mutual fascination with machines and with the future and, shortly after his return to the factory, sent Auguste on a series of apprenticeships in order to learn the latest techniques in automobile design and engineering gas-powered explosion engines, as they were called at the time. So this is the late 1800s and they're trying to figure out how to mass produce or, I guess, first make and then mass produce automobiles. And the reason this is important to the story of Georges is because his father does extremely well. It's like -- he's essentially like the right-hand man of one of the greatest industrialists in Europe at the time, right? And he leaves that job because he wants to take a risk on himself. And he starts his own company, his own automobile company, making cars under his own name. And he does well for a while. And then World War I happens, and his factory is destroyed. He had a partnership with the brothers, the Bentley Brothers, the car that's extremely popular nowadays. So at the same time that the -- France has to take over his factory to produce supplies for the war, he loses the partnership with Bentley Brothers and he winds up having to retire early. And so why is that important? Two things. One, after World War I, the family realize there's no opportunity for their son, Georges. I don't know, I think he's like 20, something like that. So they send him to America by himself. And two, for the rest of his life, because he saw what happened to his father and this is kind of counterintuitive, he was extremely risk-averse and conservative with money because he saw how fortunes -- like even when you're at the highest of highs, how rapidly things could change.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Here's another maxim from Georges and influences his thinking on creating this new asset class. "A commercial bank lends only on the strength of the past," said Georges in one of his maxims about the venture capital business. "I want money to do things that have never been done before." And then we also see something in Georges' mindset, which a lot of motivation for doing something new could be like your dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs, right? I just went over the autobiography of James Dyson. He just could not believe how crappy these -- the fact that vacuum cleaners were clogged immediately when you start using them. How the hell in 100 years of use had nobody thought a better idea. It just drove him insane. There's a lot of that with Georges because he's on the East Coast. He's at Harvard. He's back and forth between New York. He knows about -- a lot of investment bankers. And he's just like, "They're not entrepreneurs. They have no desire or focus to start anything new. They just want to work for these companies that have already been established a long time ago or these family banks that are multiple generations." And he says -- he just talks about the stuff he doesn't like on Wall Street. "They rarely, if ever, took a hands-on role and helped to nurture a company." Georges realized how critical such nurturing was in determining the success of a new venture. "I don't know anyone on Wall Street, whoever built the company. They simply furnish money, and that is the least important part of it." And so at this point in his life, he is still -- he's just a student at Harvard. He's not teaching there yet. He winds up at Henry Ford -- so I'm going to skip over a lot of stuff, obviously. It took me close to 15 hours to read the book, do all my notes before I sat down and talked to you, right? And so the author does a great job. He's talking about Alexander Graham Bell and just all kinds of people and how they finance their early ventures. So a lot of these people I've done podcasts on, they're in the archive if you're interested. So -- but one person that I have to tell you about is that Henry Ford influenced Georges' thinking. So this is a little bit about that.

In the spring of 1913, it took almost 13 hours to build the Model T, so 13 hours to build one car. By the end of the year, when a complete assembly line was in place, it only took 90 minutes. The price of the Model T could then, therefore, because you can make it way more efficient, it goes from $950. 15 years later, it's a third. It's like less than that. It's $290 or -- yes, $290. By that time, Ford was producing half the motor vehicles in the world. Europe -- and he had a frontline seat -- front-row seat at this, right, because this is what his father did. Europe may have pioneered the development of the automobile but mass production was a U.S. innovation. When Georges cracked open the pages of American machinists, machinery, this whole new industry of machinery and mass production was unveiled before his eyes. After all, automobile manufacturing was like the early 20th century's version of Silicon Valley. It was an industry transforming the world and creating vast riches for the select few who mastered the new techniques of mass production. Why is that important? Because he sees in just a few decades, it goes from this basically handmade industry to one that's generating gigantic wealth. It made Henry Ford one of the richest people in the planet at the time. Flipping through the pages gave Georges an appreciation for the dynamic nature of technology and the emerging power of America. So that is going back and forth, talking about what's happening in World War I. Georges -- every single one of Georges' cousins dies. They're all similar -- a little older than him in World War I. The country is in shambles. His family is wiped out financially. So that's when they send him to America. And I just got -- I already told you this but I'm going to read this to you. One of the things that profoundly affected Georges was his father getting wiped out financially. It affected his attitude towards risk. He was very, very cautious. And then we see a young Georges go through something that is -- every human goes through. He's on a boat, heading to a country -- well, not everybody goes through the experience but this idea of like, what does my future hold? Like what is actually going to happen to me? He had no family or friends in the United States nor much money to fall back on. He was facing the most difficult challenge of his life. Standing on the deck of the sea, looking out into the deep, dark void, Georges must have wondered, "What does my future hold? What am I going to make of myself? And what happens if I fail?"

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so we're going to see this fear of failure, it's extremely powerful. One of my favorite ways to illustrate this is if you ever hear Jimmy Iovine talk, he talks about this. He's like, "Listen, you need to make fear a tailwind instead of a headwind." Fear, in most cases, it stops people from trying. Jimmy used it as fuel. And in that great documentary, The Defiant Ones, he talks about this. Jimmy says fear is a powerful thing. It's got a lot of firepower. And then he goes on talking about making fear a tailwind instead of a headwind. Anyways, the reason I bring that up is because something -- there is like a cautionary tale to this story, too. This fear of failure turns Georges into a workaholic, 7 days a week, always on it, just completely obsessed. There is -- at the end, though, he's married. He has his wonderful marriage. They're married for like 50 years. At the end of the book, like they buy a vacation house. They're going to build a dream house. Now that he is retired. And his wife writes him a letter saying, "Now we get to spend all this time together." The next year, she gets diagnosed with cancer. Two years later, she's dead. And so this idea that you were going to put off living your life for some like future date of retirement, that you have more time, like the future is always uncertain. And so the cautionary tale because -- I'm not going to read those highlights because I'm not going to cry on the podcast. Like it is devastating. He is devastated by this loss. And he is writing her poems. He went to getting inducted into the Business Hall of Fame. And his speech is not -- he's like, "You think my life is a business story. My life is not a business story. It's a love story." And he writes a letter. He reads a poem -- like a love letter and a poem to his dead wife. And everybody is in the audience, crying. Lucille Ball is there. She winds up having the poem printed out, framed, and sends him a note that's like, "What you said touched my soul, changed my life."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And for like the -- he survives the next like 10 -- he outlives his wife for 10 years and it's just devastating. So again, cautionary tale is there. I know that -- I'm prone to this. If you're listening to this, you probably are, too. There is an element of being obsessed, working all the time. It's a mistake. It's a mistake that happens over and over and over and over in these biographies. I'm telling you, I've read hundreds of them, they all regret this. There is probably a small percentage of humans, these complete psychopaths that don't have feelings for other humans. You know I'm not talking to those people. But for a normal person, a normal driven person that wants to work all the time, if you over optimize your work life at the expense of your family, you are going to regret it. And it's obviously a difficult thing to avoid if you have some of the smartest, most productive, most capable, formidable people that you and I are studying and they make this mistake. We have to use their examples as cautionary tales. You read these poems, these letters, these thoughts that Georges is having about his wife after she died. And it is obvious he's feeling regret. And it's over, like his wife, there is no -- you can't -- that's the worst possible situation you could be at the end of your life because you can't go back and fix that. And I think the best way to hammer that point home is if you buy the book and read it. It's the last chapter. It's called Love Story. It's -- just read that chapter. It will drive that point home. And I don't think -- if that one chapter might be able to cause you to avoid making that same mistake, the price of the book is priceless. Like it’s -- there's not a better return on investment from that. Let's go to Georges when he's 26. He's working in investment banking, and he hates it. His outspoken temperament did not fit well within the staid environment of an investment bank. And he was never obsessed with accumulating extreme wealth, the chief lure of the investment banking game. So it was not at all too surprising that when the Dean of the Harvard Business School asked Georges to come back to Massachusetts and become an Assistant Dean, Georges accepted the offer. And so this is going to be his 4-decade-long association with the Harvard Business School.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so there's is a little bit about that fear of failure I was just mentioning. He was haunted by visions of failure. So Georges worked overtime to ensure that his teaching debut would be a success. And he says like, "I took this job but I don't know if I can do it. I don't know if I can teach or not." And so he figured the way to increase his chance of success, he’s spending more time at it. "At least it was a subject that I felt close to and I had studied it very hard. So I spent hours and hours and hours at night studying, and I took further courses." And then I just have a note a few paragraphs -- a few pages later, rather, good guy, Georges. Over the next 4 decades, Georges would go on to mentor thousands of other students, giving them advice, finding them jobs, guiding them in their careers, and taking an extraordinary personal interest in each and every one of their futures. In fact, throughout his 40-year teaching career, Georges kept detailed files on many of his students, which he updated on a regular basis. There's a great anecdote later in the book, where one of the students asked for advice. "Shall I take this job? I can double my salary, something like that. I have a young family." And Georges said, "No, you should go and get an MBA or whatever the case is." And so he winds up not taking the advice. He winds up getting the job. And like a couple of years later -- I think 9 years later, something like that, the student winds up running the company, being promoted to the President or whatever the case is. And Georges sends him a quick note. "You were right. I was wrong. Congratulations." So I thought that was really cool. This is -- just to understand -- fundamental understanding of this guy is he comes up with his own philosophy on everything, right? He wants to think things through for himself. In the classroom, Georges began to develop a novel educational approach. Where most professors kept a chilly distance between themselves and their students, Georges believed strongly in forming a close bond between student and teacher. From the start of his teaching career, he felt that every student deserved personalized attention. A second tenet of his early philosophy which he absorbed from his father was drilling the value of hard work into students. So he's writing a letter that says -- Georges described with a palpable sense of glee the importance of imparting a strong work ethic. "I do believe that the men leave my class, they have a definitive notion of what an honest day's work means."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The third tenet of his philosophy was an emphasis on pragmatic management, on the nitty-gritty realities of day-to-day decision-making, not highfalutin theories. A lot of this book is like personal letters he wrote. There's another book I almost read. And I'm glad I did this one first because I wanted an actual biography. It's called The First Venture Capitalist is the term. And it's -- I think almost all of it is like his writing or like the -- somebody like edited the book together. It's a lot of his notes, his letters. He also like -- writing public as well and then like reminisces from his students. But this is an example. So we have a lot of quotes in this book from his own writing. This is an example of that crazy work ethic. "I haven't had a day's rest for four months." And so right away, he becomes really good at teaching. He gets a note from his class that says, "You've given us something of far greater value than casebooks or assignments. You gave us yourself. As you paced back and forth on the deck before us, you looked upon our group not as a class but as individuals needing guidance. You gave us needed advice, encouragement, criticism. You gave us original -- you urged us into original and constructive thinking upon difficult problems and develop powers of analysis and understanding of infinite value in days to come." And so this is the effect it had on -- receiving this note had on him. It was a remarkably poignant moment for Georges, a major milestone in his young teaching career. The heartfelt note from his students proved that Georges, despite all of his doubts, was hitting a stride as a teacher. This is more on his philosophy and what that -- what his class was like. Georges began to mix some philosophy into his pragmatic teaching methods. He would stand in front of the class, pacing back and forth. And he would encourage his students to ponder the purpose of life and the purpose of business. It was a highly unusual technique. But the students realized Georges was giving them knowledge of much deeper value. He peppered his lectures with a number of pithy aphorisms, which pupils would take notes on. Here's a couple of examples of that.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

One should not only be able to criticize but should also have a suggestion to make. Another one, don't challenge other statements. Have them repeat them over again. Ask about prospects who didn't buy your product. Always challenge the statement that nothing can be done about a certain condition. He used his course as a forum to explore new subjects in business that were assuming greater value -- excuse me, assuming greater significance, in his view, such as entrepreneurship and leadership. Georges devoted one class to the process of financing and building a new company. It's really interesting how all of the experience that he's exposed in his life are going to combine together to create something new, his -- the class. Although he is teaching in Harvard, he winds up serving in a bunch of Boards, like 20 different -- the Boards of like 20 different companies. His experience in the military, his experience he saw with his father, all leads -- and his distaste for a lot of what was happening in Wall Street, all is going to culminate into this idea. It's like, "Hey, we really need to create a way to start -- to get talented young people to start more companies." Okay. So at this point in his life, he's married. They never have children but it says Georges was a workaholic with no family responsibilities to divert his energy. And so because he was workaholic and because he didn't have personal distractions, so now he's setting up -- he's doing part-time consulting with the military. He's running his class. He's serving on 15 to 20 different Boards. He's starting -- he's going back -- in the summers and going back to Paris to start this international business school. And so this is when he is approached to do ARD. And this is -- what happens is they start -- they put the plan together. And then World War II breaks out and they have to wait. And then they form ARD in 1946, after the war. And so ARD actually starts out as just like a group of New England businessmen and it's like the President of MIT. And it's -- they're going to call themselves Enterprise Associates.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So -- and this is like a very weird structure. Enterprise Associates would raise $300,000 from 20 different people to finance the final stages of promising research projects. So this like little group is meeting with various entrepreneurs. Most of these are like academic projects they think they can turn into a product, right? So they look for ideas. They wind up having a dinner. They find one company. It's this company called National Research. So a bunch of people at the dinner say -- okay, this is May 7. The reason I'm telling this date is important, May 7, 1940. They were like, "Okay. We're going to do this. We're going to fund this company, right?" May 10, Germany invades Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and France. And so most of the people who were at the dinner, who agreed to put in the money, a couple of days later were saying they're going to withdraw. It's not a good time to do this. And so this is what they learned. The people that -- like some people -- almost everybody backed out, so not going to do it. But the people that were still going to do it, there was a group of them, they wind up doing ARD in the future, right? So this is what they learn from this experience. So like the experience of Enterprise Associates taught the venture industry pioneers an important lesson. They realized it was a good idea -- it might not be a good idea to have a company with only enough money to find and study projects, right? So you have people looking for money. Then you come -- then they're saying, "Okay, we're going to work with you." And they -- essentially, they say they pass the hat around, right? So you could think about like, "Okay, we found this guy or this company. Do you want -- let's have dinner. Did you guys -- let's all throw in," right? So it says this is not a good idea. The company should have its own money instead of the money being withheld. So it says it might not be a good idea to have the company with only enough money to find and study projects then pass the hat for capital to start the new company. A company should have its own capital, they concluded. That way, it would be insulated from events outside of its control. And so it says for the time being, though, the war snuffed out the formation of the nation's venture capital industry just as it was getting off the ground. Six years later, though, Georges, Compton, and a bunch of the other members of the brain trust would revive their plans to create a regional venture movement. But first, they had a war to fight.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So I'm going to skip over a lot of his war work. But I do want to talk to you about how his work in the military during World War II actually helped inform his later career in investing in new companies. So it says Georges learned how to become a venture capitalist during the war for it was through World War II that he underwent the most significant metamorphosis of his life, transforming himself from a professor of business into a world-class builder of innovative new enterprises. When Georges became head of the Military Planning division, he began running, in a sense, his first venture capital operation. The purpose of this division was to identify the unmet needs of soldiers and oversee the development of new products to fulfill those needs. One thing he learned -- he had a bunch of different offers because he'd done consulting and stuff for the military before through his position at Harvard Business School. And so he's got a couple of different opportunities to choose like who he's going to work with. And really, the key lesson I learned from this section is like you should always -- if you have a few options, work with the smartest people you know. And so one of his former students is running the Quartermaster Corps at this time. And so he says, "I had several other offers from different parts of the Army and Air Force." But he explained the decision later in his life, "And the only reason I went to the Quartermasters is that I consider General Gregory the most intelligent officer I knew." And so one of the advantages that Georges had during this time is the fact that the limiting factor then and probably now is good people, right, people with leadership, skills and brains. And so there was all this like deficiency of staff constantly. And they're like, "How the hell is Georges finding all these qualified people?" Well, he had -- at this point, he had been a teacher for 15 years. So he's got like this Rolodex, so to speak, of just driven, intelligent people. And he -- and that's what -- something he did that was really smart. He's just maintained and nurtured these relationships for decades, in some cases, for his entire life, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

In the case of Ken Olsen, he's almost about to die. They're on a Board together. Like they've known each other for what, 30, 40 years, something like that. So this is a quote from a newspaper around this time that gives you a little indication of what that means. "I don't do the work. I just pick the right bright men to do it for me." While teaching at Harvard Business School for the last 15 years, Georges always had a sharp eye out for able, young men. Today, a lot of them are working for him and never failed to deliver for their indefatigable chief. One word is omitted from Georges' otherwise complete vocabulary. That word is "impossible." If a thing must be done, it can be done. Two good ideas for you here. So he's got a great team. But in the service of this goal -- so he's got -- they're in charge, in many cases, of making sure all the people, the actual people fighting the war have the right equipment, right? And he just winds up -- the main idea here -- I guess one of the good ideas here is in the service of this goal of building the best team, he also paid attention to details others missed. And so at the time, he's requisitioning supplies for tankers. And so he's asking the questions like, "Well, how much space is in there like we need to know." It's like no one knows. So it says before the war, no one thought to measure the foot space in the tank to see how much of the soldier's shoes would fit in such a cramped quarters or to see how soldier's shoes would fit in such cramped quarters, but Georges did. In fact, he had a tank delivered to his parking lot in Washington, D.C. So again, just paying attention to details that other people miss that are important to your job. And then the second good idea is he would break the chain of command because he didn't want the information he was getting to be filtered from other people. So what I'm about to read you is -- this is something he had in common with like the founder of UPS, who would insist on talking to drivers. Like every time he passed a driver on the street, he'd pull over and just talk to them, right? Jeff Bezos did this with -- anybody could email Jeff at Amazon.com. He wanted like unfiltered information from his customers. The founder of Kinko's, we saw him do this, Paul Orfalea, right? They all wanted -- the main theme here is they all want unfiltered information from the front line. They understood that was the most important part. And they knew that layers of managers distort the message. It's very similar to like if you play the game telephone when you were a kid. Same thing is happening when you're adults except -- because you've added all these layers of management.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, "One of the wonderful peculiarities of Georges was that he didn't want word coming back from channels and so the subscription of that. He knew it would take forever. And they'd run into people that didn't agree and they'd get stifled. He wanted us to violate all kinds of rules and regulations and just write us a letter -- just write a letter and put a stamp on it. It was a rare opportunity to express myself to someone who would read it with intense interest and start to do something about it. It would not be laid in a desk and forgotten about. It would not be stifled because of bureaucracy. It would be moved and action would be taken on it." I'll just give you an idea of the size of the organization he's running. It's 542 people when he joined. There's more than 2,000 at the peak that were working directly under him and he had a budget of a couple of billion dollars. He's also, again, working 12-hour days, 7 days a week. Okay. So let's go back into the main point of this, right? He's starting a new asset class. I'm fast-forwarding, this is 1946. They start the American Research and Development Corporation, also known as ARD. ARD was formed. This is Georges' writing in the company's first annual report, to aid in the development of new or existing businesses into companies of stature and importance. ARD was the first professional venture firm that sought to raise money from nonfamily sources, primarily institutional investors such as insurance companies, educational organizations. This was a critical development since it was greatly -- since it greatly expanded the potential amount of money that could be devoted to venture capital. And so now they're writing -- this is one of his partners they're writing about. Like you got to stop being afraid to take risks. Like that is where all the opportunity is. "We have the greatest number of possibilities for new investments. We have various means for selecting the most attractive possibilities and for spreading the risks on those selected. Does this not furnish a sound business basis for trying new methods of applying development capital?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

We cannot depend safely for an indefinite time on the expansion of our old, big industries alone. We need to create new ones, right? That's where all the opportunity is. We need new strength, energy, and ability from below. We need to marry some small part of our enormous financial resources to the new ideas which are seeking support." And this is a big headache they wind up having. The idea of venture capital was so new that ARD's founders were forced to reengineer aspects of various financial regulatory structures in order to make their idea viable. I'm going to omit a lot of this because they go into way more detail than I want to on the podcast. But there's just -- the reading of this is like there's just all these arbitrary rules. And what's so interesting to me is like they didn't just accept, "This is how it rules." Like no, they thought, "Okay. The way you have this set up precludes me from pursuing this opportunity. So guess what? I'm going to get these laws changed." Before ARD could offer its stock, for instance, it had to obtain a number of exemptions under the -- and there's all this -- and the reason I want to read all this to you is because like kind of boring in the sense that like the Investment Company Act of 1940 and these other -- like all these little weird rules and acts and pieces of legislation that have been passed decades before that would preclude opportunities that Georges and his team were trying to pursue 30, 40 years into the future. And so one way they get one of these changed is because like the guy that wrote -- so let's see. Georges was aided by the fact that one of its Board members, this attorney who was also counsel to the National Association of Investment Companies, that helped write the Investment Company Act. There's a little bit about what kind of projects they're looking to fund. The firm set clear guidelines for making an investment. Projects should have passed the test tube stage. They should be protected through patents or specialized knowledge and techniques and can afford an attractive opportunity for eventual profits.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so what they do is they say, "Hey, we raised a little bit of money. All you people doing experiments, all you people with longhaired, crazy ideas, come to us." And so they get, I don't know, hundreds of pitches. And then they only select obviously a few. This is just a few about them. I'm not going to -- they go into so much more detail. But there was like -- for example, these are some of the first few ones. The company developing a handgun that melted car engine grease by vaporizing a solvent and injecting it into automobile transmissions. They funded 2 MIT scientists who were developing a 2-million-volt generator that was 8x more powerful than existing machines. Another company that sold radioactive isotopes and made radiation detection machines. This is right at the very beginning of Nuclear Age. And then we see a quote here from Georges talking about a good synopsis of his idea. Georges best explained the formula in his 1949 annual report. A team made up of the younger generation with courage and inventiveness matched together with older men of wisdom and experience should bring success." And so part of this is -- what's interesting to me is because they're a public corporation, they have like this immense like pressure from other people who are misunderstanding maybe is a better way to put it. They were even selling assets sooner than they'd want to. This is one of their first small wins. If they held on, they could have made more money. One start-up fulfilling its high hopes was Tracerlab. Its founder, this guy named William, credited Georges with inspiring him to focus the company on its best opportunities. The General -- so everybody in the book calls him the General, by the way. "The General provides two things that a young scientific organization most needs, enthusiasm and appreciation. Like all the others, I started out with a handful of ideas and a lot of long-range plans. In a couple of years, I got bogged down in detail. Georges stepped in just in time to pull me out of the rut."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So they wind up getting their first capital gain ever. It was $37,000 when they sold 1,700 shares of Tracerlab. So he gets some press coverage, gets some wins. I'm fast forwarding a little bit. And really, his whole issue the whole time is like, "I'm trying to build a great organization and I don't have enough money. I can't raise them. Investment banks wouldn't underwrite." So he says despite the successful offering and positive coverage, Newsweek, Barron's, other outlets revealing that half of ARD's ventures were showing a profit, ARD could still not convince an investment bank to underwrite its second offering. And so this is where he expresses a frustration on the lack of money he's able to raise. "Like I have way more opportunity to pursue than money." He expressed frustration over the growing gap between the rhetoric and the reality of the venture capital business, if it could be even called a business at this point. "I'm afraid that as usual, people believe in venture capital as long as somebody else's money does it," he said. "People will make long speeches explaining that they don't want the government to finance small businesses or new businesses. But they still do not want their own money to be used for it either." Now another great thing about reading this book is like he's pretty funny. This made me chuckle. And he also talks about -- he's a bit of a hard-a**. On his desk, he kept a stopwatch. "Sometimes I use it to see how long it takes someone in a meeting to tell me the same thing three times," he said. So the book goes into all detail like -- very interesting. Like each company will have like several paragraphs of what's happening in it, what they do. But I want to point out one thing that, a large roar when you hear of people that work with Georges and raise money from him, some of which wind up being his employees in the venture firm, they all say similar things. Like he helped them manage their mindset.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so I think this is an example of that. "The General understood that this would be a slow thing," said the founder of High Voltage. "At early Board meetings, I would try to give an accurate accounting of the profit and loss. He would look through me and ask what I really thought. Georges' outlook..." and this is the founder still talking. Georges' outlook inspires and transforms my own, lifting me above the worried plane that he was on. Grappling with these myriad challenges led Georges to believe that managing talent was the most important ingredient in the start-up equation." And this is what he says about this in the note I've already told you. This is about Ed Catmull. It's very similar to what Ed Catmull said about people being way more important than ideas. So this is Georges writing in his annual report. "An average idea in the hands of an able man is worth much more than an outstanding idea in the possession of a person with only average ability." So now we're a few years into ARD. This is where one of his former students -- and that's where he recruits a lot of people. They actually want to join. I thought it was interesting in his description. And this is -- I didn't know at the time. I learned this later on the book. This is Bill Elfers, I think -- Elfers, I think, is his last name. He's one of the founders of Greylock Partners, which is a venture capital firm that's still around. And he winds up founding it all the way back in like 1960s, 1965, somewhere in there. So this is what Bill said. "It looked to me like an adventure. It was a fragile company and we didn't have a lot of money." It says Bill ended up working for ARD for the next 18 years. And I think he winds up being -- I want to say he's Georges' like second- or third-in-command. This is one of the very talented people that Georges loses because inability to compensate talent. He's going through like all these fights with SEC at the time. There's a crazy amount of detail in the book about that. But this was funny, the struggle. I really need to make sure I'm emphasizing for you like how difficult what -- he was misunderstood by everybody. He had a hard time raising money. He had to fight with regulators. They had pressure because of the structure of the business to produce immediate profits, which doesn't go along with new business creation normally, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so it says -- but he -- and then this is also going to illustrate like his personality,. Like he's really funny. Through all the ups and downs, Georges maintained his sense of dark humor. "Never go into venture capital if you want a peaceful life," he warned a group of businessmen in 1950. "Keep on financing concrete that doesn't move, that doesn't call you at 2:00 in the morning to tell you about a new human accident." And this is an update. We're about 5 years into the business. So it's very much like I'll take one step forward, two steps back, two steps forward, one step back kind of thing. By the end of 1951, combined sales of ARD's portfolio companies doubled to $40 million and total employment rose to 3,000 workers. They've made 26 investments at this point, 21 reported profitable operations. And so you have a decent beginning, but then, again, from the outside, everybody is misunderstanding. This was like at the same time that their portfolio -- they're making $40 million in sales. They have 3,000 employees of all the portfolio companies. The Dow Jones average increased 14% that year, but the prices for ARD went all the way down to $19 by year-end. People that had invested in the stock 3 years earlier were down 25%. So that's not where you want your investment to be. You've held the stock for 25 -- excuse me, for five years and you're down 25%. Georges defended the firm's poor stock returns in his letter, taking issue with the way that ARD was being compared to an investment. His answer is -- investment trust, rather. His answer was that investors needed to be more patient. "The corporation does not invest in the ordinary sense," he wrote. "It creates. It risks. Results take more time. And the expenses of its operation must be higher, but the potential for ultimate profits is much greater."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this is about -- and this is mentioned many times. Like the counterintuitive nature of their work, right, it is misunderstood by outsiders. I know I said it a lot. I have to -- like it comes up over and over again in the very beginning. And this is like the same thing, beginning of an industry, beginning of an asset class, beginning of a company, which is what you and I have mostly studied. The beginning of companies are always going to be misunderstood, right? So it says -- don't worry about the company names here they're funding. That's not important. The growing success of Ionics and High Voltage convinced ARD directors that early-stage investments in technology companies represented its best opportunities. This is the counterintuitive part. The riskiest investments they were learning held the greatest potential to -- or excuse me, held the potential to generate the greatest financial returns and the highest personal satisfaction. It was quite a turnabout in ARD's thinking. After ARD invested in High Voltage and Tracerlab, some of our friends began to say, "Oh, Lord, not another long-hair project. Why doesn't ARD back something commercial and make some money? We learned our lesson. Now -- this is the most important part. Now we realize that our best things are longhaired. So internally, they're making -- they're learning on these lessons, the counterintuitive nature of their work. Externally, ARD was clearly making progress, but investors still weren't buying the story. Much of Wall Street still viewed ARD as a freak philanthropic enterprise dreamed up by a strange collection of Harvard professors and State Street financiers. Fortune magazine noted that skeptics, particularly stockbrokers, believe that this mighty aggregation of brains had brought forth a financial mouse. So the main part of this is Georges not only having to maintain and manage the -- like the mindset of the people he's working with, he's got to do it for himself. He's got -- he feels like he's making progress. No one is understanding. It's taking years for him to explain this to people, so he's a little gloomy. Georges set down his thoughts in the state of the industry in his 1953 letter. His conclusion, venture capital is not fashionable. The search for -- and then this is what he talks about. He's like, "People are too afraid of risk. They're not understanding this." So search for security instead of hard work and daring -- they are searching for security instead of hard work and daring opportunities.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so there's a cyclical nature. At this point, people stop -- like they stop getting new pitches. He says the deal flow -- its deal flow was slowing to a trickle. "We do not know of any interesting new projects," Georges confessed in a May note he left to himself. He often wrote notes or memos like this to clarify his own thoughts. "We do not know where to find interesting projects." And so we see the sad state of affairs. It also doesn't help because he's got -- he's already tangling with the SEC at this point. And so this is the sad state of affairs. This is 7 or 8 years into his company and after the founding of ARD. ARD, their share price is destroyed. ARD shares were so beaten down that ARD was no longer seen as a growth investment. It was a value play. So the only people thought it's like the Cigar Butt version of like the Buffett people that use the Cigar Butt method. These are the people who are buying a stock now. It's like no, no -- it's not that you have growth -- large growth in company earnings in the future. It's like no, this is a value play. I thought that was funny. I mean it's not funny at the time he's going through it, for sure. It's very depressing for him, but, again, they're misunderstood. They don't know they're about to hit really hard. This is where they're going to -- I want to say 4 or 5 years from now. This is where they hit their first home run. And I guess that is a good idea for you and I, the idea that the future value is most likely to be realized when it's misunderstood by other people. And so at this point, they're like. "Okay, this project isn't working out. We should just sell." This is going to -- I'm going to read a sentence to you because this gives you a good insight into his personality. His own treasurer suggested that giving up -- they should give up and they should sell ARD. And this is Georges' response to this guy. His name is Ford.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

It says Georges wrote that Ford was a weak and uninteresting man who never believed in ARD. So he's like, "You're on my team, we're good. You go against me, you're weak and uninteresting and you have no belief." And so now we're going to go -- this is a summary that we're 10 years in, 10 years into this company, right? A decade after its founding, Georges had led ARD to a fairly successful record, thanks to 10 years of trial and error. ARD had begun to codify the principles of venture investing. It had nurtured several innovative and successful businesses. And it had found a way to deliver operating profit and a modest capital gain. But ARD had yet to fulfill its grander ambition of creating a venture capital community nor had it produced a blockbuster company of stature and importance, but that was all about to change. And so this is where Ken Olsen comes in at the beginning of Digital Equipment Corporation. I want to pull out a quote from Ken because I thought this was interesting. So this is a great foundation for a company, right? So he says -- he's talking about his own motivation for what he's trying to do. "We felt electronics was going to revolutionize industry, right?" So that's his reason for starting DEC. When we think about it, a great foundation for a company that could be applied to other things. "We felt blank was going to revolutionize blank." He filled in those two blanks with, "Electronics is going to revolutionize the industry." But if you have this fundamental belief, like Ken did, we felt blank was going to revolutionize blank. And so the description of like Ken's -- what Ken is doing at this point in his life, he's helping the U.S. Navy. He's a student at MIT. But I want to pull this out because it talks about -- he was given an opportunity. So it says in 1952, Olsen, a cocky 26-year-old, was asked to participate. So he is extremely blunt with his ideas he pushes forward. Now that word "cocky" is important. Let's go back to Nolan Bushnell. Remember, he started one of the -- if not the first, one of the very first video game companies, right? And he talks about the importance of being cocky. Perhaps everyone has creative potential but only the arrogant are self-confident enough to press their creative ideas on others.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Why is he bringing that up? Because he was a mentor for Steve Jobs. He hired Steve Jobs at 19. Steve Jobs starts Apple at 20, if I'm not mistaken. Let's go back to the full quote. "Perhaps everyone has creative potential but only the arrogant are self-confident enough to press their creative ideas on others. Steve believed he was always right and was willing to push harder and longer than other people who…" and this still important part, "who might have had equally good ideas but who caved under pressure." Steve is not one to cave under pressure. Ken is not one to cave under pressure. It talks about Ken. And then the note I left for myself here is like this makes sense why Georges want to back them because they think similarly, excuse me. So it says, Olsen despite the organization man with his perfectly trimmed hair and his immaculate gray suit. He's talking about like people working at IBM and large corporations at this time and his neat suburban track house. He believed in the individual engineer and in collaboration with small teams of colleagues that quickly develop products that change the world. Georges has that same belief, too. And so what Ken is going to do, he wants to launch a computer company that is going to make machines that were cheaper and easier to build and use than the expensive IBM mainframes of the day, which had almost like complete control of the market. And this was funny to me at this point, he's helping staff DEC, too. One of his former students comes to him, Johnson, this guy named Johnson. Johnson had two other offers, both for more money. But he visited Georges to see what he thought about the job. "You're Scandinavian, aren't you?" asked Georges. "Yes," replied Johnson. "Scandinavians work very hard," replied Georges. "I could use another hardworking Scandinavian because that's what Olsen is. You do that, you work for DEC and you make them work hard as hell." And so again, we see the importance that Georges puts on work ethic. This is very interesting to me, the predictable response about -- of humans.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he's trying to make a more personal computer -- Olsen, that is. And he was told, "You can't do this. Computers are not a toy. We've seen this before." Olsen wanted to liberate computing from the tyranny of the elite. The concept of an interactive computer was strange. Some people thought it was wrong. Computers are serious. You shouldn't treat them lightly. You shouldn't have fun with them. How -- I mean think about the world we live in, right, how ridiculous the sentiment is. And they're telling him this time -- and again, this is why it's so important because like go back to Nolan Bushnell, like cocky people are able to push their ideas. They're not going to let you -- they're not going to give up in the face of people telling them, “Don’t do this. You shouldn't have fun with them. They shouldn't be exciting. They should be formal and distant with red tape involved." That is a quote from Olsen about what people told him. Another maxim that's spread throughout the book. One of Doriot's -- one of Georges' maxims was you should always raise money when you don't need it. Having learned through hard experience than when you do not need money -- or excuse me, when you do need money, chances are you are unlikely to get it. This is very similar to the few lessons from Warren Buffett we just went over. He says the most attractive opportunities may present themselves at a time when credit is extremely expensive or even unavailable. At such a time, we want to have plenty of financial firepower, which means plenty of cash. So this is a quote I want to bring to your attention about somebody that works at ARD for Georges. So it says, "Georges was head of it and he was, more than anything else, a teacher," he said. He was in the business to test a thesis. Making money wasn't really a very high objective. He wasn't opposed to it but the salaries were modest. There was no ownership in the company for anybody. This was a mission -- there was a missionary zeal about it. "That's how Georges got away with underpaying us all because we believe we were doing something for the greater good, that we were making America a better place."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And I just want to bring to your attention, again, this is yet another historical individual, somebody who led a remarkable life, where they thought of themselves as a teacher. So we see this over and over again, whether an investor, founder, whatever the case, they talk about, "I'm a teacher." That's how they describe themselves. Let me give you a quote from the founder of Costco, Jim Sinegal. "If you aren't spending 90% of your time teaching, you aren't doing your job." So that's his quote, right? Let me give you another quote. His mentor, the guy that he -- Sol Price, the most influential retailer, without a doubt, that's ever lived, right, was Jim Sinegal's mentor. In the biography I did on Sol Price, he talks to Jim Sinegal who wrote the foreword to the book. He's also in the book because he was a mentee of Sole Price. He's giving an interview much later, when Costco is already successful. They're like, "You've known Sol Price for a while. You must have learned a lot from him." And he's like, "No, that's not accurate. I didn't learn a lot from him. I learned everything. Everything I know came from Sol Price." And what did Sol say? "You train an animal. You teach a person." And so we see this over and over again. You teach, teach, teach. And a lot of that is -- that's why I say over and over again, reputation is persuasive. You read these books. It seems like they have a philosophy, a way they want the people that they're leading to think. And they repeat that over and over and over again. They stick to these ideas for decade after decade. So now moving ahead in the story. We're about 15, 16 years into the founding of ARD. He's going to give a speech. This is where the -- why am I stuttering? The title of the book, excuse me, comes from. So he says he traveled to Illinois, where he delivered an extraordinary address. So he's talking to a bunch of security analysts and he titled the address, Creative Capital. The more insightful part of the talk focused on Georges' explanation of ARD's investment philosophy. And this is what he said. "The first tenet was that the riskiest part of the spectrum has, to date, proved the most rewarding. And the greatest capital gains have been earned in companies which were started from scratch. Second, most venture investing has not been built on achievement of dramatic overnight successes but on the steady growth of soundly based, well-managed affiliates."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So they referenced portfolio companies as affiliates. It's the word he used to use. And that's what he kept talking about. He's like, "Listen, yes, we're a public company. You want me to make money this quarter?" He's like, "All the money is in the future." It's not built -- it's built on -- the achievement is built not on dramatic overnight success but on steady growth over a long period of time. Third, technology has proved a rewarding field for American Research and is particularly well suited for Creative Capital investments. Why? He says the reason, in specialized technical areas with products protected by patents and know-how, it is easier for small companies to compete with large organizations. I think a lot of people probably still believe that but he's saying that in 1961. Then he goes into what -- like what is his role? What is his contribution in all this? He says his biggest hurdle was usually convincing these small yet proud companies that they needed outside help. Georges didn't hold that against them. He knew that if entrepreneurs weren't self-driven and a bit egotistical, they would be punching the clock for IBM or General Electric. So he has a fundamental understanding of the mindset of the entrepreneur, of the person he's working with. That's extremely important, right? He's like, "Listen, I don't hold that against you. I know you're a little cocky, you're driven, a bit egotistical. And if not, you'd be working at a big, stodgy company. You wouldn't even be interested in starting a company. You have to be somewhat crazy to want to start a company." The General closed his lecture by stressing the importance of management assistance in the venture business. There is always a critical job to be done. There is a sales door you can open, a credit line to be established, a new important employee to be found. So he's talking about all the stuff that he's helping these companies do, right, or a business technique to be learned. Venture investors must always be on call to advise, to persuade, to dissuade, to encourage but to help build. Then -- and he's talking about if you're doing this, then venture capital becomes true Creative Capital, creating growth for the company and financial success for the investing organization.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so this is also, I think, one of the benefits and what I was trying to explain to you earlier or maybe at the very beginning is the fact that you may have a belief about something that's misunderstood by outsiders but -- like Georges had a fundamental belief in what he was doing, right? He's like, "This is a great opportunity. This makes too much sense. We have to do this, right?" And for a decade and a half, people are not understanding. Eventually, they agree but they agree later, right? And what was fascinating to me is -- so ARD was majority owner of DEC, right? So Digital Equipment Corporation, this gigantic multibillion dollar company is going to happen. They own like 70% of the company, something like that, right? And they could have sold out for quick guaranteed profits. And Georges rejected every offer. And so like you have huge companies trying to -- like Xerox comes to him. HP, Hewlett Packard comes to him. All these other firms are like, "Hey, we want Digital. We want to like -- just book this profit, dude. Give us this company. What are you doing? Like just take the money and run." And Georges is like, "No." He said no. He rejected literally every single offer. And his bet, he's like, "Well, I think the company could prosper on its own. It doesn't have to be a part of a larger company." And he -- the reason I bring this to your attention now is because when he's saying that, it's like -- it's not at all certain that he's correct. And so this is Ken, who -- Georges could have just sold Ken's company out from under him. And this is what Ken said. He's like, "Listen, ARD wouldn't buy and sell companies at the first opportunity. This sounds obvious but it's very hard for someone who owns a major part of the stock to be patient. The General really preached this. And he -- and more importantly, he really practiced it." And so there's two ideas that came to my mind when I got to this section of the book. So sometimes I look back at some of the books I read and I'm like, "Man, I don't know if I should do books on entrepreneurs that are still active, right?" Like maybe that's so premature. Like maybe we should just focus on people that are very close to retirement or dead, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so a long time ago, I read a book on the early days of Snapchat. And now in hindsight, I'm glad I did because we see like what happened there. And so when I get to this section about like Georges making a really smart decision by not doing something, right? And then you look at like Evan Spiegel's decision, like he had the opportunity. Like how -- it's so bizarre to me and admirable, right, because I probably would have sold if I was in his shoes. Like compare like the two different paths of Instagram and Snapchat, right? Nothing wrong like I'm not poking fun at anybody because -- like I think the main founder of Snapchat -- or excuse me, Instagram, I think it's Kevin, I think they sell for what, $1 billion. I think he winds up getting $140 million. I don't know how old he was at the time. I don't know, 30 years old, something like that. In hindsight, he was like, "Can you believe like..." It's funny because at the time, it was like Mark Zuckerberg is insane. He's spending $1 billion for this company that's not generating revenue, right? Now if it was spun out by its own, it's what, hundreds of billions. Who -- what is the value? A lot more than $1 billion, whatever number you want to put on it, we can all agree on that. So you criticize Mark for doing it at the time. And then everybody is like, "Yes. Good for you, Kevin." Now it's like, "Kevin sold." And you can't listen to outside people but go -- he lost so much money. Yes, but how -- like if you think about you're 30 years old, right? You're not rich by any means. I don't think he was wealthy obviously at that point. It's like somebody is offering to give you money. Like you're set for life. That's -- I'm trying to set this up to realize how difficult it is to do. And so Kevin winds up losing control of his company. Later on, gets $140 million. I'm not going to hate on the dude. I'm doing -- let's say I'm most likely making that same decision, right, even if people think it's a mistake in hindsight. And maybe if you have just like this fundamental love -- let me go off on a weird tangent I had at dinner last night, too. We were talking about people that love what they do. And I was like, "You know what? I have a weird thought that' been coming to my mind lately about maybe we don't actually know that right definition of love what you do."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And they're like, "What are you talking about?" I was like, "Well, if like the person you're talking about, you say they love what they do, there's a price, right, that you could pay them that they stop doing that, right?" And they're like, "Yes." I was like, "I never thought about this, too, before I started reading all these books." But I'm like if you truly love what you do and if you want to -- this is like an extreme mindset. So I'm not saying this makes sense for everybody. But like if you truly love what you do, there's no amount of money that somebody could pay you. Like how much would you have had to offer Steve Jobs to sell Apple to you? The answer is nothing. All the money in the world, that dude is not selling Apple. How much would you have to pay Warren Buffett to not work at Berkshire? Well, he's worth what? I don't even know how much billions -- like billions and billions of dollars. He's in his 90s, still going to work. That is how you know they love what they do. So that's what just happened to be a conversation I had last night. It's also, I think, influenced by some things that I thought about when I was reading this book. So let's go back to this. It's like, "Okay. So that's the route that the Instagram chose." And you look at like still a young kid in his 20s. I forgot how old he was, right? Evan Spiegel, Mark Zuckerberg comes to you to say, "Hey, I'll give you -- that's a nice little app you got there, a nice little company. I'll give you $3 billion for it." And you ghost him. You ignore him. You're like, "No, I'm not selling it." And so in that book, I think it's called How to Turn Down a Billion Dollars, it says Evan was obsessed with Snapchat being a permanent company. And he said it was his best idea that he'll ever have and he's not going to sell his best idea to anybody else. And then also in that book, what I found interesting, and you learn is who are Evan's two heroes. Steve Jobs and Edwin Land, both of which would -- there's not a dollar you could have paid Edwin Land to sell Polaroid. There's not a dollar you could have paid Steve Jobs to sell Apple. So how the hell does this young kid have such a sophisticated understanding of that, right? And what's the result? So the note I left for myself on this page is Evan -- that came to mind when I talked -- when it talks about Georges is not selling DEC, right? If -- is Evan Spiegel's decision not to sell to Facebook, is it not one of the greatest investment decisions of all time? It has to be.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so that leads me to my second note, something -- I've subscribed to very few newsletters. There's one that I do like a lot because it's so eclectic and bizarre and it's actually free to read. It's called -- you can go to libertyrpf.com, libertyrpf.com. And I've read this quote in his newsletter. And -- do you know who Nick Sleep is? I didn't know who he was. Liberty is like an investor. He just curates a lot of interesting like ideas. And so I learn a lot from reading his newsletter. Anyways, he had a quote about Nick Sleep is just a prolific investor. I think he had like a decade where he returned like 1,000%, something like that, right? And so Nick Sleep said something that's fascinating that ties together what happened with Georges and what I just said about Evan. He says, "The best investors are not investors at all, they are entrepreneurs who never sold." Okay. So let's move on. This is, again, another -- I think one of the main points here is just the fact that like the -- if you have a fundamental understanding of your company and what's happening, it's always better to go with what you think than what the external world says. And in this case, he winds up -- unfortunately, the part of the external world is just regulated. It's just hammering him. I'm laughing. It's definitely not funny if you were Georges at this time. He feels like he's finally getting some kind of validations because they just hit real hard on DEC. And even if investors have stocks that’s rising that causes the SEC to not think venture capital, it's such a weird dichotomy here that -- to think venture capital is not that important. And he says they're -- meaning the SEC's lack of appreciation for the importance of venture capital was driving the General mad. He was always going crazy about the SEC.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The tragic irony of his bitter struggle with regulators was that they were lowering the boom on ARD just as investors and economists were beginning to recognize the significance of Georges' achievement. So now he had to fight the complete indifference of outside investors before. It takes a decade and a half then they're like, "Wait, this guy is actually right." So then they come around to him. And as they come around to him, the SEC says, "What you're doing is fundamentally not valuable and it's violating all these regulations. And we're going to hammer you." And so it's because of all these -- his hands are tied and also red tape for -- with the SEC. He just loses all of his talent. This is where his second-in-command leaves. They just -- one, because they realize, "Hey, this guy is not going to retire so I can't take it over." But also, they realize that they have to improve the structure of this -- it has to be a partnership, right? And because -- this was the example where some of them -- in the case where they're financing entrepreneur's companies. Entrepreneur has stock in the company, makes a ton of money. The SEC is like -- they're just -- I'm not going to cover the weird rules because they don't make any sense to me at all. And obviously, they've been since changed. And even the rules that weren't changed, they figured out a way to get around them with a different structure. But really, the point of like reading this is just like we do have to learn from mistakes of other people. Like we need these -- like Georges is, for instance, like the sacrificial lamb. He didn't know when they set up the company this way that this is going to -- 20 years in the future, it's going to cause him to lose all of his talent. So it says this is where Bill Elfers leaves, starts his own company. There's one more reason Elfers left. He realized, along with an increasing number of investors and new companies, that venture capital, and the stock market is mixed as well as oil and water. Elfers could see the government's increasing interference with ARD's affairs was not going to end. The SEC's letter challenging ARD's practices was received by ARD a week before Elfers resigned. And so Elfers comes up with a solution for this. He says for Elfers, a solution to many of ARD's problems was to take advantage of a new organizational form, a limited partnership. Although it might be too complicated to convert ARD into a partnership, it was not too late for Elfers to form his own.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He would not be the first person to realize the advantages of such a structure. So there are some other people in California doing the same thing. In 1961, Arthur Rock, who is an investment banker and a student -- and a previous student of Georges, when he went to Harvard, formed Davis & Rock and he adapted the old oil wildcatting business. That was interesting. The big rich, I think its Founders #149 if you want to learn more about that, adopting the old oil wildcatting business. The limited partnership offered several distinct advantages over the publicly traded investment company. So they're talking about the difference of what the people that came after Georges did that improved on what -- the mistake Georges made. But Georges didn't know his mistake when he made it, right? So it says they had distinct advantages over the publicly traded investment company. General partners who ran the firm received not only a management fee that covered salaries and expenses, they also -- in which Georges had to figure out through operating profit, right? They also received a share of the capital gains. That feature eliminated ARD's compensation problems, which led to, obviously, everybody leaving. You're not going to have talented people stay if they can't be paid well. The firm's limited partners also maintained a long-term horizon that allowed them to forgo dividends or interest payments. But this is the important part that, overall, his thesis was correct. It was really mind-blowing that you could take a small amount of seed capital and get ownership of a company that was worth more than IBM in a fairly short period of time. During the course of its existence, ARD financed 120 companies. But it was the development of Digital Equipment that allowed Georges to accomplish his ultimate goal. Georges was very important because he was the first one to believe there was a future in financing entrepreneurs in an organized way.

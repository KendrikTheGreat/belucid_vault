**“I’m building this for me. For Kid Kendrik. I owe it to him.”**  
**“I want him to be free to finally create again…create worlds to incept stories into it for the sake of playing.”**
It’s a **grown man liberating his own childhood creativity** so he can build things _for real_.

took me two decades to understand this. 20 years.
“This is probably the most personal thing I’ll ever share.”  
“But it’s the only honest way to start.”  
“I’m done with that.”  
“I don’t want to sit in that office anymore.”

“I don’t want to sit in that _self-made mind prison_ anymore.”
- “Because I didn’t stay in that office.”
    
- “I rebuilt it in my own head.”
I created it to keep the simulations going. 
To never be unprepared again.
To be able to perform when needed.
To be ready when authority needs me to be.
Sadly, logic was a lonely mans game at that time.
I was a grown ass man in a body of a child.
Scheming, simulating, strategizing, archetecting the perfect answer and deriving to conclusion.
Being able to present the most accurate logic possible to be understand by every party.

“I want to rise.”  
“I want to emerge from the learning simulation life gave me.”  
“To finally be free—and use it as a gift.”
- “Teaching me to see patterns others miss.”
    
- “To model truth over noise.”
    
- “To question easy answers.”
    
- “That clarity is my gift.”
    
- “But only if I use it.”
- “But as a real attempt to build something true.”
    
- “To share what I see. To help others see it too.”
    
- “To finally let Kid Kendrik play again.”
    
- “To build worlds. Tell stories. Make meaning.”
    
- “Not for approval. Not for safety.”
    
- “But for the pure _fucking joy_ of creating.”

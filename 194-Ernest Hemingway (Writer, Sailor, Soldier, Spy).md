Hemingway talks about one of the worst things to happen to them when he winds up having to get electric shock therapy, going through depression, his inability to read, which was -- his love, the love of his life was reading. I mean, you see that 7,500 books. Go back -- let's go back to the what he liked about Cuba. "The American writer like the choices and the freedom," remember, this is 1940s, he is living in Cuba for, let's say, 1940, maybe -- the '40s and '50s. This is wild, wild west. There's -- you got a small corrupt dictator for sure. This is before Castro, you've got the mafia, you've got U.S. businesses. It's a wild place. So he says, the American writer like , and that's what -- just like Key West, that's why he like the Keys. He like this like pirate kind of lifestyle. "The American writer like the choices and the freedom that this island offered, the well-to-do expatriate. Life in Cuba was more colorful and exciting than life at home. The rules were different. That is when there were any rules at all." Talks about some of the stuff he was into. "There was the superb fishing. There was also the shooting club. Cockfighting already illegal in many American states and Cuban Baseball." These are some of the things he loved. So I told you before, my father was actually born in Cuba, he fled almost the same exact time. My grandparents fled Cuba, the exact same year actually. No, maybe two years before Hemingway did. They fled in '59 or maybe '60. But the reason I bring that up is because I remember, and I don't understand the appeal at all, but I remember my dad taking me to illegal cockfighting to watch illegal cockfighting. When I was like five or six years old. I have no idea why Cubans like this the idea of cockfighting. I guess they do. They make a lot of money off it because they gamble stuff, but that is just something that followed as the people, hundreds of thousands, maybe I don't even know the number, it's the large number would flee Cuba for the United States, and they brought cockfighting with them.

In 2010, I was a historian for the best museum you've never seen, the CIA Museum. We were preparing to install a new exhibit on the Office of Strategic Services, OSS, America's first Central Intelligence Agency. I was tasked with finding out everything I could about this experimental organization, which included researching the company roster. Hastily pulled together to fight the Axis. OSS was an odd creature. At once a collection of men and women from the upper crust of society on America's East Coast and a magnet for astonishingly talented and creative people from all walks of life, from Wall Street lawyers to Hollywood filmmakers, even the future chef, Julia Child. In OSS, they could almost literally design their own adventures. My head swimming in research, I made an off-hand connection one day that would lead to uncharted waters. I remember reading in the past that Ernest Hemingway and Col. David Bruce of the OSS had liberated the bar of the Ritz in Paris from the Germans in August 1944. Now I wondered if there was more to the story. Hemingway would not have been out of place in the OSS. He loves secrets and the edge they gave him. He craved action but was not cut out for conventional soldering. He moved easily between social and economic classes and across borders. I thought to myself that he had a lot in common with many of the other men in the spy business, whom I met or read about. So had he been an OSS spy of some sort? What was the full story about Hemingway and intelligence in World War II? The writer had tried his hand at various forms of spying and fighting on two continents. The way stations were varied, often exotic. The battlefields of Spain, the backstreet of Havana, a junk on the North River in China. He seemed to gravitate to men and women who operated on their own in the shadows. And then I learned something that surprised me. He had signed on with another intelligence service, one that did not fit the conventional narrative of his life. That service turned out to be the Soviet NKVD, the predecessor of the KGB. A lifelong Hemingway admirer, I felt I've taken an elbow deep in the gut. How could this be? The characters he created embodied so many American values we still cherish. Truth, bravery, independence, grace under pressure, standing up for the underdog. His voice was uniquely American and revolutionary. He had changed the course of American literature in the 1920s. Why would he sign on and why would he do it secretly? His greatest work after all came from sharing, not hiding his life experiences. And so I sat on a quest day after quiet day in reading rooms all over the country. I paged through his correspondence. He was almost as great a letter writer as a novel writer. I wanted to uncover the back story. Research has always been seductive for me. It felt right for one visit to the archives to lead seamlessly to the next. One more obscure book about the Spanish Civil War or World War II or the Cold War was never enough. And so over the next three years, I filled in the outlines of the new Hemingway portrait from my unusual sources. Ultimately, I concluded that Hemingway's dalliance with the NKVD and the political attitudes that explain it made an important difference in his life and art. It influenced many of the decisions he made during his last 15 years, where he lived, what he wrote and how he acted. The chapters of the Cold War, the Red Scare, the Cuban Revolution, and two months before his death, the Bay of Pigs made things worse for him. He did not understand politics and intrigued as well as he thought he did. And for long stretches of time, he overestimated his ability to control himself and others, even to change history. In the end, he began to understand his limits and came to the tragic conclusion that the only way to reassert control was to kill himself. That is the story I tell on this book.

That is an excerpt from the introduction, that's a fantastic book that I hold in my hand and the one I'm going to talk about today, which is Writer, Sailor, Soldier, Spy: Ernest Hemingway's Secret Adventures, 1935-1961 and was written by Nicholas Reynolds. Okay. So before I jump into what I learned from the book, some highlights for you. I want to tell you how this book came about. This has been several months in the making. I knew I was -- I wanted to read a biography of Ernest Hemingway, and a lot of it has to do with this quote that Steve Jobs said when he was giving a commencement address. I think he was at Stanford back in 2003. I just want to read you what he said. He says, "When you grow up, you tend to be get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have some fun and save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact, that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you, that you can change it, that you can influence it." And then he skips a little bit and he says, "Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again." And I want to point out what one quote right there or that one word, "broader". Life can be much broader. So I knew I was going to be doing a series of biographies on writers and specifically, Hemingway because Hemingway treated life. He lived life to the fullest. He treated it like the adventure it is. And I think so few people actually do that given exactly what -- and that's what Steve Jobs was echoing. They say the prescription for life that society is giving you is so limited and life can be so much broader. It can be as broad as you want to make it. And so reading about and learning from people like Ernest Hemingway, I think serves as a reminder to you and I that life can be whatever we want it to be. It can be as broad or as narrow as you want it to be.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Okay. And then second thing -- second to the last thing I want to tell you before I jump into the book. This is probably the book that I prepared the most for. When I got this idea to read the biography of Ernest Hemingway, I was like, "Well, I can't read the biography of Ernest Hemingway if I don't read Hemingway." So I wind up reading three of his novels in order. I read The Old Man and the Sea, The Sun Also Rises and For Whom the Bell Tolls. And so once I finished those three novels, the three books, I started listening to this -- the audio book of this book. I thought I was going to read like a proper extensive biography of Ernest Hemingway. The one I picked up was terrible. I wind up giving up the quickest I've ever given up on a book because the writing was so bad. But while I was listening to this audio book, I thought it was the opposite. It was amazing. It was fun. I couldn't believe -- there's so much unbelievable things that happened in his life that are taking place in this book that over halfway through the audio book, I ordered the paperback version. And once I start reading, I couldn't put it down. So that's a clear indication that I need to make a podcast about this. So I'm going to jump right back into the book. I want to tie this just one sentence that's going to set the tone for the life of Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway was not there just to observe. And so that reminded me about the part of the book I did last week or a couple of days ago, whenever it was, on Arnold. When this guy was saying, "Hey, I'll pay for your plane ticket. You can fly to this competition just to watch." And Arnold was like, "Watch? No, no, I'm not here -- I'm not merely here to be a spectator in life. I'm here to take part." And that is definitely a main theme of the life of Hemingway. So in addition to the fact that I wanted to study Hemingway because he treated life like an adventure, I also wanted to study him because he got to the very, very top of his profession. And his work still resonates to this day. My favorite book, the book that I like the most of his was The Old Man and the Sea. And it was published in 1950, 70 years ago. And you can pick that book up today and still be wildly entertained and learn something from it.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, "By the year 1935, Hemingway had climbed to the top of his profession. Born just before the turn of the century, this ambitious young man from Illinois had started a revolution in literature while still in his 20s. His two bestsellers, The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms, reflected how much he had lived in his first three decades." "Wounded -- he was a wounded veteran by 19. Then a foreign correspondent for the Toronto Daily Star and a member of the Paris branch of the Lost Generation of legendary talented writers. The Nobel Prize for Literature that Hemingway had later received explains the appeal of his work. His writing, honestly and undoubtedly reproduced the hard countenance of the age, with the trademark combination of simplicity and precision." And I think reading three of those books, that simplicity and precision really culminates in The Old Man and the Sea. I like The Sun Also Rises as well. I like For Whom the Bell Tolls less than either the other two books. But in The Old Man and the Sea, just his brevity, his simplicity, his precision, the way he -- I'm not going to ruin the plot of the book, but essentially, the -- almost the entire story takes place with one individual by himself on a boat, and it's wildly entertaining. And again, really quick to read, which again, I really appreciate writers like Hemingway because when you read a lot, you read there's just a lot of writers that are not writing to be read. I don't know if they're writing for fellow adulation from maybe critics or other academics who are the cases, but their writing is terrible. Hemingway wrote to be read. When he wrote, he was a soul of brevity. Telling compelling stories and spare pros that spoke to millions of readers. His central theme was personal courage. He displayed a natural admiration for every individual who fights the good fight in a world overshadowed by violence and death. "Hemingway was so successful that he was now on his way to becoming a touchstone for every American writer."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he is about -- he's in his -- by 1935, that would put him in his mid-30s. So it says, he was so successful and he now became -- on his way to become a touchstone for every American writer and a role model for American individualists. That's an important -- his love of both the underdog and the individual is an important theme that we're going to revisit a couple of times today. "They were reading Hemingway, quoting him, copying his behavior and seeking his advice. He had only a handful of competitors." And on the next page is the sentence that I think tells us a lot about Hemingway. It says, "The editors lashed back that Hemingway is too focused on the individual and did not understand the powerful economic forces determining the course of history." I would say it's a key to his personality. He valued the individual. He did not think of himself as belonging to a group. And one thing I admire about Hemingway going -- tying back to this idea that he treated life as an adventure, he would live -- he didn't live in one spot all the time. The longest place he ever lived what I know is being in Cuba, but he's lived all over the world. He lived in Key West, which we're going to get to right now, but he saw the entire world. He was constantly traveling. It's amazing. It's almost like -- you've ever seen the movie Forrest Gump, where Tom Hanks, playing Forrest Gump, the character is always like every single -- there's like every single historical event he just happens to be. Hemingway has a lot of that in him, whether he's either in China, meeting the future leaders of -- the communist leaders in China. He's watching the D-Day invasion in Normandy, off the coast of France from a boat. He just happens to be there. When the Allies liberated Paris, he's there. He just has all these experiences. He just pops up like it's Forrest Gump. So this is a little bit of -- when he goes into -- this book goes into a lot of detail about where -- when he does choose a place he call home. I think it says a lot about what's important to him. Hemingway had moved to Key West. It was a place -- and remember, this is in the 1920s, okay? Let me go back to that page. It says, "It was a place where the robust, handsome sportsman, who is six feet tall, solidly muscled, can live a halfway rugged out barefoot, wearing plain T-shirts, half unbuttoned, and shorts."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"In 1928, Key West was a poor man's tropical paradise, reachable from the mainland only by rail or boats." I'm going to pause in the middle of that paragraph. If you don't know, it's the southernmost tip of the United States. It's closer to Cuba. It's 90 miles from Cuba than it is to Miami. And I've been to the Key's, I don't know, 10x, maybe a dozen times. Some of the strangest experiences of my life and strangest people I ever met lived -- happened in the Key's. It's -- even to the same, it's much more developed now than it was in Hemingway's day. Hemingway's day, it's like almost living -- and what he liked about it. So -- I'm not really -- I'm in the America, but I don't really -- I'm not really in the country. So it says, "It was a poor man's tropical paradise, reachable from the mainland only by rail or boat." Now there's a seven-mile bridge. "Many of the streets were not paved. Many of the buildings had no plumbing or electricity. The closest thing to a grocery store was a small warehouse that sold necessities." So most of the people live there. He might buy rice and beans, stuff like that, at the warehouse, but mostly they're catching. They're eating mostly seafood. He was -- he had a goal, one point, was like to be the world's best deep-sea fisherman. It was something a passion of his, his entire life. It's also why he chose to live in Key West and later in Cuba. "It was a place of shabby discomfort, good friends, gambling, $0.15 whiskey and $0.10 gin." He's definitely an outsider, definitely a misfit. He's attracted to these bizarre people and these bizarre places. Part of the island's charm was that the Mainland was far away. "Key West was a town of independent fishermen and bootleggers." And on this page is a picture of his house in the Keys. I've actually been there. And the note I left myself was, you know you were good at your job when they turn your house into a museum. So not only is his house in Key West a museum, but also his house in Cuba is a museum. Let's talk about his personality and why he might want to pick to live in a place like the Key's, which was very remote.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Hemingway placed a premium on a rugged self-reliance. So now we're going to jump ahead to Spain. The book is kind of in a chronological order, but it goes back and forth, like flashbacks and stuff. So again, it's not -- you got to read the book to get the whole story like every other books that I talk about. And this is a fantastic book. Buying copies for friends, like there is so much in this book that has -- there's like a history of everything that's going on that I have to admit, but it's very fascinating. And this is a little bit about -- I want to bring these 2 paragraphs to your attention because there's something that was very consistent with Hemingway. How many times he was within inches or minutes of death. Even when they said he was -- by the time he was like 19 or 20. He was an injured -- he got injured in World War I. He was an ambulance driver for the Red Cross. And they wind up getting shelved. But I think German artillery, I can't remember, it was -- Germans definitely shot at them. I don't remember if it was bullets or missiles or bombs or whatever, but the guy next to him wind up dying. He wind up being in a hospital for six months. In this case, he's going to cover the Civil War is happening in Spain in the 1930s, and they just light up his car. And this happens several times. So there's pictures in the book of what the car looks like, it's unbelievable. This is the subscription of what happened. "The time was the spring of 1937, the place Spain. A photo shows that the once-elegant black sedan had been riddled with bullets, probably from a passing enemy fighter plane. It is now a wreck, front tire flat, windshield shattered, one headline dangling from its socket. The car's engine is exposed." "It's hood lying useless a few feet away. The open door suggests that the passengers got out fast. Two of those passengers was Hemingway and a columnist named Joris Ivens. They stand between the camera and they wreck, miraculously unscathed. For most of his life, Hemingway like to live on the edge and take risks. But the expression on his face suggests that, at least this time, the brush with death was close enough for him." And that's also something I learned and come to respect about Hemingway. You might not agree with his views on things or the way he acts.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He is a wild, uncontrollable person, definitely not civilized by any means, but he is willing to make sacrifices and pay -- if there's going to be consequences for his actions, he's willing to deal with those consequences, both good and bad. In many cases, he puts himself in a very real possibility of dying. He is not cowardly by any means. This is just a highlight of something, most of which I'm going to omit, that the book talks about a lot. It's just the level of violence that -- because you're dealing with all kinds of -- it's a book about spying, in some cases, right? So you have the CIA, the NKVD, the British version of that. I don't remember what the name is, Japanese spies, Chinese spies. But again, this -- I'm going to read the sentence. And the reason I'm reading the sentence is because this is -- they're describing events that took place, let's see, almost 100 years ago. And this still goes on today. We just saw the same thing happened to the journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, I think is how you pronounce his name. And it says, "The NKVD would lure a Trotskyite in for an appointment, then interrogate, kill and cremate him, leaving no trace whatsoever." So let me go back to what I was just talking about why he was willing to put himself in so many danger situations, what his goal was. He wanted to be the, not a, not one of, the war writer of his generation. And his reason was war gave answers that could be found nowhere else. And again, he had a very early experience, and it's something he had experience with war from the time he is 18 until -- almost his entire life minus maybe his last decade. World War II is basically his last experience of the war. And he lived about another decade, 1.5 decades after that, but he wanted to be the war writer. Now he doesn't say war correspondent, even though that's the job he has. And he was going to wind up getting in trouble later on because he doesn't -- he's like, "I'm not here to just report." So -- in many cases, he'll pick up guns. There's so many unbelievable things in this book.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He winds up encountering these French guerrillas right before the end of the war in the liberation of Paris. And he can speak French, speaks many languages. He winds up leading them, they take over a hotel. They captured -- and he was supposed to be reporting on the war. They captured a bunch of German soldiers. Like it's -- this is going to blow your mind. It is going to blow your mind. So I do want to bring one thing to your attention that I didn't -- again, it's kind of weird when you discover one thing and then you see it -- now that I've been aware of this book, I've seen it mentioned a few times, so I was actually surprised about this. This is -- well, let me tell you what's going on in the story. So there is the Comintern. The Comintern was like an organization that was controlled by the Soviet Union that would advocate for world communism, right? And so what they would do is they would figure out a way to convince people to adopt communism is through a propaganda. So they would want to recruit a bunch of writers or famous people, actors, whatever the case is, to their side so that they can kind of preach the gospel of the Comintern. So Hemingway -- they tried to recruit Hemingway. He is never a communist. He's definitely on the left, but he is more -- he describes himself as an anti-fascist, but he was never a communist. They tried to recruit him. And even when the books are self-saying, "Oh, he signed on with NKVD." He didn't do anything with them. And this is before the Soviet Union wind up being an enemy of -- you can't call him a traitor because it wasn't -- they were ally. They were an American ally the time. But anyways, I thought that part of the book was a little bit overplayed because then I'm reading to the book, I'm like, "Okay, I listen to the audio book, right? And then I read the book." And I was like, "Where the hell did I miss the part where he's actually contributing to the NKVD?" And at the end, it's like, well, he signed on. He never really did anything with them, I was like, "All right. Well, come on." I mean he's got enough -- there's enough interesting things in his life. We don't have to overplay that part. I guess it was my interpretation of it. Maybe I missed it, I don't know, but that was my interpretation. So anyways, this is where the Comintern is trying to recruit Hemingway. And he's never going to sign on and be a full-fledged communist.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He thought -- again, he's an individual. "I like to have a loose association with fellow irregulars, fellow misfits, but I'm not going to do your bidding." He was way to type A strong personality to ever do that. But anyways, so they're recruiting him. And this other lady named Barbara Tuchman. So it says, "Barbara Tuchman, who would write the best seller, The Guns of August, which attracted the attention of JFK, President John F. Kennedy." So that book, we just learned about this book recently. On podcast #188, that was the book that Joe of Trader Joe's, the founder of Trader Joe's was reading when his company almost went bankrupt. So it's a book on war sensibly. But his point was that the book's main concept, this is Joe's point, "The book's main concept is that there are multiple solutions to non-combat problems." So that applies to combat, non-combat problems, but also to businesses. So he had the ideas that, well, there's multiple solutions and multiple paths out of impending bankruptcy. I just have to find them. And so let's go back to his time in Spain that this time in Spain, so now you see he doing reporting, but he can send ourselves a war writer. So this is what his experience in Spain are going to be -- he writes about in The Sun Also -- not The Sun Also Rises, that's about bullfighting and like Paris writers, For Whom the Bell Tolls. Okay. So we're not there yet. So it talks about like now he's putting himself in harm's way, more about his personality. Perhaps to test himself, he had not been in combat for almost 20 years. He seemed to relish going out into the battlefield with the crews. So it says, "It turned out the cameraman that he's with had forgotten his camera. Hemingway crawled back on his hands and knees to look for it while enemy sharpshooters marked his path with near misses. Bullets hit close by." This happens over and over again to him. The group that he's with, these guerrillas, they were filled with tough, colorful and educated men, as well as a few women from various countries, including the United States, the kind of people who appealed to Hemingway, it gives us some of the personality traits of people he admires.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"They were not just dreamers, but men risking their lives for their beliefs. They were authentic." So again, a lot of times when people say what they admired, and other people, its traits, that they may want to have in themselves. He definitely admired men that risked their -- men or people. They risked their lives for what they believe in and they were authentically try to do both of those. And this is interesting where he talks about the communist guerrillas that he's embedded with in Spain coming from all over. If you happen to read For Whom the Bell Tolls, the main character, Robert Jordan, I think, is the main character's name in that novel is an American, who is an American teacher who had come to Spain to help fight the Civil War, and he's the one that has the skills and winds up blowing up bridges, which we'll learn more about later on. No, no, no, we're not going to learn about it. Later on, we're going to learn about it right now. I thought this is coming in a few pages. All right. So it says, "This is the experiment." The experience I'm about to describe to you now actually happened in real life. It is the main plot of For Whom the Bell Tolls. So this is why, again, I think of -- while I'm going to talk to you more about how he approaches work because he gets this top of profession. I think that's very interesting to you and I. But really, it's about exposing yourself to a wide variety of experiences. So those experiences can influence your work. So it says, "Hemingway was with the guerrillas for four days at their camp and in the field. They loaned him a revolver and asked them to carry hand grenades and food on the 15-mile march to the objective. Setting off a dusk, the 30-man band slipped through fastest lines, traveled near but not on a road and finally under cover of darkness crawled up to a set of railroad tracks on a small bridge over a river. Before long, they could hear train in the distance and see sparks from the locomotive lighting up the night sky, the train was moving slowly enough to give them time to carefully prime their charges while Hemingway rummaged around in his pack for a camera."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, "From Key West, he felt both angry and guilty. He had seen town after town bombed to the ground. The inhabitants killed, the columns of refugees on the roads bombed and machine-gunned, killed -- shot and shot again. It was the sort of thing that kills things inside of you. He could not bear to think about his good friends who were still in the thick of things. It was better to be with them." He had -- and this is what I mean. "He had slept good and sound every night in Spain throughout the whole war. He had never felt better." These are his words. "He concluded that one's conscious is a strange thing and not controlled either by a sense of security, nor danger of death." He wrote that he had -- now he's back in Key West. This is how crazy, it says. "Now he wrote that he had bad dreams every night, really awful ones in the greatest detail. It was strange because he never had any bad dreams in Spain." I mean just think about that. You put me in a horrible environment where I could be killed at any moment, and I'm sleeping like a baby. I'm back home and a place where I love. And because the sense of adrenaline, competing for the high stakes, I feel depressed. And this is something he deals with his entire life, and this deep depression that he has bleeds in part to him when him shooting himself. And so the one thing he can do is he just throws himself into work. So it says, "For Hemingway now was the time to draw from the world and work." This is when he's writing For Whom the Bell Tolls. The only thing -- this is a quote from him. "The only thing about war once it has started is to win it. And that is what we did not do. The hell with war for a while. I am not killed, so I have to work." So one of the things I most admire about Hemingway, and I don't know how he does it, because the guy, he's made an interest in life of reading, writing, drinking, war and women. And this guy drinks, and I would speculate that, that causes -- I mean, if you drink as heavily as he did for multiple decades. I can't imagine -- I mean, not only it does break down your body, but it's got to be depressing long term, right?

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"At the guerrilla's urgent request, he turned off the flash, but was able to use the light from the explosion to photograph the attack. The bridge collapsing into the water just before the locomotive reached the riverbank. The car is coming off the rails, their iron wheels plowing up the earth before they came to rest, now useful only as scrap metal. The guerrillas did not wait for the enemy to react but started for home at once." That is just the main plot, which is a lot longer in the book of For Whom the Bell Tolls. And then this is more on how his time in Spain related to his work. "Hemingway was also in Spain as a suitor, humanitarian, military advisor and above all, writer. As he tried to explain to the guerrillas, the writer and the reporter were different. The reporter wanted facts for a story to file as soon as he could get through. The writer wanted to absorb the experience of wartime." Which is when years later, when he gets back home, it's going to make his writing more profound and resonating more because he actually saw these things. He actually experienced them. Now what was interesting is how he had a blind spot. At this time in history, there's -- whether regardless of whether you're on the left or right, they're all authoritarians. And just reminding me of advice that Charlie Munger gives, I think is really good and he's like, "Listen, avoid intense ideology. It turns your brain to mush." And so throughout his life, the closer relationships that Hemingway is going to have are forged in these areas where -- whether it's his time in Spain or in World War II, he goes through extreme experiences with these people, and he winds up with lifelong friends. And one of them, there is a guy's name Regler, Regler was -- had to flee. I think he was Jewish, so he had to flee Germany. He saw the authoritarianism that was happening in Germany in the 1930s, right? So he's a Jew and a communist. And he winds up to going to Moscow, thinking, okay, escape these authoritarians. And then he starts seeing the behavior by size like, "Wait, you guys are planning to be the enemy, but you're doing -- enemy to Hitler and fascism, but you're doing the exact same thing."

And so he tried to educate Hemingway on this. And Hemingway eventually gets us later on, but not to the degree that Regler does because he's just like, I've seen the show trials and executions and all the stuff that is happening in Germany is now playing out in Russia as well. And we saw this before. This is a podcast #159. Andy Grove winds up being -- it is essentially the third co-founder of Intel, right? His memoir swimming across only covers the first 20 years of his life. And one part of the story, Germany is controlling Hungary where he lives. And then eventually they're "liberated by Russia," and they're happy for a little bit and then they're start seeing the same thing, where the Germans would pull people out, pull his relatives out of their house and execute them. The Russians start killing people. They wind up raping his mother, and all the women living in his apartment building. And so you read that booking and first of all, it's just extremely well written and an amazing story that he survived that. But you just -- you see that there is authoritarians, people that want complete control are more like then they profess to be different. And so that's what Regler saying. Regler was living in Moscow, where he started to understand in a way Hemingway never would, what it was like to live under the dictatorship on a day-to-day basis. "Often it ominously mirrored Nazi Germany." And Regler speaks about this so much, he tries to educate it Hemingway about this, that eventually, he's forced to flee Russia too, so he had to leave, imagine living the experience of that in your life. You have to flee to anti-Semitism, in Germany, you get to Moscow, and you realize, hey, "This isn't right either," you speak up about it and they're like, "You either leave the country or we'll kill you." And I think Regler has lived the rest of his life in Mexico. One thing about Ernest Hemingway, he has a volcanic temper, which I'll go into. I don't even know if I go into today, but there's definitely a few stories in the book that express that. He also has a gigantic ego and does not think that rules apply to him at any means. And this is something we've seen a lot in his biographies. "He considered himself to be more influential than he actually was, believing that others live by what he said and wrote about Spain.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"For one, the young writer Bessie was surprised to learn that Hemingway believed that it was his speech in New York City in June 1937 that motivated Bessie to travel to Spain and joined the battalion." Bessie quoted Hemingway is saying that he knew "That my speech influenced a lot of boys to come over here." This was, Bessie continued "The kind of egomania," this is coming from his friend. "The kind of egomania, the guys suffered from. I decided to go to Spain long before I heard a speech". And this is the part I mean about the rules don't apply to him. We're still in Spain at this point. "On the battlefield, Hemingway continued to alternate between witnessing and participating in the fighting. He logged many miles with fellow journalists." This guy's name Jay Allen from Chicago Tribune and then Herbert Matthews of the New York Times. Matthews was his friend. They wind up being friends for a long time, including when Hemingway lives in Cuba, and listen what he's going to do to him. "And did not hesitate, Hemingway did not hesitate to set aside his notebook and pen when a loyalist needed his help." These are the guerrillas fighting the fascists. That's what he calls them in Germany -- excuse me, in Spain. "Hemingway called on his colleague to help move an artillery piece stuck in the mud." So he's getting in, he's like these guys need your help, we're not just here to write about it, let's actually help. "And got angry when Alan refused, claiming that he was hired to write, not fight the war." See Hemingway never made that distinction. "Nor did Hemingway appreciate the lecture on the laws of war that followed, how reporters had no legal right to carry sidearms." Hemingway was not only carrying guns, he was firing at the people. "Hemingway pitched in again when a truckload of youth, the truck turned upside down and boys were strewn along the roadway. Hemingway leapt from the car and started giving first aid, while Matthews got out his notebook and started asking questions of the injured." Oh my god. "Hemingway shouted at Matthews to get the hell out of the way, before he, Hemingway, killed him." And now we have -- so the -- the reason I want to move to this next section is because Hemingway is now looking back at his time in Spain, I remember he was in his early to mid-30s, he is -- no wonder he created a novel so many people loved.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

His soul was in it at the time. He's going to look back and realize, okay, I was a little bit too like too bought in. And his book actually talks about, which is interesting because his book made both people mad, both sides mad, because they talked about atrocities on both sides. And they're like, no, no, no, you should only talk about that side. Or I thought you were with us. It's just really interesting, just a fundamental aspect of human nature, this tribalism that we all engage in that I think I always want to be aware of, make sure I'm not like having my mind or my thoughts polluted by -- or never instinct to having us versus them mentality. So it says, "Looking back more than a decade later, he would admit, during the war that started for him in Spain, he become so stinking righteous that he gave him the horrors to look back on. For Hemingway, the Spanish Civil war was not just an outlet for a writer who wanted to be a fighter or just source material for his next book. In words and actions literally on and off the battlefield, Hemingway fought for the Republic and against fascism. Both when it furthered his career and when it did not. He was willing to make personal and professional sacrifices." So let me repeat that sentence because it's apparent over and over again. "He was willing to make personal and professional sacrifices." Okay. So now we get into in his actual work, how he actually constructs his novels and his books that he wrote so long ago, and that people are going to be reading them probably for hundreds of years from now. It's just amazing to me. So this is his state of mind as he begins to work. And we also see what he -- he understands he's -- I'm not a sick individual. That's not right way to put it. He is depressed, when he's not in combat. So it says -- and I think this is -- I'm not like trying to criticize Hemingway, this is something if you read any kind of military history for thousands of years, people have talked about this, like, they're in the most dangerous terrifying, sometimes terrible environments of their life, and they look back at it is that was the best job I ever had, that was the best time of my life.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So he still had some kind of weird discipline to wake up early. And so what he would do is he'd wake up every day before dawn and just write, uninterrupted for hours at a time till about the early afternoon, so he's probably putting, let's say, six, maybe seven hours of uninterrupted writing, and then he would go and live his other life for the other part of the day. And so he could go and fish. He would drink. He would shoot. He would date because he collected four wives throughout his life. He was a terrible husband, by the way, never faithful, had tons of mistresses everywhere. So that's just the kind of life he would want some after like a morning of solitude and writing, he would then come like he would want to hang out with friends and play cards and be physical, he was very much -- very similar to how like Theodore Roosevelt talked about the benefits of getting out of your mind into your body and doing things that are exhausting and difficult. I think Hemingway would have agreed with Roosevelt. Now let's go back to that guy Regler. The guy, the friend, I told you about that escaped Germany, then had escaped to Moscow to go to Mexico. And this is his description of Hemingway, which is his lifelong friend. And it's part of the reason why I wanted to study him, and I'll tell you which sentence jumps out of me. "Regler seemed to understand how his friends thought describing Hemingway as basically unpolitical. Ernest had a better grasp of the law of the jungle than of politics. He was more like a hunter than a politician. He thought in terms of black and white of life and death. He did not see that modern dictators had no respect even for the law of the pack." "Hemingway did not stand for Western democracy, but for -- this is the part that jumps out of me, but for experiencing life in all its fullness." But for experiencing life in all its fullness, I'll repeat it one more time, for experiencing life in all its fullness that is, I think the main point of studying people like Hemingway, because they're the reminder of how full life can be if we want it to be in places like the hills of Africa or the waters off of Key West.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

This is more about his focus while he was writing For Whom the Bell Tolls. And he wrote a lot of this, this is fascinating to me because it's not a short book. By hand, he winds up, I think, writing, there's a picture in the book where he's writing with pencil, and he think types it up and then edit it in pencil, if I'm not mistaken. He said some interesting, actually, let me think, let me grab this quote. There's a bunch of quotes about writing that he has. So he says, "Writing something that you can never do as well as it can be done." I thought that was fantastic. And then he says, "It wasn't by accident that the Geisburg address was so short. The laws of pros writing are as immutable as those of flight of mathematics of physics." So he's telling us to be brief. So anyway, there's a picture of him editing this book. Let me go back into this, during the first months of World War II, Hemingway remained deeply absorbed in his book." Occasionally, I don't know if there's like drilling happening, and I have no idea what's going on. I don't know if you guys can hear that. Sorry, if you can, I'm just going to push through though. "Hemingway remain deeply absorbed this book. Occasionally, surfacing to write letters or tend to Gellhorn." This is his third wife. She commented in a letter that, he was like an animal with his manuscript, keeping it close to him or hiding it in a drawer under other papers. He never willingly showed it to anyone and would not talk about it. So let's go back to that. "She commented in a letter that he was like an animal with his manuscripts, keeping it close, hiding it, and never talking about it." So this is the beginning of World War II. He is not -- he's living in Cuba at this point, but he's not -- he hasn't traveled to Europe yet. He actually gets hired or asked to do some like procure -- like some information gathering, something like almost like spying for United States. This comes from the U.S. Secretary of Treasury. They want him to go to China and do some research because they're about to provide -- the United States is about to provide economic support to China in their fight with the Japanese. So said, "He wanted Hemingway to go on a fact-finding mission, a common practice at the time. Senior government official might ask a prominent citizen or politician to travel overseas, immerse himself in the local scene and report his impressions."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Hemingway was flattered to be asked. This is the kind of recognition he craved. In his mind, he was more than just a novelist or a journalist. He was a sophisticate, who understood how the world worked and could use his understanding to help shape events. Hemingway thought that spying was one more of his many life skills and he was not wrong." And so during this time, we see more of his aspects of his personality, another example, he does not feel rules apply to him. And then he talks about how good it feels to be great at what you do, and then we see his preferred method like he just wants a loose association with fellow misfits. He does not want to be part of a group. "Another trait he shared with other spies was an assumption that everyday rules did not apply to him." Hemingway had been living, and this is -- also applies to his work. That's why I'm bringing it up. "Hemingway had been living by his own code for decades. In literature, it had to do with his revolutionary writing style." And he talks about now at this point of the story that, For Whom the Bell Tolls is already out and it's selling really well, and it's being reviewed very well. So it says, "He described how it felt almost too good to write as well as he could and then have his work sell. He loved things military and being around soldiers, but he did not want to join any man's army. His preference was for a loose affiliation with other irregulars which made him feel like he was part of the action, but left him free to come and go as he pleased." And this sentence tells us a lot about his personality. "Hemingway was a man who did not mind hardship, especially in the service of a cause he believed in, but he also would tolerate luxury." And we see that like he's on the battlefield, he's cold, he's in danger, he's not eating very much. And then they'll wind up taking over like a village or like a hotel and then they'll just live it up, they'll get drunk on the best wine, the best alcohol, they'll eat the best food, he'll carry on affairs, like he wants the full spectrum of life. He wants the zeros and the tens, complete and utter misery that makes them feel live and then complete and utter debauchery he will partake in both.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And this is right before he's going to travel to Europe. He's going to leave Cuba -- actually no, I'm going to -- I have some more stuff to tell you because he wind up doing this, he winds up getting like a ragtag band of spies under his own control in Cuba too, which is hilarious. But let me just tell you what he was engaging in the four years before World War II. During the previous four years, he had immersed himself in a series of life events that would have exhausted most mortals: infidelity, divorce and remarriage. Committing himself heart and soul to a last cause in Spain, cutting his ties to Key West and moving Cuba, writing a 470-page masterwork of world literature, and traveling to another war in an unknown part of the world." And that's when he went to China. Okay. So now this is about -- Cuba is almost like his muse. You can really think, it's the place where he lived the longest. He was depressed towards the end of his life because a few days before he kills himself as the Bay of Pigs and he realizes I can never go back to Cuba, like they're not going to let an American there, no matter even if I was sympathetic to their regime or whatever the case is. So it's a place he deeply, deeply loved. It says, "Hemingway was in love with the island country that was only 90 miles from Key West, it was foreign and exotic. Even before he lived there, he was repeatedly drawn back to Cuba, usually on fishing trips. By the end of the decade, he had made the island his home." So talks about a little bit about where he lived and his house, "Most rooms would soon turn into branches of the main library in Hemingway's study. Stacks of books sprouted on almost every available surface. By 1961, there would be something like 7,500 books in the house." So when I got to that part about him, Hemingway having 7,500 books in the house, I was reading a -- saw an article one time on Jim Mattis, the General, the American General, he has like a personal library of like 6,000 books, some crazy things like that. But he talks a lot about the importance of reading. And there's a quote by Jim, I kept, he says, "If you haven't read hundreds of books, you are functionally illiterate, and you will be incompetent because your personal experiences alone aren't broad enough to sustain you."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, "Last, but hardly least, Hemingway enjoyed the cool and quiet early mornings in Cuba. So conducive to writing as any other time in place, he knew. He liked to get up at dawn and work by himself." So there's that his -- the same work ethic and same preference for work that he had in the Keys. He brought it to Cuba. Cuban society also suited him. So that's another thing. Hemingway was very informal. He liked to be barefoot. And so that's something he also liked about the society and Keys and in Cuba. "Cuban society also suited him. It was much less formal than American society. As he noted happily, a man only had to put on shoes when he went into town." So it is from his residence in Cuba, his time there where he's going to work with the U.S. government and set up an anti-fascist spying group. They're looking for Germans in Cuba in the water -- and in the waters out of there. There's going to be some stories that are going to blow your mind. This guy retrofits his boat and starts hunting German U-boats. I mean it is unbelievable. Before I get there, though, I want to talk about something that was surprising to me. Let me read this to you because I had learned this previously, but a lot of people, I don't think, knew this. The eastern front, this is the fight of World War II between the Russians and the Germans, was unquestionably the most manpower and intensive theater in the war. It's scale dwarfed to most other battlegrounds in the greatest arm conflict in world history. So not only it's World War II, the largest arm conflict ever to exist, but that -- this -- the eastern front, the Ostfront is where almost everything happened. "Statistics tell the story clearly: between 80% and 90% of the German casualties in World War II would occur on this front." That is bananas, 80% to 90% of German casualties. This meant that something like four million German soldiers would die along with an estimated 11 million Soviet soldiers. So I didn't know any of this. I always tell you the person that inspires me the most, the person -- what I feels like the best podcaster to ever live was is Dan Carlin, I was going to say George Carlin, it's Dan Carlin from Hardcore History. He has a four-part series called Ghosts of the Ostfront.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I think everyone is like between 1.5 hours to 2 hours long. It's in his back catalog. So you got to go and buy it and it's worth every penny. It's worth hundreds of times what he charges for it. But it's just if you don't know anything or even if you want -- maybe write a couple of books about the Ostfront, Dan Carlin did a masterful job. There's so many anecdotes of stories that are just unbelievable, including making -- being stuck in snow, laying down your captive soldiers when it's below freezing out, covering them with water, so they freeze to death and then driving your trucks out on that. I mean there's just so many stories in that arm. And again, he's the one that taught me how important the Ostfront was to World War II. And it's just a great way to learn through his podcast. It's just a great way to learn about that. Let me go to this thing about the Crook Factory. So this is, they're setting up this count intelligent bureau in Havana, and Hemingway's running this thing. So he says, "He wanted to devote his time to different kind of intelligence operation, one that would initiate -- that he can initiate and control himself. Taking charge of something that he wanted throughout his life as a spy." This is a description of Hemingway's crew. "Hemingway had the ability to mobilize a bizarre combination of bar tenders, wharf rats down-at-heel pelota players and former bullfighters, even priests, assorted exiled counts and dukes." And this is just a crazy environment. All these people are living in Cuba at this time. Counts and dukes and several Spanish loyalists. "And all they were between 20 and 25 members of his Crook Factory. They went about their work and unusual ways." They're trying to collect information that will help the allies and usually just spying on German people. He sets them up bars and restaurants and hotels, in like bordellos. Just everywhere over the line and their job is to collect information, bring it back to the information to him. He'll then write it up, synthesize it and turn it over to the U.S., "Hemingway's leadership style may have been unconventional, but it was effective."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And this is not only in Cuba who's a very effective leadership when he chose to lead. It was really interesting because he was kind of like a lone wolf. "He inspired loyalty and enthusiasm in his workforce, despite the alcohol." Again, he's drunk all the time. Hemingway made his agents focus on detail and I don't even know how you -- I wonder if he wrote with alcohol because I know he's drinking a lot at night, but he's writing in the morning. So I'm not sure but, "His agents focus on detail and debriefed them thoroughly. After the meeting, he might stay up the rest of the night, painstakingly writing and editing reports before driving to the embassy. He would then enter by discreet side door and to deliver his information to Joyce, that was his connection, who is impressed by Hemingway' diligence." So eventually, he gets to the point, where he's like, I want to do something else. He winds up -- he has the ship called -- it's a boat, it's like a 38-foot boat called the Pilar. It's a fishing boat that he used not only in Keys but also had in Cuba, and he winds up trying to attack German U-boats off the coast of Cuba and was willing to die to do so because he hated the Germans. He know -- this is a brief description of the closest encounter that he had, and he did this for months, maybe, maybe a year. "He noticed another ship. It was a gray painted vessel, and it made his pulse quicken. He decided to investigate, proceeding at the moderate speed of seven knots." So his whole point is like what their idea was that he's collaborating with the U.S. It's like, okay, you've got a fishing boat, always just make sure that, he always appreciate fishing. Sometimes U-boats will pop up and they'll sometimes try to buy fish off fishermen or sometimes say, "Hey, we'll kill you if you don't give us like we need to redo supplies." And so they're like that may occur with you. And then you just throw grenade or you try to destroy the U-boat. And it sounds so ridiculous. "He decided to investigate, proceeding at the moderate speed of seven knots, right for a boat that wanted to look like she was fishing, not speeding to a fight. She was -- it talks about the boat that they're after. She was so large that she looked like an aircraft carrier to Hemingway's friend, now serving as first mate. The writer-sailor's reply was, No, Wolf, unfortunately, she is a submarine and pass the word for everyone to be ready to close."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"This was the moment the captain and crew had trained and hoped for. He continued to steer towards the probable U-boat, closing the distance between them, dry mouth, but happy, eager to attack. The crew broke out sub-machine guns and hand grenades," that's not an understatement. He had an entire -- his wife talks about later on, like they go on in the middle of the ocean. This is like towards the end of his life. And for 30 minutes, him and another guy have to just unload all the weaponry. They're worried about like there's a revolution coming, maybe they think that they're sympathizers. He never wanted to betray the United States. He says over and over again in the book "I'm no f traitor". That's his exact quote, even though he did not like any government. He didn't like the U.S. government. He didn't like the Cuban government. He didn't like -- he just -- he was not a fan of governments in general. He was more of the underdog more like the people trying to take control. And I think that's part of why he was so confused by Castro's revolution at the very beginning. But anyways, his idea where they're going after this German U-boat because they're pulling all these guns. They have like an entire arsenal, which is just crazy. This guy is -- the reason he's crazy because he's one of the most famous writers in the world, look what is doing in his spare time? And he wants to do this. "The crew broke out submachine guns and hand grenades, Hemingway wanted to -- they're hiding the boat -- the guns, hide his violent intentions. The Germans would only see the fishing boat trying to catch fish until it was too late." "The submarine changed course and sped up. Hemingway pursued, but the target was moving too fast. The submarine slipped from sight, so it goes under and then the Pilar floated alone on the ocean. The event was a disappointment for Hemingway the warrior, ready to die for his country. He and his crew would, as he later wrote, have all gone to Valhalla for eternity. Happy as goats."

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

"Many of the cruises that Hemingway commanded lasted for days, and some lasted, and two of them, two of them ran for close to three months. For long stretches, the crew members and only each other for company, they endured every kind of weather." Again, we see Hemingway willing to sacrifice for what he wants to do, perhaps seeking to capture some of the hardship. "Hemingway decided to name the operation Friendless." And there's pictures in the book, this is actually documented, this actually happened, which is just so crazy. The United States government hiring probably the most famous American writer or one of the most famous American writer's to do the covered operations against German U-boats. Okay. So after a while, he's like, okay, this is not where the action is, German U-boats wind up being pulled back towards the war in Europe. Europe is getting a lot worse. The Americans are already on the ground at this point. So now he's going to go, he's like, I got to get to World War II. I got to go to where the action is. And this is where I mentioned like he's in. He was like the Forrest Gump version of Hemingway. So he's in Paris, as Allied tried to take back. He's in France, when Allied tried to take Paris, he winds up -- again, he's going there "war correspondent" but he's going to take prisoners. He's going to shoot people like and he winds up leading this band of French communist guerrillas that I mentioned earlier, there Hemingway created a rather well-organized, if tiny headquarters complete with large maps tacked to the wall marking German positions and friendly petrol routes. And he literally developed intel that was useful for routes he would find routes in for the allies that were not guarded by Germans. This is just crazy. Speaking English, French and broken German, all salted with curses. Hemingway took charge. He received intelligent couriers, refugees from Paris, and deserters from the German Army, methodically gathering information and writing reports that he passed to Allied intelligence officers. He called in favors to get himself as close to the -- this is the D-day, D-day invasion, as close to the invasion beaches as possible. From a boat 38-foot landing craft, he watched history unfolding in the waters off Normandy on June 6, 1944. Around and behind him was one of the greatest armadas in history.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So now he's embedded with some U.S. soldiers, some Allied soldiers, they wind up taking over this little village from the Germans. And this is where, the note I left myself is one of the most famous writers in the world is holding you captive, pant-less. "Bruce charged Hemingway with keeping order, and he did in his own way. He has said you have come up with a novel idea of making his German prisoners take their pants off on the theory that a man without pants was less likely to escape. And then he put them to work, peeling potatoes, onions and carrots in hotel kitchen. At dinner time, he added insult to injury by making the prisoners put on frilly jackets and wait on their captures." So eventually, they progress out of the village and they went up pushing into Paris. And Hemingway, I remember, there is somebody I just recently discovered back on podcast #185, with Cesar Ritz, and that book was fantastic, but he founded Hotel Ritz in Paris. Hemingway admired Cesar Ritz' talent because they wind up taking -- at the very beginning of the book. The author talks about reading the stores. Like it's really true that Hemingway liberated the Hotel Ritz from the Germans. It says, "They escaped to the relative calm of the Ritz, the venerable establishment in the heart of Paris that was more like a chateau than a hotel." I remember on podcast #185, that was Cesar Ritz' point. He had spent a lifetime working in and managing and running hotels, and he's like, this is the human masterpiece. It's going to feel like a large townhome. It's going to feel like a home that just instead of a hotel. And so it's interesting that the description is more like a chateau than a hotel, which was Hemingway's idea of heaven and there's a quote from him. "When I dream of the afterlife, the action always takes place in the Paris Ritz, Hemingway once wrote." Now this is Bruce, who was the American Commander that was with Hemingway at this point, what he says about, he said something about Hemingway that I think I'm going to tie to another idea that I've read like three years ago, I never forgot.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So it says, "Bruce concluded that Hemingway had displayed the rare combination of advised recklessness and caution." So a combination of recklessness and caution that knows how properly to seize a favorable opportunity, which once lost, is gone forever. He's a born leader of man and in spite of his strong independence of character is a highly disciplined individual. So that is really on the fleeting nature of opportunity. Podcast #37 from the book, The Fish That Ate the Whale, which is -- or excuse me, a biography of Sam Zemurray, one of the craziest life story you ever read. Here is a quote in that book. I've never thought about -- or excuse me, never forgotten about it. And it's describing Zemurray. And Zemurray has the same kind of traits that Hemingway here has. This combination of recklessness and caution and how to seize a favorable opportunity, which once lost, is gone forever. It's a quote from The Fish That Ate the Whale. There are times when certain cards sit unclaimed in the common pile when certain properties become available that will never be available again. A good businessman feels these moments like a fall in the barometric pressure. A great businessman is dumb enough to act on them even when he cannot afford to. So still in World War II, he winds up teaming with -- this is the guy that's going to be Lanham. His name is Lanham. He's Charles T. Lanham. Colonel Charles T. Lanham. He goes by Buck. He winds up being Hemingway's best friend for the rest of his life. And so the person, he said, he's never been closer to another person than him. And this is just a quick story about them together. "After 10 days later, the two men were still testing each other. They were at dinner in an old farmhouse eating a steak dinner in Hemingway's honor when a German shell came through one wall and went out together without exploding. While most of the other diners scurried for shelter, Hemingway commonly continued to cut his meat. Lanham told his guests to move or at least put on his helmet, but he refused and they argued while more shells tore through the walls, again and again miraculously without exploding. Not to be outdone, Lanham took off his helmet and resumed eating."

"The other diners, which were Lanham's officers, returned to the table after the shelling had tapered off. Some of them called Hemingway and Lanham brave, others hinted at bravado. Lanham settled the matter. It was a full hearty test of fate. Hemingway was drawn to this writer, which, excuse me, this warrior-writer." So Buck, Lanham is a warrior that likes to write. Hemingway is a writer that likes to go to war. And so they have similar interest even though they're oriented around like one's a warrior, one's a writer, both admire the skills of the other person. And so this is Hemingway's description of him. He says, always -- he was always so much fun to be -- "It was always so much fun to be with a man who was literate, articulate, and completely brave. During a fight, he was absolutely intact, intelligent, humorous and the best company in the world." And that he continues to describe his bond that he makes with Lanham and again, another like a reminder for us that he just doesn't care about rules. They don't apply to him. "The writer who wanted to fight and the fighter who wanted to write complemented each other informed a bond as strong as any Hemingway had ever had with another man. Hemingway mused that he had never been closer to anyone as a friend than to Buck nor had he admired anyone more." So when you get -- when the war is over, he winds up getting in all this trouble because there's a bunch of other war correspondents. He's only there because he got this credential to be a war correspondent. And yet, he's the only one who really like going to war and engaging in war at the same time, keeping people captive doing what's crazy s_*_ he is doing. And so other reporters don't like that, they stench on them.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so it says, "He was now being called to account for conduct unbecoming a war correspondent. The allegations were that he had stockpiled weapons, commanded troops and joined the fight to liberate Paris." So he's all -- it's like, I can't believe this. And he says, "These allegations were all true." And so they wind up dropping -- nothing -- like they're not going to -- he's an American icon, they're not going to put them on trial in America. They did so -- they wind up dropping it. He winds up getting some kind of bronze star, some kind of award later on. But this is more about just as he has skin in the game and then he's willing to make sacrifices. And so there's a firefight, they're surrounded by Germans, "Lanham called for him. I'll be right there, wait for me was Hemingway's instant response. To get to Lanham, he dashed through a firebreak where many others had died. He stayed with their colonel until the Americans have fought the Germans to a standstill and left them no choice but to surrender. It was for Lanham another pivotal moment in their relationship, one that he would never forget." "Years later, he would write that all of the things that he had carried in his heart from those days, none was more alive than the memory of that night." And it's interesting because, Mary, his fourth and final wife. Hemingway has like one day. It accounts like what he does the day before he kills himself. And one thing he did was reread a few times, the last letter, that Lanham sent him. So there -- they had as close to the ship until Hemingway comes up. And know his job was to report on the fighting, he took the same risk as the man whose job was to fight. He went outside the wire much farther than he had to go. He was cool under pressure, willing to fight when he had to, and he displayed a sixth sense that troops call a feeling in the tips of your fingers that mark the best practitioners in the art of war. So just a description of that. Hemingway and two other guys are walking. The wars almost over but it's not over yet. Suddenly, they heard a ripping sound that only Hemingway recognized, and he shouted, "Oh, God, jump!". So they're in a car again to Walton and their driver. Seconds before a German fighter, fired a stream of bullets into their jeep. The plane came back for a second pass, again, firing down the middle of the road and missing the men in the ditch by a few feet, a very thin margin for a strafing. Again, he's almost dying.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So many times it's like, he just comes to this close to death. Hemingway calmly unhooked a canteen from his belt and offered Walton a premixed martini. Walton had never enjoyed a drink more. The three picked themselves up, brushed the dirt off their clothes and then walked on past the smoldering wreck of their ride. So eventually, he leaves Europe, goes back to Cuba and now it's time to write, and we see that same thing that happened after he left Spain. He's depressed again. This is really what he loves best. Hemingway started writing to Lanhem, telling him how much he missed him. He's absolutely home sick for the regimen he wrote that he had the "Black Ass" that was Hemingway's subscription for depression. He talks about, I have the Black Ass all the time. He handed that, he added that. He had not been depressed during the fighting when there was a war to win and had Lanhem's companionship. Same thing he was saying about his time in Spain. You see the echo there that he had learned more than -- he's telling Lanhem that he had learned more while he and Buck were together than he learned all together up until then. This was a supreme complement from a man who put so much store by living life fully. There's that theme, the main theme of Hemingway's life, right, living life fully, broad full life, living life fully and learning from it. For the writer-soldier, Hemingway, war especially ground combat was the ultimate life experience. It is wicked to say, but it is the thing that I love best. He felt most alive when risking his life, all of his senses fully engaged. Hemingway relished being useful, he relished the comradery that jelled in combat. So I'm going to fast forward because now we're going to start getting into the decline of his life. And I thought this was very interesting. So that time, after World War II in the 50s, you have the McCarthyism, where they're seeing people are seeing communists around every corner. They're pulling people in front -- famous people, mostly in Hollywood. They're pulling them. They're making them come to Cong, testify in front of Congress, swore like say I'm against communism and for America and everything else.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

And so Hemingway hates to see like this. He feels like it's a violation of like civil rights. And so he writes a letter to McCarthy, this is just funny to me. I'm just going to read, it says, "The letter itself is disjointed and obscene. Hemingway by questioning McCarthy's courage and war record. Some of us have seen the dead." And you were not one of them meaning you didn't even see combat. He tells McCarthy, that he is a s*** and invites him to come to Cuba for a private boxing match to settle their differences. And now after I feel reading his writing, studying his life, that's a very -- that's a very Hemingway thing to do. It's just something that's uniquely Hemingway, I guess. I want to -- he writes a book in between before he writes The Old Man and the Sea, which again, I feel is my favorite -- I've only read three of those books, but by far, my favorite book, I think it was fantastic. But really, I want to bring to your point like no one really knows anything and really just try to listen to your own internal instincts. This is what critic said about Hemingway about the book, and Hemingway as a writer right before he writes The Old Man and the Sea. He writes another book. It's kind of -- it's not well received by critics and they just say some of the, oh, this guy is done. And it's just like hilarious and hindsight's like, yes, he's done, he should just give up and then he rips off and writes his masterpiece. And his masterpiece for the record will be around and useful to future generations of humans, way more than your s**_*_ little criticism of him. And again, I just don't understand -- I love what Steve Jobs said one time, he was -- somebody who was criticizing him. He answers the guy's question, handles it well. And then he goes, by the way, what do you make? That's so great. Show me what you actually make or you just go around criticizing other people. And I think that's boom, you hit, you nailed -- Steve Jobs nailed it there. Like what do you -- that's fine if you want to criticize me, but like if you want to criticize Hemingway, you damn sure better be able to write a novel better than him.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

So this is what they say. And it's just so annoying to me, it's not even annoying, that's not the right word. It's just -- it's predictable, and I think distasteful and it's not the kind of human I want to be. I think the Wright Brothers had it right because back in the day, there's tons of people, super famous people, Thomas Edison, Hiram Maxim, the guy that was in the Smithsonian. I can't remember his name at the time, all trying to do what Wright Brothers trying to do, which is trying to invent powered flight. And they constantly were asked once they invented to comment on the work of other people, and they both said like, that's not something we're going to do. Every person that's pursuing their path thinks that's the path. Like it's just like I'm going to -- essentially saying, I'm going to focus on my own work. I don't need to comment about that other guys' work. I think there's a lot of wisdom in what the Wright Brothers were saying. Which pronounced -- this says, "The Saturday Review of Literature, pronounced that the book was a synthesis of everything bad in Hemingway's previous work and throws a doubtful light on the future. The New Yorker was sad that so fine and honest a writer had made such travesty of himself." "Time magazine said the book showed that Hemingway, the previously acclaimed champ was now over 50 and on the ropes. So no, they were all wrong. He's going to now release, two years after this, release his masterpiece. And this is a little bit about that. I'm going to omit some parts in case you haven't read it. I don't want to ruin the plot. The Old Man and the Sea is a novella about a poor Cuban fisherman named Santiago, who is engaged in a personal struggle for survival. Just like his other books, there's a strong indication that Santiago was heavily inspired by somebody actually new in his life. After going 84 days in his one-man skiff without a catch, he hooks a marlin that he battles for three days. I'm going to skip. I don't want to run the plot, but I'm going to get to the punch line. That is not the most important thing. As Santiago, written by Hemingway, family tells the reader, "A man can be destroyed but not defeated." That is a fantastic sentence, "A man can be destroyed but not defeated." Santiago fought the good fight and endured with style and grace. He triumphed in spirit. The book run the Pulitzer for fiction and he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature, okay? But now here's the problem. That's his greatest work, but now all the lifestyle he had, he's got a ton of injuries.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

I didn't know he had suffered multiple concussions in World War II. He had another concussion on his boat. He drank like a fish. He's a crazy person, probably didn't sleep very much. So he ages terribly. You see pictures of him. When it's like 45. And then pictures when he's 55 and was like, oh, my God, that's not a decade. That's decades man. But Hemingway did not feel great. He did not travel to Stockholm to receive the award. And instead sent an acceptance speech, there was a dark reflection on his life's work. This is Hemingway. Writing at its best is a lonely life. The writer grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his work deteriorates. But he should always strive to create something that has never been done or that others have tried and failed. And then we go into like this decline of his physical health and compounded with depression. The accident on his boat in 1950 was more serious than he let on. He's got a concussion. He fell like a gaff, which is like this big hook to like stab fish to death, I guess what it is used for, and winds up like getting a concussion, and then he had like swelling in spine. So it was more serious than he let on, and it was coming after at least two serious concussions in World War II. In January 1954, he survived, this is unbelievable, he goes to Africa. Again, he's all over the world. In January 1954, he survived two plane crashes in Africa during a 24-hour period. First, the sightseeing flight that he chartered crash-landed in dense brush in Uganda. Hemingway suffered a mild concussion, then the rescue plan that came for him the next day inexplicitly crashed and burned on takeoff to escape. Hemingway literally butted the door open with his head, seriously compounding the earlier injury. Credited for saving the lives of other people on board, there was a rupture of kidneys, a collapse of his intestine, severe injuries to the liver. Major concussions, several burns to legs, belly, right forearm, left hand, his head, and his lips. He also dislocated his right arm and his shoulder. Hemingway would never fully recover from these injuries. It marked to start of an irreversible downward spiral, one that was aggravated by various other illnesses and a deep depression.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The thought that his work was deteriorating kept him up at night, kept him up for more than one night. So not he was only injured, it's a slow multiple year realization that, okay, I cannot stay in Cuba, a place that he loved. And so it says that this is his schedule right before Castro, at least until 1957, Cuba was Hemingway's safe haven. So it says, "He could settle back into the familiar routine at the Finca that had nourished the body and the spirit in his past. He would still write in the morning, then he would swim in the pool after lunch and then take his boat into the stream to troll for marlin. If the weather was rough and the fish weren't biting, there was still shooting at his club or the occasional cockfight in the village. In the evening, he would linger over dinner with long-time Cuban friends who drop by almost every day. So he really relished, he enjoyed. It was his favorite place in the world. He did not want to give it up. And slowly, but surely, he's getting intertwined. Batista sends guards multiple times to his house. And this is like how John Wick starts. You don't bring people to your side by killing their dog. And so he had a bunch of drunk soldiers show up on time. This is a very before Castro is going to throw out Batista. And he just -- they just -- it's silliness. They come by they're saying, oh, we've heard -- they basically say, we hear there's like a rebel soldier or an oppositionists that are here. So Hemingway opens the doors like what do you want, they're reeking up alcohol and he says, listen, there's no oppositionist here. There's no revolutionaries on this property, and he's like, you guys got to get out of here. And so they wind up not even searching a house, they wind up turning around and leaving. And the next morning, his dog Machakos was found dead with a head wound, and they start coming to his property because he's got people coming from all over, like all over the world to come visit him.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

Remember he is super famous at this point. And so they come back and the rural guards come back. They come back on to the property to confront Hemingway, who calmly explained, there is like you're running a conspiracy here. Who calmly explained, they had nothing to worry about. The only conspiracy was one to drink whiskey. So this is another example of like his force and grumpiness where he's there for the revolution. And he's realizing -- he slowly but surely realizes, he's definitely pro Castro at the beginning. I don't I think that was tempered a little bit because he writes his son, no one is right, both sides are atrocious. Things aren't good, and the overhead is murder. Might pull out of there, the future looks very bad. It says by dawn, Cuba had no government and Havana was quite literally lawless. So as the years go by, he realizes the revolution becomes very anti-American as well, and that's going to cause him to -- he feels a lot of great sadness about. He's spending time, spending his time between Cuba and Idaho at this point. But he does come to realization shortly before he dies that he's never going to see his place in Cuba again. That caused great sadness to him. So this is more about his sad decline. His friends were taken aback by how much he had deteriorated over the past year. They had all seen the writer in most of his moods, but none like this, showing symptoms of extreme nervousness, depression, fear, loneliness, suspicion of the motives of others, insomnia, guilt, remorse, and failure of memory. Hemingway wrote Mary that he feared a complete physical and nervous crack-up from deadly overwork. This is one of the many pleas for help that he sent to her that month. She arranged for treatment by doctors at the Mayo Clinic, where he would stay from November 30, 1960, to January 22, 1961. So he dies, he's going to kill himself and on July 2nd. So six months after he gets out of the Mayo Clinic. What were they doing there? The main diagnosis is depression, complicated by paranoia. Hemingway's psychiatrist opted for electroconvulsive therapy. The doctors sedated Hemingway strapped him to an operating table and attached electrodes to his temples in order to run an electric current through his brain.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

The obsession still would not go away. The writer's paranoia about the government still did not lift. And then the Bay of Pigs happens, it says on the second day of the invasion, he drafted a letter to his publisher saying that he tried and failed to edit his memoirs about his life in Paris in the 1920s. Everything he tried simply made things worse. This was not a passing complaint, but an acknowledgment of defeat. He could simply no longer do the work that had sustained him. So he talks about losing his memory, which he thought it was the most valuable asset he had for his work because of the side effect of electroconvulsive therapy is memory loss. He simply could no longer do the work that has sustained him. The distant fiasco at the Bay of Pigs was another defeat, one that was almost as painful. He understood he would never be able to go home to walk under the ceiba tree to the front door of the Finca, or steer his boat out of the harbor past the old Spanish castle or spend an afternoon drinking with his friends. When she went downstairs on the morning of Friday, April 21, Mary found Hemingway in the sitting room with his favorite shotgun on in his hand and two shells on the windowsill within easy reach. For a harrowing, 1.5 hours, she generally talked to him about the things they could still do. Go to Mexico, revisit Paris, maybe even Africa for another safari. When their good friend, the family doctor arrived to take Hemingway's blood pressure, they were able to talk him into putting the weapon down. They took them to the local hospital and as soon as possible, arranged to fly them back to the Mayo Clinic for another grim round of electroshock therapy in a locked ward. On the way, he tried to kill himself twice. At the airport, he attempted to walk into a whirling airplane propeller. At the end of June, Hemingway's Dr. Mayo decided that his patient was ready to go home. Mary suspected the truth that her husband had manipulated the psychiatrists into signing the discharge papers.

![](https://www.foundersnotes.com/static/images/new_icons/chevron-down-alt-thin.svg)

He was still leaving broad hints that he planned to commit suicide. Like the letter that he wrote earlier in the month to Rene, his Cuban "son" who is keeping the Finca up. Hemingway wrote that he was almost out of gas. He was a shadow of his former self. He didn't even have the will to read a touchstone in his life that he had loved above everything. Writing he remarked was even more difficult. Hemingway asked Rene to look after his cats and dogs and his beloved Finca and assured him that whatever happened, Papa would always remember him. Despite her misgivings, Mary and George Brown, the boxer from New York, who had been his friend for decades, picked Hemingway up at the clinic and drove them back to Idaho on Friday, June 30. Two days later, Mary woke to what sounded like two drawers slamming shut, one after another, and went to investigate. She found Hemingway dead in the room where she had disarmed him in April. He had gotten up before anyone else, padded quietly downstairs, and with one of his double-barreled shotguns killed what was left of the great American writer who had fought so hard for what he believed in. And that is where I'll leave it. For the full story, I highly recommending reading the book, it's fantastic.

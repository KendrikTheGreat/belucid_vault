You capitalize on the moment...on the flow and which wave you could ride.
If it's the 5,9, 8, or 6...it even could be an 11,10 or 4 run..sometimes the game has its own soul, it's own rhythm.
So you try to catch the moment. Build around the sacret number and protect it with what you have build around the energy source...you thrive on its resources.
